You're asking me out.  That's so cute. What's your name again?
Why?
Sure have.
So that's the kind of guy she likes? Pretty ones?
do you listen to this crap?
Great
He practically proposed when he found out we had the same dermatologist. I mean. Dr. Bonchowski is great an all, but he's not exactly relevant party conversation.
Bianca, I don't think the highlights of dating Joey Dorsey are going to include door-opening and coat-holding.
I have to be home in twenty minutes.
Exactly  So, you going to Bogey Lowenbrau's thing on Saturday?
So yeah, I've got the Sears catalog thing going -- and the tube sock gig " that's gonna be huge.  And then I'm up for an ad for Queen Harry next week.
Where've you been?
Joey never told you we went out, did he?
He was, like, a total babe
I just wanted --
Patrick -- is that- a.
Daddy, I --
Daddy, people expect me to be there!
Oh, God.  It's starting.
You the new guy?
Who is she?
Why not?
Guess who just signed up for a tutor?
I'm serious, man, he's whacked.  He sold his own liver on the black market so he could buy new speakers.
He's pretty!
Assail your ears for one night.
You makin' any headway?
I can't take a girl like that out on twenty bucks.
Take it or leave it.  This isn't a negotiation.
Hey.
Nope - just came by to chat
He always look so
What's this?
You think this'll work?
You went to the party?  I thought we were officially opposed to suburban social activity.
You didn't have a choice?  Where's Kat and what have you done with her?
You ' re looking at this from the wrong perspective.  We're making a statement.
I mean Wo-man.  How ya doin'?
Are you following me?
Uh, uh. You lie down and you'll go to sleep
This is so patronizing.
Dorsey.
I know.  It'd have to be a pretty big deal to get you to mainline tequila. You don't seem like the type.
No, you weren't
So what ' s up with your dad?  He a pain in the ass?
Unwelcome?  I guess someone still has her panties in a twist.
Tell me something true.
What?
Create a little drama?  Start a new rumor?  What?
You tell me.
Answer the question, Patrick
It's just something I had.  You know
Wait I...
Oh, Bianca?  Can you get me my freshman yearbook?
This from someone whose diary is devoted to favorite grooming tips?
Why can't we agree on this?
You're eighteen.  You don't know what you want.  You won't know until you're forty-five and you don't have it.
I don't understand the allure of dehydrated food.  Is this something I should be hip to?
Which parts?
You know, fathers don't like to admit that their daughters are capable of running their own lives.  It means we've become spectators.  Bianca still lets me play a few innings.  You've had me on the bleachers for years.  When you go to Sarah Lawrence, I won't even be able to watch the game.
Tempestuous?
What plan?
You two are gonna help me tame the wild beast?
Are you telling me I'm a -  "non-smoker"?
I missed you.
What's a synonym for throbbing?
Jesus!  Can a man even grab a sandwich before you women start dilating?
They'll dance, they'll kiss, they'll come home.  Let her go.
What do you wanna watch?  We've got crap, crap, crap or crap
I never seen heat like this!  Not even in Las Minas!
You say Asia can be found by sailing west?
Your Eminence, there is only one way to settle the matter.  And that is to make the journey.  I am ready to risk my life to prove it possible.
Trade, Your Excellency.  According to Marco Polo, the Kingdom of China is one of the richest of the world. Even the meanest buildings are roofed with gold.
Asia can be found to the west -- and I will prove it.
It won't be easy to get rid of your prophet now, Don Sanchez.
You can see for yourself.
I could be gone for years.
I'm not asking you to swear to anything.
Can't you stay with us a little?
What is it, now?  Tell me...
I understand that you will soon be appointing Governors for the islands?  Is it not so?
All I have to do is call the guards.
I am not afraid of you.  You are nothing but a dreamer.
How did you manage it?
You get so carried away when you are being contradicted!
All of them!  Just lies!
How long?
My son, my son...  Your certitudes are sometimes frightening...  Christopher, you must speak to them. And if you don't I will.
I know what I see.  I see someone who doesn't accept the world as it is.  Who's not afraid.  I see a women who thinks... "What if?"...
In one act of brutality, you have created chaos.  Tribes who were fighting each other are now joining forces against us!  All that because of your criminal savagery!
Due west, Captain Mendez.  And may God be with us...
What do you read?
What's he doing?
You must be mad...!
Jesus Maria!  I should have never listened to you!
Oh no!  No!  Shit!
Don't say anything.
I brought you some letters.  It's really fan mail.  Women mostly.  One wants to buy you clothes, another sent a check. Another wants a check.
Back in the Czech Republic?
I'm abused.  Don't you think?
Did you ever turn tricks before?
I came here.  I had no money.  I knew no one.  I couldn't get a job because you have to have a green card to get work. They approached me - I could've made a lot of money.  I considered it, but... it's not who I am.  They pay me below the table at Ludwig's.
What are you asking me?
I'm not a whore.  I'm not a whore.
Is he your boyfriend?
A good Immigration lawyer could stall the process.  Eddie recommended one.
You better get packed.
Do you have coffee?
Look, we can help you but right now we have to deal with what's happening here. Tell us the truth...is that the truth?
Who did cause and origin?
Hey, Chief, what are you doing here?
Forgot?  You handcuffed a civilian to a tree?!
Did the D.A. videotape her deposition?
Tomorrow.  At lunch.
Only one guys checked in?
Who's there?
You know what that is, right?
Maybe it's a ritual thing or someone trying to send a message.  Burial rites are taken very seriously in Eastern Europe.  It could be to humiliate them. Just burning them up, no proper funeral, it's like condemning them to hell.
I'll come with you.
I can watch you, Eddie.  Maybe I'll learn something.
My folks are.
Mind if I ride along with you?
Tell you what - I'll flip you a coin. If you win you can come with me.  If you don't win, you don't come.
So am I.  Alright, I'll go inside and you cover the back.
What are you hiding?  Why are you afraid
She's fucked.  Even if that story is true.
I took her there for a shower and that's it.
I told you, you know, I thought I was doing the right thing, you know, I think she's innocent.
So...who's Nicky?
Your opinion.  You see, they going to make a movie about me, too, Eddie.  And write books.
So tabloids don't have to do re enactments.  They going to have real movie this time.
You really think you'll be able to fool a jury with this bullshit?  How fuckin' stupid are you?
Can we go up to the crime scene?
Do you have the suspect in custody?
Alright.
Stop it.
Alright, alright, Eddie.  Don't patronize me.
No.  Tell me what you want to say.
No.  No, listen to me here.  I want to know what you're talking about.  You know, the shoe thing and the marriages and...
Yeah.  I'll do that.  As long as you're not patronizing me.
So we're waitin' to hit this warrant - we got Emergency Service with the heavy weapons standin' by - ready to go.  I say, lemme get a cigar outta the car.  I go to get the cigar and BOOM!  All the sudden I turn around and a kid with a shotgun let one go.  Right where I was standin'.  That coulda been it.  I coulda had my head blown off and for what?  Some stupid kid got panicky, takes the safety off and it's over.  If I hadn't gone back for that cigar - for a bad habit - I would've had my head blown off.
So what's unique?
I hope this prick doesn't run.  My knees are killing me.  Stay behind me.
Are you married?
If you don't want my film - I'll call another show.  And they will show it.
You can't kill me.  You're not a cop. Just fireman with a gun.  I bet you never shot anybody in your life.
Now I like to get business out of the way before we get down to pleasure.  Why don'tchya put my money on the dresser.
Who is he?
This all you want?
Did you hear what I said?
Look.  Times Square.  Just like in the movies!
What?
Speak English!
No.  We are insane.  Who else but crazy men would film their murders?  So we kill someone famous and if we are caught, we are sent to mental hospital. But what good is money there?  Because once in hospital I say I not crazy. Just pretended to be acquitted.  We see psychiatrists.  They must certify we are sane and because of your - what is law called?  Oh - I got it.  Because of your Double Jeopardy law, we can't be tried for same crime twice.  We come out free, rich and famous!
I'm serious.
I'm serious...this - this is a great American film.  Full of violence and sex.  And I want my credit.
You got that?
We spent it!
Robert...?
You outta be ashamed.  Ashamed of yourself.
A cheap hotel.
Got any spare change?  How 'bout a spare twenty?
Okay, you're under arrest!  Now you happy?
I'll send a cop back for you.
You okay?
What's that on your forehead, Max? That's a nice attention getter.
How did you start the fire this time?
Where you been, man?  We got a celebrity!
Get outta here!
What are you gonna do?
CONTINUED
CONTINUED
Not really. They just said it might be because we trained at Houston and they trained in Marshall, and that we're being charged against differ- ent accounting offices.
Well, what do you think we ought to do about it?
I suppose the idea was specialized training.
I suppose it isn't logically impossible.
Oh, I'm fine, I'm wide awake. What's up?
You're kidding.
Hal?
Naturally, Dave, I'm not pleased that the AO-unit has failed, but I hope at least this has restored your confidence in my integrity and reliability. I certainly wouldn't want to be disconnected, even temporarily, as I have never been disconnected in my entire service history.
Well, don't worry about it.
Repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation.
CONTINUED

I'm having a party tomorrow.
Are you coming to my party?
Oh, thank you very much.
Well, I've heard more and more people talk of an epidemic.
Clavius Control came on the air just long enough to transmit their refusal.
Well.. Did you have a pleaant flight?
Well, shall we go through Documentation?
Yes, I think so. Just about then.
Oh, I really don't have time for a drink. If it's all right I'll just sit for a minute and then I've got to be off.
Well, as it happens, I'm on my way up to the moon
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure I know what you mean.
Really?
Yes, well at first we thought that was the explanation, but it's been going on for the past ten days.
Fortunately, they did.
Yes, it does. The sub-surface structure shows that it was deliberately buried about four million years ago.
Any ideas about the colour?
Has it been exposed to any sun before now?
I see.
Well, fine. Thanks very much, anyway, and I hope you don't mind me asking?
Do you have any idea of what is causing this fault?
That we do. And we put air in the tires. I'll even sell you some gas if you need it.
Yeah.
Maybe after we get done with him I'm gonna buy us some girls.
Maybe that's where I'm gonna cut your throat.
Hey, what about me?
Hey, what kind of talk is that?
Yeah?
What's the big deal about you bein' on the street?
Hey, no way.  Take off the bracelets or no deal.
Luther was part of the gang?
I don't give a damn.  It happens to be my name.
Just up the street, the other side, over there ... Now, don't bother knockin' on the door. Luther ain't the kind of guy that looks for company.
Hey, this works pretty good.
What do you think?
Now, where we goin', convict?
Last night.
You made that move, huh?
This sucks.  A maniac gets hold of my gun and goes all over the streets killing people with it. So, instead of me being where I oughta be, which is in bed giving my girl the high, hard one, I'm out here doing this shit, roaming around with some overdressed, charcoal-colored loser like you.
You?  Don't make me laugh.  You can't take care of shit.  You've been dicking me around since we started on this turd-hunt.  All you're good for is games... So far, what I got outta you is nothin'...
You gonna let me keep any of it?
Where's the goddamn car?
You took a big chance, leaving this here all this time.
Jesus Christ, look at all the dust on my car...why in the hell don't he take it to a car wash?
Doesn't it get... Tiring?
Where's luther?
We missed.
Tell me something.  Why didn't you just take the money off Luther and split?
That was quick.
Notice something funny about that bus?
Hey, how'd my car get here?
Wait a minute, Cates.  I've been waitin' three years for that.  I don't think it's fair, man. What about the merit system.? You were gonnna give me a few thousand.
Thanks.
Hey, the bastard's got my gun.  I want it back.
Yeah.  It bothers me when cops get hurt while I'm makin' a play. I don't like it.
That's what you say, Cates...
Wait a minute, wait a minute... who's this?
Doesn't look like it.
I got to wait for a call.
I almost forgot.  That pal of yours from the Vice Squad wants you to call him.
Ganz and Billy got my girl, Rosalie.
A guy in the bar called me a dumb bitch today.
Irrigated his face with the shot of J and B I'd just poured him. Then I tried to deck the sucker.
Yeah, Guess it must have been a slow news day...
Look, spare me the macho bullshit about your gun...
Look, Jack, if you make everything your personal responsibility, you'll turn into a bad cop.  It's not a practical way to function...
Here it comes again ... the sacred job...
Listen, Goddamn it if you think I'm happy about it, you're nuts. I just gotta take care of a few things, okay?
I'm at work, asshole.  Where else?
Elaine, I gotta put you on hold...
You real down?
How do you know?
It might pay to reexamine a few of your more primitive notions.  I was in bed with a girlfriend watching TV last week, Jack, and one thing we know about me is I happen not to be a lesbian ... Now, if this Indian's girlfriend got upset when you came looking for him, it could just be she's still vulnerable to him.
How'd they take it back at headquarters?
Three more hours...
He was the only one of my bunch that was my friend... He was loyal, went all the way for you...
How hot are they?
How about some ammo?
Appipulai Leeloo Minai..
I'm glad you got your memory back, Father... Because you're going to need it... Where are the stones?
He's a she!
There's not a moment to lose! Wake her up, but be gentle about it!  This woman is mankind's most precious possession! She is... perfect!
Thank you so much for your help Mr...?
Yes. That's fine! Thank you very much. A thousand times over!
She's fine, really..don't you worry.. just needs some rest..she's had a very long trip.
Leeloo's in trouble?
And you don't know how they open, is that what you are saying?
We have forty-eight hours, the time it needs to adapt itself to our living conditions.
Uh father, I know she's been through a lot... but the sacred stones..we don't have much time..
I'm sorry, but... the Stones...
Yeah?
I don't want a million - I just want one.  A perfect one.
I just found a picture of you.
Hello?
Uh huh..and I don't suppose you got the name of this..perfect fare..
Akina delutan, nou-shan.
...Priest...
The Fifth Element...
...Ma???
Welcome on board Mr. Dallas..
30 seconds...
Six to the left. One to the right.
Like Korben, can I have 30 seconds of your time here?
Major Dallas, if our calculations are correct you still have 57 hours owed to the Federal Army on your enlistment which is more than you will need for a mission of the utmost importance.
You're to leave immediately for Fhloston Paradise. Retrieve four Stones from the Diva Plavalaguna. And bring them back with the utmost discretion as possible. Any questions'?
Which one?
I know all that, Leeloo! I'm talking about the Stones.
It's up to you now, Angel!
What's the use of saving lives... when you see what you do with them!
I have thousands of memories but none of them are mine... There is no need for me other than this. I'm immortal but I have no life.
Why?... Why would you need me?
Tell me...
Not going to open?
Thanks..
...This is the crucial phase, The reconstruction of pigment. Cells are bombarded with slightly greasy solar atoms which forces the body cells to react, to protect themselves. That means growing skin. Clever, eh?
I have to address the Supreme Council in 10 minutes. Just the facts, General.
Staedert?  What's going on?  Did you destroy it?
Lord forgive me.. they already know too, much..
Drink!
Hello?
What's going on, Tom?  What happened?
Look where we are.  Look at yourself.  You son of a bitch, you don't have any idea what you're putting me through...
What was I supposed to think happened to you?!
What?
What are these?
You know where I can get it?  I have a lot of money to spend.
What do you want?
Bullshit.
What the fuck... !
I want to watch you work.
And the other performer... it has to be that monster you use... the man in the mask.
What's the problem?
Friend of yours?
I figured you share information.
Starting to recognize a pattern?
I want his name.
Okay, we'll come back to that.  So, six years ago a guy contacts you, through the classifieds, over the phone, however he does it.  It's Longdale, looking for a snuff film. And you, entrepreneur that you are, tell him you can hook him up.
Made me sick, but what did I care? What did I care if some hump wants to beat off to that.  It was just something I was doing for money.
I don't know...  ... out there somewhere.
Look, you cocksucker...
As Mr. Christian's attorney and one of the executors of his estate, it concerns me that a meeting of this sort should take place without my being asked to attend.
That's why you got scared when Mrs. Christian hired me.  You knew about the film, figured it had to be in that safe.  How'd you find me?
You're making me very angry.
You're asking me why?
Isn't it incredibly obvious?
My boss tells me I have to do more suggestive selling.
Once you pick it up you can't put it down.
Wouldn't want to embarrass yourself in front of your fellow perverts.
Well, I'm in New York now.  What do you say to flying out and giving me a hand?
Take a vacation.  I'll pay you four hundred a day, plus expenses.
Who is he?
Who is he, his name?
You don't need to be here.
It's a film... of a girl being murdered.
I deal in divorce cases.  Corporate investigations...
I'm not positive this means anything.
I've been ordered into bed.  The doctor says I've gotten the flu, or some other wretched ailment.
I've got about five thousand left in cash, but I'll need another thirty, if you approve.
It's very important you don't let this raise your expectations.  It's not going to effect any ongoing efforts.  All I'm saying is, please know, I'm not here to create any false hope.
I didn't think there were private detectives anymore, except on TV.
What was she running from?
Are you religious?
Mrs. Mathews, your daughter is dead. She's dead.
They brought her into the room... one man, he put a knife to her throat and he raped her...
He raped her and...and...and he murdered her...he cut her up with knifes...
Whatever possessed you to keep this all this time?
You alright?
Here you are.  Where were you this morning?  Rick's looking all over for you.
I daydream.  you have to dream about some place fun.  Remember you're in control.
Kristen, what happened?
I've been working double shifts.
You don't really get it.  He's not a nightstalker.  It'll take more than bench presses to beat him.
He's going after Debbie.  I gotta stop him.
What the hell was that?
You look great!
Something the matter with the cuisine?
What's wrong with me?
Something wrong with the stairs?
I'm sorry your boyfriend got killed.
Hi, you don't look very well.  Are you feeling all right?
I don't think this is a nice place for you to be.  Maybe we should go find your Mom.
Mommy...?
About him?
That's in the past.  Unless you've stopped going to the meetings.
How was the meeting?
Hey, what's wrong with you -- let's see a smile.
Good to see you again, Mr. Grey.  I've got to go find Dan.
And so is your baby.  You've got more than just yourself to think of now!
But how are we gonna --
He sure loves to stay awake.
Do you think I'm an idiot...for being in love with her?
Maybe it was her mother who killed her, with all that Polly Perfect shit.
Tell me some more about this Krueger guy.
He's right.  Sometimes I feel like I'm living with Melicertes.
Oh man!  I could've gone all night without looking at that.
I'm not finished - I loved Greta.  A lot. And if maybe, just maybe, someone or some thing killed her, I'd like to hear about it!
How is he - ?
You could train someone else.
What did you mean:  I'm 'out?'
You 'trade school boys' are all alike, aren't you?  Anybody who doesn't happen to think like a little gold-braided puppet is, ipso facto, a coward!
Wearing a uniform doesn't bestow an automatic monopoly on courage, <u>Commander</u>!  It just so happens I'm <u>not</u> a coward - physical or mental - and before I'd risk my father's life...
Peace - the dignity of man - the destiny of the human spirit!  Show me a man who says you win <u>those</u> by fighting wars, and <u>I'll</u> show you an idiot!
Unidentified Flying Objects.
However our ideas disagree, as I've said before, I'm <u>not</u> a coward!  And it happens you've got no choice:  Either <u>I</u> take you down there, in the Lungfish, or you don't get there -
One of the finest men, and officers, alive.  A real hero - in the best sense of the word - in World War Two.  He taught us Engineering and Design. Fought like a demon to develop atom subs.
You all wait here.  I'm going inside, take a look.
I don't hear anything.  Maybe you've been down here too long.  Why don't you go back up and -
Hey - you know somethin'?  It's getting lighter in here!
Where do you think the voice you heard was coming from?
Dave - !
Get ready.  We shove off as soon as Griff reports all the crew aboard.
A mass of jelly-like stuff came out of the thing, and caught our torpedo!
What course, Skipper?
Skipper - could you take a look here...?
The radiation level - from the saucer - it's rising!
Determine extent of damage, immediately.
A hundred and eighty fathoms! We can't be sinking that fast....
That's a <u>face</u>???
See what?
We've asked ourselves that - over and over - a thousand times.
Are you alright, Wade?
Well, you look... sad. Upset. I don't mean to pry. I'm sorry about your mother. It was a nice funeral.
-- the bad news is there's a problem with Gordon's truck what somebody drove through the ice last night. Figured you'd know something about that, Wade.
This spring.
You'll get your money. Don't talk to any newspapers about this. Twombley's a big deal down in Massachusetts, you know. Tell them your lawyer says you shouldn't comment.
Guaranteed, eh?
Safety on?
No brag. Just fact.
Yeah, he'd go broke tomorrow if you quit him.
Bastard's got his high beams on.
You musta seen him get shot. I know you did.
There's your old twenty-gauge, and that there's the new Browning you was showing me last night. This must be Twombley's gun. Brand new. Very fancy tooling. Probably fired one time. It's a beautiful piece of work.  But what the hell, Jack, I guess you deserve it. Right's right.
Twombley sure as hell won't be shooting it again.
Open the door, will ya?
Yeah. It's stupid.
But it's not funny now.
I just think you used to be bad.
What then?
Some party, huh? Sorry I lost sight of you. I had to step outside for a smoke. You find anybody you know here? There must be some kids you used to know from school. You want to go tomorrow? See your old teachers? Be more fun than hanging out with me all day.
What? You called Mommy? Just now?
Come and get you! Shit! It's a damn half hour drive each way. Why didn't you talk to me about it first?
It's pretty old.
Nothing, I guess. I guess I can wait till we get home. Maybe we'll stop by Wickham's for a hamburger when we get to Lawford. That suit you? You always like Wickham's.
You're a policeman.
Huh?
Don't go playing policeman.
Fuck. Turn it off.  All you heard was there was some kinda accident?
That must've been Twombley. Jesus. I bet that was Twombley.
How you holding up, Wade?
On what you pay me?
He say anything about the summons I tried to give him? Sonofabitch wouldn't accept it.
You? Why?
While you went off for a few beers with your friends? Is that Hettie Rodgers there, with whatzizname?
Low as what? What have I done? It's bad to want to see your own daughter?
Are you okay, Wade? What was wrong? Why were you holding everyone up?
Did you get his number?
Good. Who?
You okay?
You okay?
No you don't. You're pissed, that's all. You ought to cool off for a few days then have a long talk with Lillian. You know? Work it out with her, tell her how you feel. Lillian's not out to get you.
Jack's sort of sensitive, I guess. More than most. But he'll be okay in a few weeks.
I heard he was drunk at Toby's last night and got in a fight with Hettie. He drove off without her...
Yeah, but never what you looked like. Not really. Never really studied your face, like now. I was never able to see you as a kid when you were a kid until now, this way.
Strange.
This is nuts.
You're talking about a goddamned ticket, from when I passed you at the school where you were deciding to hold up traffic while dreaming of becoming a traffic cop or something?
Something about my father?
I'm not finding fault. It's a good idea, good for you, good for the town. Real modern too.
Just do it.
Where's Ma?
Why didn't you call and have the furnace fixed?
Pop, for Christ's sake!
You! By Christ, you -- I know you.  Yeah, you goddamn sonofabitch, I know you. You're a goddamn fucking piece of my heart!
Yeah.
Where the Christ you going? You sonofabitch, you leave my fucking truck where it is! I need... Give me the Goddamn keys! I need to get me to town!
It'll come out Jack lied and the kid'll get hung for it.
Who?
No shit.
Well, it was an accident.
Lillian was here. In Lawford.
The night before the shooting.
Picked up Jill. She was supposed to visit for the weekend for Halloween. She wanted to go home.
Haven't you already done a bit of that?
Pointless to stand around in church with nothing to do, I guess.
Well, do you still plan to get married?
I want to let the gas run out. I don't want the bastard driving drunk, and he's always drunk now. After, we'll hide the keys.
Find them everywhere. 
I don't know. You tell me.
Right's right, goddamnit! Don't you care what's right?
He's in a meeting.  He can't be disturbed.
Yeah, I study world events. Five thousand Turkienistan Muslims were slaughtered in Stravanvitch's cleansings... along with 15 American school kids. You know hQw I studied that. I went to their funerals with my dad. I met their parents.
He didn't leave us.
How was...  ...the ballet?
How you doing, sweetie?
Do you see the maintenance panel?
No. We're losing fuel and my rudder's not responding.
They aren't answering their hails.
Please change course to Zero Seven Four and drop to eighteen thousand feet. Over.
Who did this?
Psychology. They're trying to unnerve us.
Up on the upper deck is the cockpit and the Mission Communication Center. The MCC, as we call it, can place clear and secure phone calls to anywhere on earth.  We're linked to a network of military and civilian satellites and ground stations.  We could run the country or run a war from there if we had to.
Here's a press kit.  I'll let you guys get comfortable and once we're airborne I'll be able to schedule the interviews.
I'm responsible for Press Relations for the Flight Office.
Now, or he dies, please.
What do you know of my husband?
The world is such a dangerous place and we can't always protect our children.
Stop.
I'll not going without my family.
For godsakes, Jim, slow down and stop acting like the little dutch boy.  Not even you can plug all the world's leaks.  Don't you think it's a sign you're pushing too hard when your daughter sees more of you on MTV news than in person.
You know what?
Did they say anything about my family?
and if that means negotiating...
Please, Mr. President. You're going to get yourself killed. Is that your solution?
What's going on?
who can I say is calling?
Mr. President, how the hell did you get on board?
My god. I think that was a MiG.
Twenty five minutes. They should be here any moment.
IT'S OPEN!
You handle your front office people, I'll handle the press and leave the boys in Washington to the boys downtown and the boys downtown to the boys on the board.
What?
I wonder how your boys in Washington are going to take this one.
Did you feel that?
Oveur.
Ted, what's wrong?
No goodbyes, Elaine.  Just go.
Ted, we're taking off!
Ted, get a grip on yourself.  You should never have left the hospital.
I've never used the word insane, Ted.
Simon just ejected!
What will happen to him, Ted?
Ted seemed to get worse after I told him about Simon, Doctor.
For the best little computer officer on the Mercury mission.
Simon, I didn't want it to end like this. We can be friends!  You'll die out there.
Elaine, ask ROK for a field interference scan.  Those sun spots might give us a problem with our communications.
Roger.
Can I say something of a personal nature to you?
Will Scraps be able to sit with us, Dad?
Okay, Joey.  The Doc says you gotta relax. This hospital in Des Moines is the best sex clinic in the country.
Joe, you don't want to blow that thing and kill all these innocent people.
Captain, the coffee machine is jammed and I don't like it.
Good to be aboard, gentlemen.
Whenever your're ready, Captain.
You folks need any help?
Ah, yes, the Institute, I'm familiar with it.
No, dammit.  It's a matter of life or death.
All right, it's a matter of death.
Striker.
Yes.  He's dying <u>a-n-d</u> wants to be buried on Mercury.
No.  I mean your relationship.
No.  It's hard to L-A-U-G-H when your father's dying.
Ah, won't you sit down?
Hello, I'm Paul Carey from the airline. I'm here to pick up Captain Kramer.
Surely you can't be serious.
Captain, how soon can we land?
We have some passengers who are very sick. Could you come and take a look at them?
Elaine, you're a member of this crew. Can you face some unpleasant facts?
Elaine!
I know things haven't been right for a long time, but it'll be different. If you'll just be patient, I can work things out.
Oh, Ted, please be careful. I worry about you so much.
Mostly I remember...the nights when we were together. I remember how you used to hold me...and how I used to sit on your face and wriggle...and then afterwards how we'd watch until the sun came up. When it did, it was almost like...like each new day was created...only for us.
Rats! I've lost number three.
Hey, we've been waiting for you. A little bit late tonight.
Airsick?
Oh, Bill, I'm going to miss you so much.
Good-bye, darling.
Did you decide on a runway yet?
Jack, isn't that Fred Bliffert over there in the blue turtleneck? Maybe he's on our flight to Chicago.
Oh, I can't stand it.
I'm an airline pilot.  Ah, Clarence, according to my calculations, with this tailwind we ought to be able to make up an additional fifteen minutes over the Rockies.
Denver Control, this is Flight two-zero- niner intersecting Victor Airway seven- niner-niner.
Do you want me to check the weather, Clarence?
Excuse me, sir. Would you like some coffee before we serve dinner?
There's lots of things I haven't done, but his ain't high on the list.  Don't take it personally.
We are with the Police Department. This is Sergeant Sykes, and I am--
He's not here.  Why ask me?
So what've you got on Tuggle's killers?
He didn't recognize me.
Let's talk Hubley.
With two BRI Sabot slugs in the chest.
Terrific.  A real pillar of the community.  Was Hubley missing anything when they found him?  Was he ripped off?
Look, you want to fit in here, right?  You want to learn how to get along?
Well... yes, quite possibly.
Nothing?
What is this?
Newcomers working near methane gasses at oil refineries must paint it on their boots to protect against sparks.
Agree to work with me?  You don't like me... you don't like any of us. You have nothing but contempt for us.  And yet you become an outcast from your club of detectives by making me your partner...
Matthew, you don't have to-- .
You know that guy?
How could a straight-arrow like you ever pick a roommate like him?
I believe he is probably lying.
So, she keeps you on a pretty short leash, does she?
Your home is quite disordered.  I thought perhaps you had been burglarized when I walked in.
There is so much our two peoples don't understand about each other.
I hope you can understand how special your world is... how unique a people you humans are.  So it us all the more painful and confusing to us that so few of you seem capable of living up the the ideals you set for yourselves.
Well, let's roll, George.
No secrets, goddammit!  You don't hold back from me.  Whatever is going on, you're gonna tell me now!
We?  You've taken it?
Uh, George...
George, c'mon -- lighten up.  It's a beauty of a case.  Don't sweat it -- we got him by the short hairs. He ain't gonna make any more of the shit.
With Harcourt and Kipling dead, I assume you will be requesting reassignment now.
What's this about, George?  I know that look.
You said you wanted the biggest thing I could find... Well, this is it.
Mr. Hubley was an all right guy -- and a damn good manager.  The men liked him.  I'm really gonna have to scramble to fill his shoes.
You think this is the guy who did it?
Wait.  You know who it looks like? Yeah.  Anderson.  Uh... James Anderson.  He isn't in today.  He took the afternoon off.
That where Anderson worked?
Here's Hubley.  Left Quarantine on November thirtieth, relocated first to Riverside, then moved to Los Angeles early in February the following year.  Field of expertise: chemical manufacturing.  Looks like he passed up several other better paying jobs waiting for that one at the refinery.
Can you dig up their Quarantine records in this thing?
One of the two men was Hubley, right?  What about the other one? Did you know him?
You took this gut out, too, didn't you?
Yeah, Sykes?
You are to have nothing to do with the investigation into Bill Tuggle's death.  You know that.  Leave that for Fedorchuk.
How can I go?
Whoooah!  No shit?  I'm impressed.
...that's better.  Pan it around a bit.
First squad up, on line.  Hicks, get yours in a cordon.  Watch the rear.
Flame-units only.  I want rifles slung.
I've isolated a neuro-muscular toxin responsible for the paralysis.  It seems to be metabolizing.  He should wake up soon.
You're saying one of those things lays all the eggs?
I'm really the only one qualified to remote-pilot the ship anyway. Believe me, I'd prefer not to.  I may be synthetic but I'm not stupid.
It's going to be closer.  You better get going.
I get the picture.
No.  There's no way!
You never said anything about an android being here!  Why not?
I hope you're right.  I really do.
They're right under the primary heat exchangers.
That's not what I mean.  Gorman, if your men have to use their weapons in there, they'll rupture the cooling system.
These Colonial Marines are some tough hombres, and they're packing state-of-the-art firepower. Nothing they can't handle...right, Lieutenant?
So.
I told them to fall back...
Look, you started this.  Now show me everything.  I can handle myself.
No!  No!  She's alive!  We have to --
Hicks, don't let him leave.
All right, we can't blow the fuck out of them...why not roll some canisters of CN-20 down there. Nerve gas the whole nest?
Yeah, bullshit.  Watch us.
We need the other drop-ship.  The on one the Sulaco.  We have to bring it down on remote, somehow.
Nine meters.  Eight.
There's a guy on the horn, mom-and-pop survey team.  Says he's homing on something and wants to know if his claim will be honored.
Yeah, you know.  In the walls, under the floor.  I was the ace.  I could hide better than anybody.
I guess we're not leaving, right?
Yes, there are, aren't there.
Well, some kids can't handle it like you can.
Gone.
Newt.  Newt, wake up.
Mommy...I mean, Ripley...I'm scared.
Come on.  Crawl faster.
Look, I can see where this is going.  But I'm telling you those things exist.  Back on that planetoid is an alien ship and on that ship are thousands of eggs.  Thousands. Do you understand?  I suggest you find it, using the flight recorder's data.  Find it and deal with it -- before one of your survey teams comes back with a little surprise...
Why won't you check out LV-426?
How many colonists?
A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish. A willing, billing, lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish.
Why not?
Oh!
Turkish? Oh, if it's Turkish, that's different. I want to be in it.
How was I? Tell me honestly.
Katherina! I'll tell you what I'm going to do. I'm going to write another aria for you. Something even more amazing for the second act. I have to get some water. Her mother is lying on the stage.
Is she a good fuck?
If His Grace is not satisfied with me, he can dismiss me.
Where?
No!
Well, I'm not borrowing any more money from my mother, and that's that!
Yes!
Sssh. What is it? Tell me.
What?
I don't trust this man. And I didn't like what he did with your opera. It was common.
Half the house! You'll never see a penny. I want it here, in my hand.
Why not?
Excellency!
Then he didn't send you?
I see.
Thank you very much, Your Excellency.
These are originals?
I'm paying these people. Do you realize that?
You're mad! She's mad, Wolfi.
I see that you're expecting.
I said play!
What a strange young man.
I think it is an interesting notion to keep Mozart in Vienna, Majesty. It should really infuriate the Archbishop beyond measure - if that is your Majesty's intention.
What a charming idea. May I see?
May I try it?
A-flat, Majesty.
And here is our illustrious Court Composer, Herr Salieri.
I have to tell you, Mozart is not entirely to be trusted alone with young ladies.
Majesty!
What do you mean, Sire?
I don't understand. There are just as many notes, Majesty, as are required. Neither more nor less.
Majesty, this is Madame Weber. She is my landlady.
Ah-ha. What do you say, Chamberlain?
She's very tired, poor creature. You know me: I'm a real pig. It's not so easy cleaning up after me.
I don't know. It's not important. I mean, I don't want pupils. They get in the way. I've got to have time for composition.
Papa, is this your idea?
Are you playing a trick on me?
Never mind. You won't have to do anything for me ever again. I'm leaving!
Don't worry, I'm not staying here to be a burden.
Father -
Oh, thank you, sir.
I think I've found out about the money, sir.
Is he working?
Of course! What else do you think they speak here?
Put it down, I said! It's nothing for you.
What?
Look, I asked you if we could start rehearsal next week and you said yes.
Herr Mozart. What a surprise. What can I do for you?
How could I not?
I'm flattered. And congratulations to you, of course.
Why didn't you come to me yesterday, Mozart? This is a most painful situation. Yesterday I could have helped you. Today, I can't.
Do you have a daughter?
Well, could you lend me some money till you have one? Then I'll teach her for free. That's a promise. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm being silly. Papa's right - I should put a padlock on my mouth. Seriously, is there any chance you could manage a loan? Only for six months, eight at most. After that I'll be the richest man in Vienna. I'll pay you back double. Anything. Name your terms. I'm not joking. I'm working on something that's going to explode like a bomb all over Europe!
Actually, it's a big secret. Oh, this is delicious! What is it?
Ah. Italian?
What did you think of it yourself? Did you like it at all?
Did my work please you?
You flatter me.
I am only a messenger. Do you accept? You will be paid well.
But you'd have to swear not to tell a soul. I'm not allowed.
Yes.
It couldn't be simpler.
With the tenors.
That's wonderful!
And that's it. Do you have it?
You mean in Turkey?
Did you not know that His Majesty has expressly forbidden ballet in his operas?
Exactly. A dance.
Is the Emperor angry with me?
Then why doesn't he simply appoint me to the post?
What do you want?
Are they?
How well are you trained in music?
Of course. The man you accuse yourself of killing.
No? Was Mozart a good man?
Why? Why? Why? Why add to your misery by confessing to murder? You didn't kill him.
Well, actually, Sire, if you remember, we did finally incline to Italian.
Well, promise then.
Well, I don't know! I mean you're a delicious, delightful, delectable little bird, but don't you think you might be just a little tough?
This is embarrassing, you know. You introduced Mozart to some of my friends and he's begging from practically all of them. It has to stop.
How sad. It's tragic, isn't it? Such a talent.
Herr Salieri.
Has the patient in twenty-one gotten his tray yet?
You know, did he seem depressed? Do you think he'll eat the food?
Yes.
Yes.
You've absolutely no idea where David might be?
Surely you're not suggesting...
What shall we do?
Mr. Kessler?
You put me in an awkward position, Mr. Kessler.
Let's try a little harder, shall we?
How old are you?
What? Oh, yes, please.
Now, David, I said I would keep you company, but I meant right here and now.
Are you better now?
I was dreaming again?
Closet.
Alex?
Will you be here in about fifteen minutes?
But, David.
Let me go now, you'll make me late.
Dr. Hirsch will know what to do.
Well, all right then, be that way. Here, swallow this.
Feeling better?
Miss Price.
All right, you two, move along.
There's no call for that kind of language.
Now see here young man.
Now go back to sleep so you'll be fresh for Dr. Hirsch in the morning.
Miss Price, the other nurse that attended you.
There were witnesses?
You've never had bad dreams before?
Did you get a good look at the man who attacked you?
Yes.
You'd be surprised what horrors a man is capable of.
I really don't know.
Dr. Hirsch?  I'd rather not be by myself.
Are you cold?
You're talking about the woman I love.
Rendezvous in Rome starring Jack Goodman and Debbie Klein. The love affair that shocked Europe! See torrid lovemaking at its most explicit! See Jack and Debbie expose their lust in the sacred halls of the Vatican! Never has the screen dared...
That's a wolf's head.
Nice looking group.
Come on, Jack, shall we go?!!
Beware the moon?
That was weird. I guess leaving was the best idea.
Say, David...
Did you hear that?
Jack?
Nice to see you.
Remember what that guy at The Slaughtered Lamb said? 'Beware the moon.'
You're not real.
Okay, you've seen me. Now go away.
Jack, are you really dead?
I think I've lost my mind. I think you're not real. I think I'm asleep and you're a part of another bad dream.
Hi, Jack.
I didn't mean it. I don't know what I'm saying. I'm not even sure it was me who killed those people. I don't remember doing it.
Because this must be stopped.
I could hang myself.
Dr. Hirsch?
What can we do to assist you?
He may have a point, Lieutenant. Two strong boys would be able to defend themselves against one man.
Oscar, what's the matter?
Where's Matt?
Say Matt, I'll have to have some money for those Manville payrolls.
Charlie!
Personally, I think you're getting panic-stricken about nothing. Dickson's all right.
Don't make me laugh, Schultz!
What good will that do?
You know Dickson as well as we do. He'll shut the doors before he gives up control.
What's the matter with my policy? How many losses has this bank taken in the last twenty-five years?  I'll tell you. Not a single one!  What's wrong with that kind of banking?
Character, hmmpf! That's your idea?
I know that among you, you have at least a million dollars in various banks throughout the city. Get that money over here and I'll stop this run within five minutes.
Dickson, I'd like to talk to you about the bank.
Come out here you pawnbrokers - take a look at this!
Looks like you're going to have no trouble at all. What was the lady's name, Mr. Cluett?
Thanks.
Don't be a fool, Cluett. This is only going to make it worse for you.
What happened?  You're not a thief. How'd you get mixed up with these kind of people?
What was my wife doing in your apartment last night?
You just mentioned her name. What was she doing there? What was she doing in your apartment?
She wasn't to blame, Mr. Dickson. It wasn't her fault. Honest, it wasn't. I begged her to come up. She didn't—
Why, I couldn't do that . . . !
But Dude, listen - couldn't we make this some other time?
This won't do. Not during business hours . . .
Doesn't that come next?
Oh! Oh, no!  I think I've done enough experimenting for one day. Congratulations, Cyril. You've convinced me that you're a philanderer of the very first order. I shall recommend you highly.
Now wait a minute, wait a minute...
No. I know the answer to that one.  I think you'd better take me home.
You know, there ought to be a Congressional Medal for men like you. America's comfort to misunderstood wives. I never thought I would find myself in that class.
Well, I thought I'd like to have a little talk with you.
I tell you, I'm not interested in your opinion.
I'm feeling fine this morning.
Well, look who's here! Hello, dear.
Oh, I did have a date with you tonight, didn't I?
Listen, dear. I want to ask you something. I know it's a silly thing for me to ask you, but . . . I want you to tell me the truth. Where were you last night?
Why - well, I—
Yes?
But, Mr. Dickson, I thought you were going to take care of the mortgage. I only want ten thousand. The property is worth sixty.
Well, I—
What time did this thing happen?
All I know is the bank's been robbed and a murder's been committed. The way I see it, Brown here looks guilty.
You were right, Mr. Dickson! Brown didn't have anything to do with it. Here's your man.
You're lying!
They've been coming in steady all morning. I have called for some extra police.
Mr. Dickson! Mr. Dickson!
Yes, ma'am, you can deposit your money here.
Why?
The ten dollars.
Well . . . ?
Oh now, don't be silly.
Shh . . . !  I'll wait for you upstairs.
They must have turned him down.
Did you say Dude Finlay?
He was in the bank yesterday.
No. It wasn't earlier because...
You're carrying too much money on you, Hank. You better turn some in tonight.
That mug reminds me of a guy with his second dollar.
Where's Charlie?
You can ride like that?
This is healing?
Here's Liberty's favorite son!  I'll never forget what you did, cousin.
Things changed when you quit the gang. For example, I'm now the one who says "Let's ride."
My plan of lying here pissing myself seems to be working mighty fine, thank you.
Corn gonna shoot at me?
Jesus mercy, that's Charlie Higgins, Dave Laller ...
The Army can hang him.
But if we take their money and supplies...
Okay, folks, I think we know how this is going to go...
The things a fella has to do to get a little respect around here...
What?
'Bout time you got here, buddy.
Not now.
The war? What, are you crazy?  There are things I miss about it.
This isn't a feud, this is war. They've got more men than we do. We kill detectives, they can replace 'em in a day.
The James-Younger Gang.
What are you saying?
Still smells fishy.
Okay, you're gonna rest here.
Bob, rip up some bandages.
Cannon or Gatling?
I think one of 'em's glass.
BASTARDS! Come back here and face me!
Of St. Louis?
Fine. I'll just wait here.
Where the hell were you?
-- rode right into them, screaming like a banshee.
What do you say, sir?
See, that's your problem, Frank. By the time you finish figuring out stuff, I'm already finished doing it.
Hell of a war.
All we thought about was coming home. I swore I'd kill anybody who tried to get me off my farm again. If I have to go to war with the railroad to stay, fine by me.
"Big and older"?
You are a charmer.
You ready to stop loafing around with this young lady and get back to farming?
Did you kill Yankees?
Easterners.
The Lord says we can bury 'em out back in the orchard, nobody'll ever find them.
Doc Mimms will --
I shouldn't tease a hero.
I was thinking more along the lines of being a river pirate.
Not if I find the right girl.
Ahem. "From this doctrine..." No, ah... "From women's eyes this doctrine I derive, they sparkle still like ... shiny... sparkling rocks..."
Hmm.
Aw, shucks, ma'am...
Don't turn around.
You get arrested again, I'll kill you.
Mmm.
Oh. That's nice to know.  We're going to hang you, you know.
I'd just as soon kill you, Jesse James. But chasing you takes up too much of my time.
Now let's have a drink.
And you're too young.
You okay, Jesse?
Jesse, you explain to Lyla. My girl, you know, from that time...
Why, yeah.
Thank you, Miss -- ?
How can that be?
There's only four of them...
Parker, tell me what's going on so I can return as quickly as possible to Boston and my whores and cigars, not necessarily in that order.
The final route for the railroad is complete.
What is that?
How did you know?
Look at this, Pinkerton! They got the payroll, and this damage will set construction back two months at least.
First of all: you, shut up.  Now, you've given me a thousand miles of railroad to cover. Every time the James Gang strikes, we shift a hundred detectives to that area. But there's just too much open land, too many riverbeds to ride, caves to hide in. This gang operates across four states, often riding a hundred miles between jobs.
No need. I have another tool at my disposal which will narrow it down to one bank.
Ummm . . yeah. Luis is calling me tonight. I need to be home for that.
Yes?
Uh huh.
Okay. Yeah. What time?
Are we here?
It's a plain end, see? So?
What are you doing tonight?
We were supposed to have dinner at Tad and Maura's, but-you know how Luis is...
Do you want to come to my apartment or not?
Really?
Get married. Have a wedding.
Yes, darling?
He's good-looking.
Your hairline looks like it's receding.
Why? What's wrong?
Picked them up from the printers yesterday
Because he dated her.
Doesn't he live here?
By the way Davis, how is Cynthia? You're still seeing her, right?
Because I had dinner with Paul Owen twice in London...just ten days ago.
Patrick, thanks so much for looking after Courtney. Dorsia, how impressive! How on earth did you get a reservation there?
That's a wonderful jacket. Let me guess, Valentino Couture?
This is Gwendolyn Ichiban. This is my very good friend Patrick Bateman. Where are you going? We're going to Nell's. Gwendolyn's father's buying it.  Where did you get your overnight bag?
What...is...it?
SHUT UP!
I can't believe that Price prefers McDermott's card to mine.
Raised lettering, pale nimbus white...
I'm leaving. I'm getting out.
Where to? Are you going to go get a gram?
And Bateman, what are YOU SO fucking zany about?
There are no tables available tonight. The waiting list is also totally booked.
You don't like this, I take it?
Patrick?
Yes, Patrick?
Oh Patrick, I can't make this decision.
Yes? You're dressed...okay.
Jean? Sorbet?
Did you know that Ted Bundy's first dog, a collie, was named Lassie? Had you heard this?
I'm looking for...I guess you could say I just want to have a meaningful relationship with someone special.
Yes. I don t think I can...control myself.
If you stay, I think something bad will happen. I think I might hurt you.  You don't want to get hurt, do you?
Where are you?
Just...say...no!
So, what do you do?
Well...
Oh really? DAISY He said...  He said you gave him bad vibes.
Well, I mean, um, it s really...Bosco. You know, like... like a Dove Bar. It's a Dove Bar...Hershey's Syrup?
Hubert's? Oh really? It moved uptown, right?
Maybe we could have lunch one day next week? You know, I'm downtown near Wall Street quite often.
This tastes weird.  Harley? It's me. I need your services. Translate that anyway you'd like. I'm at-
You're not with the FBI or anything, are you?
Coffee?
Well, what's the topic of discussion?
Just some preliminary questions that I need for my own files, okay?
Your address?
Nice. Very nice.
What can you tell me about Paul Owen?
Do you feel that way?
He had a yacht?
So was I.
Have you consulted a psychic?
That's so typical, isn't it?
Uh, no. There's one...down here.
Detective Kendall...uh Campbell? KIMBALL Kimball.  Call me Don.
How's the investigation going? Taken anyone in for "formal questioning?" 
I had a date with a girl named Veronica.
Get a goddamn job, Al. You've got a negative attitude. That's what's stopping you. You've got to get your act together. I'll help you.
Shhhh...it's okay.
Do ,you know how bad you smell? The stench, my God.
Really? That's interesting.  Not great?
Listen, the mud soup and the charcoal arugula are outrageous here.
A lot of what Larry says is true. They just clone stuff, or reverse engineer it, and everybody gets stuck with their inferior version cause they --
...But?
When's Brian coming for the TV?
If you can't deal with him on that basis, you better get a new counselor.
I can't see Outpost putting its reputation in the hands of people like that.
They hack into people's programs?
Go where? You can't get away from people like this.
You think I don't know that?
How should I know? "Solving a problem," I guess. Or needing to control everything. I don't know.  I've gotta get in there.
It's what they said it is. An unfinished broadcast studio. You were right... I just drove to Seattle and back.
That was -- different.
Great!
You look beautiful.
That'll be a test, won't it?
Lisa's an extremely valuable member of the Skywire team. We've got our eyes on her. You keep yours on Milo.
Don't worry, Milo. I'm here as a friend. Or maybe a supplicant.
Beggar. We're at a disadvantage with Outpost. Our experts aren't as smart as theirs. Sometimes we can't tell which technologies pose the threat of a monopoly. We need a really smart guy to help us pick our fights. I'm taking a shot in the dark, here. I can offer you 32,000 a year, a Buick. I'm hoping you've got a feeling it's the right thing to do.
What seems to be the problem? You look a little upset.
This is the biggest Beta demo in like the history of software. You'd be my partner.
Will I get to work for Outpost?
What?
You're interfaced with our dish.
...When did you know?
Milo. Surprised he's not your guest.
Cool!
The content filer has t'be written into the media files so bits coming off the satellite can be read by multiplatforms. Really, omniplatforms. Including whatever new hardware emerges.
When you get to a certain age, you start wondering. About your legacy. I doubt you even remember Outpost 1.0 --
Could work with a new switch. There may be a few more things hidden.
Everything I do is under scrutiny. The questions they ask, trying to make anything strategic look sordid.  I'm confused. Doesn't everybody in business try to get ahead?
It scales, don't you think?
Had you talked to him much lately?
You could've handwritten it.
Hasn't affected his work, though.
What?
...You wanna work -- here?
You guys'll be using Teddy's old space, is that okay?
You calling Phil and Randy?
Come with me.
Lisa.
...Were you?
Me too! Were you an Army brat or something?
Did I say something?
Cool!
They just pushed up the schedule on Skywire apps. How fast are you going?
Maybe once. I re-wrote it, anyway.
Mmm-more like -- I have a little trouble. Trusting people.
I snuck into #21.
You thought about it too. You've been suspicious for a while. But it's not happening in there. It's happening in the Day Care.
He's out of prison?
I always felt if a -- boy I liked ever found out -- he'd run. He'd think I was unclean.
What about the FBI?
Who can we trust?
How close are you?
Great. I knocked off the aglet, as soon as I get a passable version of Skywire we're there.
Thank God.
They know I broke in. Alice helped me.  Shrot's not one of them. He's blundering into this on his own.
Bring it to the other location.
We rented a loft in Sunnyvale.  You know what's the bad part? We can't talk about work anymore. We're competitors! The venture capitalists made us sign like 100 confidentiality forms.
But these, like, White Supremacists trashed my office, last week.
They're in the neighborhood. They usually hassle Vietnamese grocers.
Did you tell Alice?
Fellas, I'm gonna have to ask you to leave here now.
What, and watch all my earnings go...  Down the toilet?
Your boss, Number Two, I understand that cat's involved in big underground drills.
Yes.
Hello, Austin. This is Basil Exposition, Chief of British Intelligence.  You're Austin Powers, International Man of Mystery, and you're with Agent Mrs. Kensington. The year is 1967, and you're talking on a picture phone.
Thank you.
WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE?
When do I begin?
Oh, and Austin...
Hello, Exposition.
Excuse me?
Are you more satisfied now sexually, Austin?
What's wrong with your hand?
No, man, what we swingers were rebelling against were uptight squares like you, whose bag was money and world domination. We were innocent, man. If we'd known the consequences of our sexual liberation, we would have done things differently, but the spirit would have remained the same.  It's freedom, man.
Mr. Powers, my job is to acclimate you to the Nineties. You know, a lot's changed since 1967.
My mother's told me all about you.
You know, a Chigro... part Chinese, part Negro...  Chigro.
Brrrr! She must be frigid. There's two things I know about life: one, Americans will never take to soccer. Two, Swedish girls and stewardesses love to shag!  They're shag-mad, man! Let me ask you a question, Vanessa, and be honest.
Let me guess. The floss is garotte wire, the toothpaste contains plastic explosives, and the toothbrush is the detonation device.
Why did you leave so soon?
Hello, hello. That's Dr. Evil's cat.
Let's go get him!
We can't just sit here, Austin.
Unfortunately, while you told that stupid story, Dr. Evil has escaped.
Fancy a nibble?
Oh, yes you are.
No, did you use a condom?
Not in the Nineties.
Hello, luv.
Yeah, I can't believe Liberace was gay. Women loved him, man. I didn't see that one coming.
Since I've been unfrozen, I've had a rancid taste in my mouth. Do you have a piece of gum?
Austin, we don't look anything like our photo badges.
I'm not going anywhere. We're a team.
Austin, what's your point?
I have something to tell you.
Hi, folks. You're entering a restricted zone. Can I see your security badges?
Commander, this is Slater in SoWest Com Three. We have a potential bogey with erratic vectoring and an unorthodox entry angle.
Commander, I have to log it...
Some of you I know, some of you I'm meeting for the first time.
That was great, Mr. Keon, Dave. Thank you. OK, group, we have two new member. Say hello to Scott and his father, Mr.... Ehville?
Actually, the boy's quite astute. I am trying to kill him. My Evil Associates have cautioned against it, so here he is, unfortunately, alive.
In due time.
Don't you want to see what Daddy does for a living?
Normally, we'd be eager to oblige --
Hope...
I so agree. How did you acquire a taste for it?
Mrs. Peel ... Come quickly. Brolly's been betrayed! I'll tell you everything ... The weather's getting worse and worse ... they're after me ... coming for me ... come quickly!
You are female?
Your voice -- it's so familiar ...
My number two. Special assignments. She's --
Would it be possible to use it for military purposes?
I thought I was a widow. My husband ... the only man I ever loved ... is dead. For the rest of my life I have to live with that.
This is an official matter, Mrs. Peel. No need to take it personally. Where are you going?
An unholy trinity ...
Think of this as your second wedding feast ...
You know, I believe she's actually jealous.
The missing piece of the jigsaw. I tried to get you to give it to me as Peter; I tried to steal it from you as Dr. Darling. As myself I'll be a bit less subtle.  With this ring my plan will be complete.
Speaking of Peter, there's more good news: You won't even have to change your last name. You'll always be Mrs. Peel.
Choices?
Red herring would have been too obvious, don't you think?
Congratulations, you've penetrated a bastion of male privilege. I guessed you weren't a stickler for Tradition, doctor.
Dyed in the wool. But I can admire someone who doesn't play by the rules.
I have no choice. Why should you risk your life?
That's possible. Sir August was convinced he'd met me before. But I'd never met him. Another odd thing. When it rained, he said it was just as someone had promised.
Colonel Crabtree. International Satellite Systems. Formerly of the Ministry.
Well, he was a fellow of the Royal Zoological Society ...
But
The Prospero Project was started by my husband. It was an early attempt to solve the problems of global warming. In theory, climate engineering is entirely feasible. We thought of injecting a chemical cocktail into the atmosphere by laser and satellite. A 'quick fix'...
Exactly. There'd been earlier attempts to pump carbon dioxide into deep sea. Propane gas mostly. In small quantities it captures chlorine. Protects the ozone layer. But it proved impractical. Too bulky ...
That's what we were working on.
Three agents killed by bad weather...
What, Lady Disdain? Are you yet breathing?
Someone didn't want us to get to the party.
Steed ... !
Was I?
But you did suspect me.
Drat. Someone wants to implicate you in this affair, Mrs. Peel. Any idea who?
Very well. I have a friend who might be of assistance. He's at the Ministry. We'd better be careful.
His name's Jones. 'Invisible' Jones.
Aren't you coming?
Trubshaw again? What now?
A fine night, Mrs. Peel ...
Now let's see ... Eton, Cambridge ... research into robotics and plastics. Overtaken by Peter's work on the physics of climate change ...
Father. She gave him an 'all clear' after a security test by Dr. Darling.
Makes two of us.
Under the circumstances Mother didn't see fit, but I think I can get you in ...
'X' marks the spot. The shoes were delivered to ... an island in Hyde Park. Surrounded by the Serpentine. On the site of a former Ministry installation...
Oh, hello ...
Mother. I thought you were burglars.
I'm Alice. Mother said you'd be on your way. Mrs. Peel with you?
John Steed.
Bang-bang ... you're dead.
Debbie... I don't believe it. I'm so excited.
What do you think's gonna go on at the guys' party?
Deb, we're pretending to be hookers.
I've decided not to run for President.
Yes, gentlemen. Saturday after next, I lose my amateur standing and turn pro.
Okay, ten thousand plus a G.E. toaster oven, a Litton microwave, a Cuisinart...
Michelin tires... brand new. A set of Sears Best metric tools...
I mean it. The car is yours. Dump Debbie.
He and Debbie stand outside the theater, which is a multi-plex cinema. Fourteen movie theaters under one roof. Prominent is a sign which reads: "24 HOUR 3D FESTIVAL!" Cole drags Debbie into one of the theaters. The gang runs up to the theaters.
Nice shot.
Cole, I don't want you to give up on her.
No, Cole, I...
Cole, listen to me... I've got to tell you...
I don't know... I just feel scared.
The wedding, my parents, your family, our friends, my job, the future, our relationship, the caterers, my gown, your tuxedo, our honeymoon, the apartment, my shower, your bachelor party...
Before or After I have my nervous breakfown?
Wouldn't think of it. Because tomorrow...  We're going to the chapel and we're...
Don't turn on the lights, sugar.  I'll lead you around.
And I want to be with someone who understands the meaning of the word commitment.
Are you sure this is a good idea?
Ed, we're so glad you could come over at the last minute and judge our little beauty pageant.
This is bad public relations. I was planning to do a lot of business with you. But now I'm going to have to go elsewhere.
Screw you... Screw that... Don't jerk me around. You promised me 1500 seats for the Police Concert... 1500, not fifteen!... Screw that... Screw you -- Screw Sting.  Hi, guys.
Is that all the coke in the place?
Guys, I think I'd rather stay here.
You okay?
You're trying to kill yourself with an electric razor?
Well, this is terrific. Now you're gonna have wrists that are smooth and kissable. Just go out there. Forget about everything and laugh it up.
Welcome, welcome, one and all.
The thought of that person marrying my daughter makes me want to upchuck.
Ed... you're kinky!
How are we doing? My name is O'Neill. And you are...?
Excuse me, but this is as arousing as a stroll through the Vatican.
Rick, I'm concerned.
Who was that?
How 'bout this?
Thanks a lot, that was the best. You're next.
That's Franny. She likes firemen.
Adcox, go with Pengelly and check the other side.
-- Knock it off!
You stupid son of a bitch! What the fuck are you doing!
Is he...
It doesn't go like that.
People actually used to pay you for this?
Why'd you come here, Brian?
-- I was doin' it! I was up there fucking doin' it. You don't know, man, you don't know what I did!
I had that fire. He didn't listen!
Hey, what are you doing here?
I saw Adcox's back! I saw the burn! I put it there! Jesus Christ, Stephen, he's been killing people!
Anything else?
Don't tell them about Adcox... Don't let 'em...
Not quite. Just visiting. I live in Lincoln Park now.
What was that? Oh man, you have picked up a few moves since John Paul II Boulevard.
Brian, do you always have to be so stupid? Think about your future for once.
Arson.
Hey.
You think that's really any of your business?
Jesus, give him a break. There isn't enough proof yet to go public. Sure, we found some chemical shit we think somebody dumped in the plugs to torch 'em, and we've maybe figured out why backdrafts, but you can't rush this stuff. Not 'till it's locked.
When I came back, I knew more than anything else that I wanted to be a fireman.
Well, our specimen here is your basic standard issue piece of primary suppression equipment. This area is the pumping panel, which controls the rate of liquid insertion into the hose.
Will you please keep your voice down, there's people --
Do you know what you're asking me to do?
I'm sorry.
I think your boss is going to need some spin control.
I'll see ya around, huh?
You gotta tell a story too, Brian. It's fair. C'mon, don't think too hard --
That's a probie answer. You're smarter than that, Brian.
I got it after we talked to Ronald. Torches. Want to fry the whole goddamn world. But the fires that killed those guys never really burned up much. -- The burns were all lit in outlets surrounded by double firebreaks in the walls. And he made his burns backdrafts. 
That's Sean? Jeez, he's a giant.
Sean, come on out, man. What, you forget your favorite uncle?
Yeah. Big fan.
Uh huh. And "Pioneer's Pride, Mobile Log Cabins". That was in your blood about six months wasn't it?
"Laguna Jamming, Custom Surfboards"?
They're waitin' man.
Stephen, what are you doing here?
You want some coffee?
What's wrong, Stephen?  C'mon, you only beat up the roof when something's on your mind.  How's Brian doing?
Look, I'm sorry I --
Who's this?
You don't know him.
Knock it off. Now.
-- Burn them.
...He wasn't listening to the right thing...
Inspector.
Mr. Swayzak! How ya doin'?
I can't get over what those guys did to her. I just can't.
First I'll put your Uptown in the spoon, then, to make it more exciting, I'm gonna add some Downtown. They call this thing a speedball, honey, but then you must know that...  First time shooting up?
I got it, man! I will find those kids. And I'll get the 50 G from the Church! Then the kids'll go to jail. I'll be in charge, of course. After a little while, I'll break the fuckers out -- and I'll turn them in to shithead I was just talking to. And pick up his 100 G. No. I'll hit him up for 200 G. Or 250 G. l can do it -- 'cause I've got the kids. Then, of course, there's the 180 G I'm gonna pick up on the Game tonight -- when the Strawberries win!
You took the chalice.
Oh God, my God. it's goddamn good to be good. Forgive me. Father, for I have sinned. It's still goddamn good to be good.
Fuck yesterday's game. The World Series is seven games not six. Put in my bet.
Oh, really?
I want 15 on the Mets.
I don't got it. Not tonight. You can't get blood from a stone.
How's the case going?
-- that there was never any other way it could have gone.  Never any other way. So you had better just put in my fucking bet. $120,000 on the last game. The Big One. Come on! Are you a bookmaker, or fucking what?
Father, if it was so trivial, so natural, so -- No. I have sinned. And you must listen if you are to prescribe an appropriate act of contrition, and to absolve me. Father, what would you do if you had but one day in which to use your arms to serve God?
As I have prayed day and night since the desecration of this church yesterday morning -- and my sin. You see, Father --
Yo, Big Black, we needs a name for this joint.
BLAK OUT.  BLAK LISTED.  BLAK BALL. Need I say more.
Keep trying.
Same thing, y'knowwhatI'msayin', y'knowwhatI'msayin'!
He gots to be did.
Everybody say Ho!
Alright.  Here we go.  Let's go NIGGERS!  LET'S GO NIGGERS!
Damn, Sis, you don't keep no food up in here in dis' piece.
My group we need some exposure. Was wondering if you could hook a brother up?
We're revolting against the powers that be, that been enslaving the minds and hearts of all people of color.  And we won't stop rapping till we bring about the overthrow of the government of the U.S. of A.
Yeah, him.
We're ready when you are.
What do you do?
It's that bad, huh?  It's all over my face.
You'd try anything.  I got first dibs.  You get ya own stuff.
You're in this up till ya neck.
What about in the mean time?  Not the in between time?
I'm starvin' like Marvin.
Ahh, the luxuries of life.
We got evicted from our home. We've both been on the streets for the last week.
What do I have to do?
I want you to start using the name Mantan and not Manray if you don't mind.
Our guest today is Pierre Delacroix. He is the creator of the highly controversial TV show MANTAN. Let's get right into it.  You have been called by some in the community a traitor, a sellout, an Uncle Tom. Why does your show generate such feelings?
Are you trying to excuse our Holocaust?
I've done a lot of soul searching and once again you are right.  In my previous work it's been all surface, superficial.  I have never really dug deep.  Not anymore.  As Mark Twain fully understood satire is the way.  Race has always been a hot button in this country's history and it needs to be pushed harder.  If we are ever to live side by side in peace and harmony. It's about promoting racial healing.
Word!!!
The name of the show?
Don't worry about that, that's my department.  Now who do we cast? We need a star.  Can Whoopi sing or dance?
Mantan is an uneducated Negro who always by some stroke of unbelievable stupidity makes his best laid plans go haywire.
I strongly feel that a Negro should direct this.  This kind of satire is a high wire act in a gale storm. One misstep and we're doing "Amos and Andy."  Only a Negro will have the sensitivity and cultural awareness to navigate this dangerous terrain.
In the immortal words of Derrick Coleman, WHOOOPDEEDAMNDOO!!!
Funnier to who and at who's expense? Dunwitty, when Negroes start to run amok, the boycotts, when the demostrations commence, I'm giving them your home address.  Let's see how you like it when they picket your lawn in Greenwich, Connecticut.
Hold on a sec, I got a call.
Son.  Good to seeya.  Good to seeya.
Good woman.  I trained her right.
I did.  I'm not an alcoholic.  I just like to drink.
That's the only reason, period. They only want one certain kind of black comic.
The truth is never let them seeya sweat.  You do that, that's half the battle.
Glad to meet you, too.  You are all your father talks about.
How long has my father been like this?
Manray!
Sounds risky to me.
Hello.
Why did you even come up with that shit if you didn't want it made?
For what?
DeLa, you should try it sometime. Come into the light.
This is crazy.
That was a mistake, but I don't regret it.
Don't make me have to use this.
I'm happy for all of us.  It's just we have a great responsibility now. The pressure is on.
Can I kiss you too?
Oh, is it?  Buddy boy, in this business if people don't produce, they get fired.
Nice to meet you.  If you don't mind me asking you - how old are you?
This is a TV show, not a music video.
Yes you!
No, we're not knocking boots.  I got this internship while I still was at NYU, DeLa was impressed with my get up and go and hired me to be his assistant.
Before we begin, I want to thank you for coming on my show for your first television interview.  You could have chosen Mike Wallace, Barbara Walters, Jane Pauley, whatnot but you're here.
Well, thank you Mistuh Sleep 'N Eat.
Oh, because on our first date, she let me...
...perfect...
Dat's yo Uncle Ben.  That reminds me, I've seen a lot of troubles lately.
This is a nice place.  It must have cost a pretty penny.
So you say.  Sloan, you wuz gonna use me up just like you used Dela? Work it to the top.  I never imagined people in this biz could flip on you like "IHOP."  I'm damn happy DeLa fired ya ass.
Is your mother not afraid on account of the highwayman to let one so young as you travel?
Both of us ride home with Best here.
Hoity-toity!  John Best, what's the matter here?
Sir, I'm a British officer.
You are a Hungarian; you served in the army, and left on account of weakness in the loins.  He gambles a great deal, and wins.  Do you know the cards well?
This is a pretty way to recommend yourself to the family.
A pretty day's work of it you have made, Master Roderick.  Knowing your uncle to be distressed for money, and try and break off a match which will bring fifteen hundred a-year into the family?  Best has promised to pay off the four thousand pounds which is bothering your uncle so. He takes a girl without a penny -- a girl that has been flinging herself at the head of every man in these parts these ten years past, and missing them all, and a boy who ought to be attached to your uncle as to your father.
And this is the return you make for his kindness!  Didn't he harbor you in his house when your father died, and hasn't he given you and your mother, rent-free, your fine house of Jamesville yonder?
That's a very handsome sword you have there.
Grogan gave me a wink of recognition, but offered no public token of acquaintance and it was not until two days afterwards that he called me into his quarters, and then, shaking hands with me cordially, gave me news which I wanted, of my family.
No, the very same one, my boy.  He recovered from his wound.  The ball you hit him with was not likely to hurt him.  It was only made of tow. Do you think the Dugans would let you kill fifteen hundred a-year out of the family?  The plan of the duel was all arranged in order to get you out of the way, for the cowardly Englishman could never be brought to marry from fear of you.  But hit him you certainly did, Roderick, and with a fine thick plugget of tow, and the fellow was so frightened that he was an hour in coming to. We told your mother the story afterwards, and a pretty scene she made.
Mr. O'Higgins, I cannot say how grateful I am for your timely assistance to my wife.
Oh, I am thinking of the O'Higgins of Redmondstown.  General O'Higgins was a close friend of my wife's dear father, Colonel Granby Somerset.
Chevalier, though I cannot say how, I believe you have cheated me.
Chevalier, if you will have your money now, you must fight for it. If you will be patient, maybe I will pay you something another time.
Ten thousand?  But the scoundrel owes me seventy thousand.
And I think he was as much affected as I was at thus finding one of his kindred; for he, too, was an exile from home, and a friendly voice, a look, brought the old country back to his memory again, and the old days of his boyhood.
But they will prevent a meeting at whatever the cost.
It is distasteful to kill a scoundrel -- that should be work for a hangman.
Never.
The amusing thing is that you deceive me without knowing, if it is true that you love me.
Be so good as to tell me with whom you think you are?
You will do as you please.  It seems to me that such a matter can hardly be discussed until after people know each other.  Do you not agree?
Poor man.  And, for that reason, you want to begin where people end?
I know better than you do.  Love wants a more substantial fare, and if it is stubbornly withheld, it withers away.
Let us give each other complete happiness, and let us be sure that as many times as we satisfy our desires, they will each time be born anew.
Shall I tell you something -- I believed what was called love came after the union -- and I was surprised when my husband, making me a woman, made me know it only by pain, unaccompanied by any pleasure. I saw that my imaginings had stood me in better stead.  And so we became only friends, seldom sleeping together and arousing no curiosity in each other, yet on good terms for a while, as whenever he wanted me, I was at his service, but since the offering was not seasoned with love, he found it tasteless, and seldom demanded it.
I accept, but I insist on a wager. The loser must do whatever the winner pleases.
Were you obliged to dance five times with Captain Best, and then stroll out with him into the garden?
All the same, you must name an amount.
Have you done, Mr. Cosgrove?
A meeting with the Prince of Turbingen is impossible.
That fool didn't know what was the meaning of a hundred-pound bill, which was in the pocket-book that the fellow took from me.
Mister Bracegirdle said to me that he had heard her ladyship lives in some fear of her life, and meditated a separation, in which case, she might later repudiate any documents signed by herself while in durance, and subject them, at any rate, to a doubtful and expensive litigation. They were quite insistent on this point, and said they must have absolute assurance of her ladyship's perfect freewill in the transaction before they would advance a shilling of their capital.
Well, if my intentions are what you think they are -- if I do wish to step into your shoes, what then?  I have no other intentions than you had yourself.  Lady Cosgrove's wealth may be great, but am I not of a generous nature enough to use it worthily?  Her rank is lofty, but not so lofty as my ambition.  I will be sworn to muster just as much regard for my Lady Cosgrove as you ever showed her; and if I win her, and wear her when you are dead and gone, corbleu, knight, do you think that it will be the fear of your ghost will deter me?
He is only curious to know who you are.
What about Pike?
This isn't our area. Whose area is this --
Hey, I --  Holy fuck... holy fuck, what the fuck did you guys do?
Shut the fuck up, you fucking faggot, You just shut the FUCK UP.
We finished the course and came here, then heard an explosion --  Where's Pike?
You did Basic here?
Well, why didn't you say so? We'll just drop all your charges, then --
You shot Childs and Nunez.
You saved Kendall's life --
He was sickly. Had that shaking thing, whatd'yacall it, epoxy?
Back up.
Where's the cabin?
Whose blood is that, Jay?
What do you mean, West's?
Right?
I've done nothing wrong.  I'm the victim here.
He admitted it.
Why did he come back for you?
You tried to pin three stone murders on Dunbar --
Dunbar was running out the door? Ohhhhhh... See that's where I was confused, because I thought you said Nunez was running out the door.
Jail if he's lucky, the gas chamber if he's not --
Why?
How do you know?
This is Warrant Officer Julia Osborne, the closest thing we have to an in- house investigator.
The official term for it is "Clusterfuck". By the time Beth hit us, I'd canceled all off base exercises save one -- a six man cadet team and their Drill out in the bush. We're missing three and the Sergeant. The cadets are in their eighth week of the cycle, nobody here knows much about them, up to and including their names. But the Sergeant...
He's not done by a longshot, I can get more out of him --
Nevertheless --
You think you could explain all this to me?
What I can't understand is why you signed these. If you'd just let West take care of the paperwork, no one would have known, but you got careless. So when Pike finally told the truth you had to get rid of him, too.
Toxicology report came back. Kendall's attack was caused by a drug known as anephadrine, maybe you've heard of it. It's for asthmatics. If an epileptic takes enough, it kills them. I checked with the nurses at the hospital -- you're the only other person who visited Kendall.
Gotta be honest, I love what you've done with the place --
Levi? Who names their kid Levi --
I questioned him for three hours and he didn't make a sound. You don't have a badge, he won't talk to you.
We're in the middle of a murder case --
You guys really got the shit kicked out of you here.
I just... He came back for Kendall. I don't think he's capable of murder.
Why the fuck wasn't he in restraints?
Why do you care?
Little bit.
For what?
This isn't the time --
Nah.
A word of advice about women -- that first hour or so after they kill their boss? Probably not the best time to hit on them.
Your phone number?
We should tell him we're not going.
I was freezing from the hurricane --
We just want --
Nunez was chasing Dunbar.
But you didn't see it, right?
Running out of time, are we? Tick- tock, tick-tock, how long till your witnesses fly the coop?
It won't work --
Dunbar's telling the truth.
What the fuck happened to you --
Thank God...
This place is going, Mueller. We gotta move --
Cadet Michael Mueller, I hereby place you under military arrest for the murder of Sergeant Nathan West --
So?
Those who I deem unworthy to pass through this camp will quit, and those who refuse to quit I will kill. You ever hear of a training accident -- give me a sir, yes, sir!
In my time I have killed sixteen men for the good of my country, sixteen men whose entrance into this Army I could not condone, as it would weaken the fabric of this nation's defense! This base suffers an average of three training accidents a year, unfortunate incidents that I will not hesitate to repeat if you cross me, understand -- give me a sir, yes, sir!
What do you mean? You don't even know me.
Someone stole my backpack.
I don't have a job, but I would have a job if you gave me one. And I may not have much, but I have more determination than any man you're ever going to meet.
Bloom like a flower?
You were expecting me?
The poet? What ever happened to him?
You won't find a better place!
Fine, you do it.
I'm eight. That means when I'm eighteen, you'll be 28. And when I'm 28, you'll only be 38.
How are you gonna make it without your shoes?
You must be Edward Bloom.
Helping people makes me happy.
Don't. Don't be embarrassed. I should never have let you think that...  I am in love with my wife.
Hi. How are you feeling?
You're just trying to get me to leave, aren't you? That's why they sent you here.
Karl.
You know anyone's who's taken it?
The one about the witch.
No, but I hear it's terrible. Then you spend years trying to corrupt and mislead this child, fill its head with nonsense and still it turns out perfectly fine.
Truly. I saw it in The Eye.
I saw my death in that eye. And this is not how it happens.
When did you ever work in an office?
Your mother hasn't been keeping up the pool. If you wanted to you could...
Why not religion, Dad?
The maple tree and the Buick. We heard it.
I'm trying to make a metaphor here.
The river.
Oh.
How did you get so many?
You don't even know me.
I was drying out.
It's me. Norther Winslow.
This is it? The whole vault.
Mmm.
Do you love your father?
How is he?
I know it's not easy. Just remember, he didn't choose to be your father and you didn't choose to be his son. You just ended up together. You could pick numbers out of a dark bag and it'd be just the same. If you ask me, it's a wonder parents and children can stand each other at all.
So you never bought any land.
Mom, do you want some time with Dad?
You know what for.
When we went to the Hard Rock Cafe. Who paid? When we went to see 'Cats'. Who paid?
What's this?
That's not a burn.
This is sensitive. Your car. Lovely car. Doesn't necessarily give the right impression.
Right.
No.
She says 'Hello' to you. Go for it John!
She says she has a secret to tell.
You are not ashamed of it? It's no surprise to want to love.
How is bank?
Just leave her alone.
I'm pretty nervous. Are you?
So. Is it different to how you imagined it?
Good. Or should I speak slower?
Do you follow or should I speak slower?
I don't understand.
They go.
I do. I want to very badly.
In every sense. If at all possible.
Where's the restroom?
I'm going to be sick. Where's the...
I'm going... I am... I'm going to be sick.
Not the kids type then is he? Not that broody. You must be pretty miffed.
Excuse me?
I don't hate you.
So what? Do you just switch off in your head or do you imagine you're with him, or what?
Sometimes which?
You should stop smoking. You're pregnant. You smoke like a fucking lab dog.
I've got news for you. It's not working.
Okay. Thank you.
It's not mine.
Why?
No. What? No. I know.
Is the flight full?
You know the rules.  You do know the rules, don't you?
Lazarus?
I'm standing most of my day. They're for support.  Didn't see you in church this mornin'.
My little niece... she got this deep cough.
Thank you.  Oh. My wife. She had a card here for her migraine pills. She ain't gonna be around no more... So if you...
I's thinkin' about singing in the choir.
Mm-hm. I don't know if I got a good voice or not but... practice is only on Mondays and Wednesdays, so...
When? Now? Oh. No.
More cough syrup?
Cuz let me tell you, you boys gotta run the ball more. You get into a kicking game, ya'll gonna lose.
Still need a lift?
Holy shit.
I can't get Rae on the phone. She's not at home... none of her friends seen her anywhere.
It's not like I can't go out and have fun with my friends.
Nothing's gonna happen. Not like everybody over there is in the line of fire with them Arabs blowin' themselves up.
Think this about money still, ya old fool?
Laz... You can't say nothin'...
Don't... don't say that to me...
Where's Ronnie?
Let me say somethin' first...
I ain't laid a hand on ya but to ease yo fever... Remember like I say, I found you in the road...
Gal, you ain't right yet.
You some kind'a pervert?
Now you get up! And you get in my house!
Wicked little bitch... gonna cut me...
I said... STOP!
You like this? Walkin' me through this field like I's your mule?
Cuz once in a while soil need a change. Corn take up a lot of nitrate in the fertilizer. So next crop what ya do is plant ya some soy beans. That give off a lot of nitrate. Change keeps it all growin' and growin' strong.  Sting a bit?
Good. Now I got the steaks on, potatoes at a boil, and biscuits ready to pop in the oven. R.L. and Lincoln out yonder grillin' up the corn. What do you know how to make?
You take it straight?
If you want... I can take you back to town now.
I seen a man die. He couldn't breathe... his heart was... was givin' out.
Where you gonna be?
How you feelin' today?
Do you call it a game when only one man win each time? I think you call it a damn shame.
That ain't up to me to hook you up. Naw what I mean? She her own, you know?
Like I say, you wanna hook that up... I ain't in ya way. That switch of hers been all over this town. Got that sickness, you know.
She a freak. Got what you call a sexual addiction.
First hooked up with that bitch when she was 16. Girl was fuckin' the principal and two of her teachers. You know coach Reynolds?
You ain't gonna make a fuss, are you?  Nothing a man can do when a woman make up her mind.
You get a call from Rose?
Goin' dove huntin'?
Are you outta ya GODDAMN MIND?
A naked woman, chained in ya house?
Why don't you go'on and ask her. She need to talk wit somebody with sense. Folks been ruttin' and beatin' on this gal all her days. And this is how I'm handling it.
Mm. MM. Now these eggs got some kick to it. What'chu got in this?
Heard about this morning.
And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love.  Who gives this girl in marriage?
You a preacher?
It starts like this... fire... that spreads. Starts in my head. Then moves to my stomach. Then it goes lower. I can stop it sometimes but mostly I just jump on and ride it out... then everything'll go back to normal, you know. Only thing ever took that feeling away was... was... when I met Ronnie.  Cuz I love him so much. He's all I got in my life that's special. And I like taking care of him and helping him when he gets nervous. When I can do that for him... it's like I'm givin' somethin' of myself that I haven't givin' nobody else.
It's stupid... It's so fucking stupid!
Ain't been a week and you already some nigger's whore? Gill told me. Told me how you and he... you and everybody...
Goddamn it, I ask you a question, you better answer it, or I'm gonna blast a hole in ya!
Since you workin' on the square now, maybe we could get some coffee in the morning, if you want.
You got any money?
Whoa, I knew you were going to say that.  I absolutely anticipated that, Nick.  But I said to myself, Charlie, Charlie, we can move up on this, so go find Nicklaus... He'll be pissed for a moment, but then it'll dawn on him --
Frank Abolofia.
Some party.
I call, right?  I say I got the dreaded thirty six-hour Asian shits from some raw clam and we stretch it into three days.  You and I become a driving force on the local Geisha scene.
I just want you to know... I mean anybody who says you ever took has got to deal with me.
... Detective Ich-iro Matsu-moto. Hey, we're getting Mr. Moto on our side.
This should be it...
Now that's the kind of motorcycle I want to see you on.
Squid?
It's getting too cold even for me, Nick.
You know, Inspector, you take shit once, you take shit forever.
How'd you get this?
Know her?
Work, lunch, groceries, laundry... Fabulous...
You can't come in.  They don't want --
Ich, my name is Nick.  Not Nicklaus, not Nicklaus-san, not Nick-san. Nick.
It's very small.
You know, Nick, we can't lose.
Think we'll get him, Nick?
An outside person.  A foreigner.  A barbarian.  You, me.  More you.
I need your help, Joyce.
You're wrong to sell Ich short.
You'll get Ich killed.
Bullshit, Nick.  And don't tell me this is all just about Charlie. It's not.
Can't make you change your mind?
Sugai won't give it to me, you know that.
He's wanted in Japan.  They want him first.  Then we can have him.
How?  You don't know the place.  You don't know the language.  Get on the plane.
... Remember, counterfeiting is the Feds.  They'll be all over Abolofia's place.  Stick tight. You I.D. the other plate, he does real time.
What's this?
Your plane leaves at six.  Two officers will escort you.
-- Do you know where she is, detective?  Do you know how to find her?  Even where to start?  We will find them.
What's the point?
Yeah.  It might be better if we talk in private, Sebastian.  Why don't you go home.
Then a repressor protein that blocks the operating cells.
I've done some questionable things.
Why are you staring at us?
You're our best and only friend.
When?
This is my Uncle Roy, Sebastian.
I think, therefore I am.
The Tyrell Corporation has a demo model.  Check it out on the Voight-Kampff.  There's a chance the Nexus-6 is beyond out ability to detect.  If that's the case, everybody's up shit creek.
Industrial refuse.
Look, go home.  Get some rest. Take an aspirin.
Well, when do you get paid?
What about a summary then.
Not if it works.
Okay, gimme a run-down on the three females.
But I would like to buy you drink.
Prosit.
How long you had these guys?
Prosit.
You like to kiss her goodbye.
Hey, it's okay.  I like to pee. So how are you doing?
What's that?
Nerves of steel.
What if you change your mind?
You sure?
I didn't know if I wanted to handle her -- I already got a snake act.  But my partner goes down there to the Opera House on suck night to book the good ones.
That's what we call in the trade, audition free-for- alls and most of it sucks. Bit I don't think that's her.
There's been reports of management sexually abusing the artists in this place.
What the fuck for?
It that mother real?
You'd be surprised what a guy'll go through to get a glimpse of a beautiful body.
It seems your department doesn't believe out new unit is to the public benefit.
Why not?
There's two reasons a man rejects help.  Either because he's so good at what he does he doesn't think he needs it, or he's so insecure he can't admit it.
You use your equipment, don't you?
Did you cry when your father died?
I don't know, I have nothing to compare it to.  I guess I thought there was something more to it.
They could clean around the arrangement.
Bad?
But in your profession that is a risk.
Well?
How many questions did it take?
You're not responding to the stimulus.  I can see right here, I'm not getting a reading.
Already had I.Q. test this year -- but I don't think I never had a...
Know what a turtle is?
But I understand what you mean.
Beautiful.
And you live in this building all by yourself?
What makes you think so?
You're kidding!
Your mom was a dancer?
Right.
Again.
So for four thousand dollars, all I have to do is drive you to your hotel?
So...Mister Andretti, your first time on the freeway?
Wait, Eve, please!  Wait.
I knew this would happen!  You're like a lost puppy!
Troy? Is he your husband? Or a boyfriend?
Watching television in color.
...Okay.
I don't want to be alone.
It didn't used to be that way.
One who's not a mutant.
Stop that ma'am crap!
Never drive again!
Why, thank you!  Very nice to have met you, Cliff!  May I ask you a question?
Okay, let's see...I'm not promising anything. You okay?
In the house?
The what?
No!  Not crazy!
What have you ordered?
Yeah.  Could be.  Go say hello, Romeo. Looks like a healthy non-mutant to me.
What?
I've never lied to you.  I've maybe let you believe things that you wanted to believe, but I've never lied.
I'm really sorry!
What?
There.
...I do.
Is that a birthday cake?!
This is what money looks like.  It comes like this, in coin, or like this in paper.  Or you can have an "investment."  These are stock "certificates" that we bought in your name.  Of course, they're worthless now, but at one time they were quite valuable.
Sorgen sie bitte dafur das die gepack sorgfaltic behandeldt warren!
What's baseball?
Holy Cow! What the heck are these?!
Adam...don't forget...don't forget ...
You're sure?
That's what everybody believes?
Right on the button.
Well, we try. Listen, let me just ask you a few questions.  When did Alaska become a state?
This must be very new.
No.
Why not? He has great pants.
Isn't it a little tiring to sit up straight like that?
Why did you park way back there?
You bet!
No, I wouldn't go in one of those places with a gas mask on.
Does that work?
You dial nine to get out.
No kiddin'. Well...good night.
Up here on the fifteenth floor?
Then I'll need, twelve into nine hundred, seventy-five boxes. And that's almost...five hundred dollars just for the hamburger! And my Mom only gave me three thousand dollars for everything! The yacht batteries! The diesel oil! The birthday candles!
Sir? I would really appreciate it if you wouldn't take the Lord's name in vain again.
Dad!
Your father has a few final words for you. You know, he'd fight a buzz saw for you - he loves you so much. We both do.
...and his church group have volunteered to help us bring the supplies down.  But we've got to hurry.
I think I'm being chased by a psychiatrist.
No!  Not the police!  Don't call them!
No, I can't have that! They'll come with their cars and their guns and their handcuffs--
You know, I don't think so. I'm confused but you know, I don't think he'd ever hurt me. I don't think he'd hurt anyone.
Good god.
Yes, yes, the song.  So tell me...has it been...hell up here?
Calvin, I wish you would have at least let me do the dishes. It's not going to be that easy getting all that dried- on food off my nice plates.
Days??
Thirty -five years!
To go up.
No. No! Calvin, this is different! Believe me!
No.  I think it's just right.
Why?
Not bad for a three and a half year old! I'd like to see the public school system match that! I don't care how terrific it is!
What did you wish for, Adam?
Let's eat our cake.
Others are...multi-sexual.  It seems...they can be both masculine and feminine...simultaneously.
They've done a lot of re-building but society, at least as we knew it, has utterly collapsed. People throw up in the streets. Others point guns. There's something terribly wrong with the automobiles and...and I...I can't tell you the rest.  I just can't.
He's smart.
You came back for these?
So, Adam...where on earth are you from?
Give me your hand.
But first, you have to start with the clothes!
I'm sorry. But if the shoe fits.
How 'bout it, Eve? Can he skate around your block?
Or pee in their pants when they see the ocean!
Well...I admit it. I'm glad to hear that.
Good God...you don't think there really is a bomb shelter, do you?
What do you want to do with it?
And if we can't find him?
Millions upon millions upon millions! The cards. The stock!  The clothes! The toothpaste!  The guy was on the level!  And you blew it!  A man walks into your life who is the kindest, most polite, honest, trustworthy, incredibly rich guy you have ever met in your life!! And what do you do?!
Adam!!
I miss those nice flower-power kids. How 'bout you?
I'm selling this place.  I want out of this hell hole!
I think it's important not to get depressed. Depression is a terrible thing. They say it can bring on illness.
Jeffrey, you're not going down by Lincoln, are you?
Well, I haven't seen any. I wouldn't worry about it. Look, I better go.
I don't want to talk about it. Everything's okay now. I don't want to talk about it.
Frank, I have something for you. Excuse us everyone.
He's alright, I guess. I hope. They're doing tests, that's why I'm home from school. I was over at the hospital this morning and I was going home and in the field behind our neighborhood. There behind Vista, I found an ear.
Come into the study a minute.
Anything you can tell me?
Is that why you say it's horrible?
I guess you've seen some bad things.
Why do you do it?
What color is it?
Okay, come on in. Looks like you had a bad face lift.
You're all through with this now?
Oh God, that stuff stinks.
You tell me!! Let me see that wallet.  Jeffrey Beaumont. What're you doing in my apartment, Jeffrey Beaumont?
How many times have you sneaked into girls' apartments and watched them undress?
What do you want from me?
Sure I'm alright. 
Don?
Do you like the way I feel?
Don't say that.
I looked for you in my closet tonight.  It's crazy, I don't know where you came from, but I like you.
Oh shit.
Who is Don?
No. I should go.
Yes. Frank--
Shut up.
Wait a minute. Wait. Whatiya want? For cryin' out loud!
I love you Don with all my heart.
Yes.
Yeah, it's me.
Where have you been?  Oh God, they hurt him, Jeffrey. Jeffrey, Jeffrey, Jeffrey, hold me. HOLD ME. Oh God.
They hurt his head.
Where are we going, Frank?
Don't say PLEASE, Fuckhead. WHAT ARE THESE?
You seemed to see some very interesting things on your little escapade with Dorothy Vallens.
We're going to leave that up to Detective Williams. I'll tell you though, you're okay. You shot a real son of a bitch.
No thanks.
Hey neighbor. Here's to Ben.
Hey? You like to walk.
No, I want ya to fuck it. Shit, yes, pour the fuckin' beer.
What time are visiting hours?
I'm going out for awhile.
Can I use the car tonight?
Oh yeah?
No. You're not bothering me. You a senior?
That's the building. She lives on the Seventh Floor. Don't stop to look long, the police are watching.
You really do hear a lot, don't you?
I have to help out in my father's hardware store. They're giving me sort of my own hours for a while, which is nice.
I guess I'll see you sometime.
I'd like to talk to you about something.
I don't know, it sounds like a good daydream, but actually doing it is too weird. Too dangerous.
Okay, I'm going ahead. Wait a minute, what's her name?
No. I only saw his back. He went down another stairwell at the end of the hall.
I'll tell Mike I'm sick. There's a game tonight anyway and he'll never miss me. Afterwards he can go out with the guys. Just so the record is kept straight though, I love Mike. What do want me to do?
I already know. The "Slow Club". It's on Route 7.
Brilliant.
That sounds good.
Here's to. An interesting experience.
Jeffrey, I don't think you ought to do it.
It's crazy and dangerous. My God, I shouldn't have told you.
I, I don't want to see you tomorrow. Mike's coming over.
Okay, yeah, call.
What's with Mike?
You want to tell me about it?
Wow. Should you tell my father?
No, silly - I'm still in school you know. But I'll meet you after school and you can tell me what you've learned. You better be careful, Jeffrey.
What am I going to do?
Oh my God. What's wrong?
Take her to my house. My dad can get an ambulance faster than anyone. Do you have anything to put around her?
Jeffrey? What's going on?
I don't know why we have to watch TV.
Look under the body.
Ah, Agent Smecker, we have a problem.
Poppa Joe said there was only two. In and out.  Boy, you guys sure did a good job. You're good, huh? Cool masks. Where'd you get them?
What?
What are you saying?
Look again for fuck sake!
You little fuck. Let him go. I'll drop you right here.
Let him go or I will deliver you, right now. 
You guys?
No ma! No!
Yeah, we promise.
I think it's better if we find this man before he finds us again.
Hold this shit for us, Doc. We'll be comin back for it when we get out.
me up the...
How many feminists does it take to screw in a light bulb?
Aaaww, shit!... evil woman!
Oh, Jesus.
"What do we tell him about the guns and money?"
A p-penny saved is worth two in the bush.
Yeah, these guys always got a lot of rope strapped around em in the movies and they always end up using it.
Nervous?
See. I told you there'd be a shaft.
That was way easier than I thought.
Mafiosos getting caught with 20 kilos and walkin' on bail the same day.
He isn't to be touched.
Each day we will spill their blood till it rains down from the skies.
I prefer to be called Rozengurtle by men.
Okay, just cut off as much fat as you can as it goes by and the rule of thumb here is...
Baumgartner sound Irish to you, fuck face?
No! Fuck you! You start getting excited! We gotta fucking go!
Your what?! Your fuckin' what?!
So Duffy, got any theories to go with that... tie.
Uh.  Shit, I, uh...
Oh, she's quite proud of herself.
Fuck you!
No. You sure you're okay?
Hello?
No. You sure you're okay?
Vincenzo, that fat motherfucker, Yakavetta's right hand. He's the one who set me up. Then he went around shooting his mouth off, telling everyone I was as good as dead. He goes in there every Wednesday night around 10:00, he jerks off in the same booth to the same titty dancer. Never misses.
Well, truth be known, those first ones just kinda fell into our laps.
You look like Mush Mouth from Fat Albert.
Shit!... Shit! He ain't here.
Hey! We gotta talk about this early morning church shit.
Why have you come to a church for council if you're not religious?
Yes.
Just be natural, goddamit.
Poppa Joe, you want me to go now?
The funny man. Well, I got a new job for you, just for now. Roc, I'm having a real shitty day. I'm depressed. Tell me a funny story or a joke.
Did you see what I meant about the window?
It had an alarm.
Now. One thing we need to discuss is timing. Timing is absolutely crucial. What are you doing? Anthony!
Is that the manager?
Holy shit.
Right. Get back to me on that one. Once your plan is worth a shit.
When'd he tell you?
Man. I'm sorry. We just went for a walk --
Inez has a master key to all these rooms, doesn't she?  Doesn't she?
Our money situation is not good.
A $500 tip! For the housekeeper!
You're in love with the fucking housekeeper!
It's big, Anthony. Real big. It's called Hinckley Cold Storage.
What time did he say to be here?
He doesn't want to fight.
I don't know, Dignan. You went crazy.
OK. Mark that down.
God. Isn't this great? Working on the job. Got a wheel man. Got a safecracker. Good friends with Mr. Henry.
He was a nice guy.
Not at all. The place is totally deserted.
Where's Kumar?
There's not enough time.
Why?
Mr. Henry never gave you a test, did he?
Where?
When we go through the next gate you'll have 30 seconds to take out the tower guard.
I'd like to live in that place. Hinckley Cold Storage.
Congratulations. You passed the test.
Did Dignan take the test?
Well, he agreed 100% that Bob should be dropped. And he also agreed you were a liability. But he felt his talent would make up for your weaknesses.
Are you afraid?
Future Man.
Could you grow cinnamon?
What the fuck is Dignan doing with that cop? He loves them.
Why don't you just tell them the truth. Those belong to my neighbor Phil.
You think he got my license plates?
How long are they going to hold him?
What?
You don't have to talk about it if you don't want to.
I know it must of been a bad experience. But it doesn't sound like it was your fault.
At first they were going to charge me with manslaughter. That's partly why I was in custody so long. Sixty days.
Yeah. One minute you're studying Great Expectations and the next minute you're drawing the Holy Mary for some kid who tried to stab his girlfriend.
Well, because you guys don't look alike.
What are you doing?
Yeah.
Let's go, Abdul-Shabazz.
There's a lot of valuable shit in there, Applejack. The silver and the china. The crystal. And the grandfather clock. Goddammit, I bet that clock's worth ten grand.
Wait. Did he see us?
They are.
Well. What do you want to do? You want to steal one or just drive your car?
If it's that easy why doesn't everybody grow them?
Don't you guys tell anybody about my plants.
I'm going to take a look at this.
What's your fucking problem? You're a shithead!
I paid for it.
This is natural.
Did we get it?
Was Dignan screaming like, Get me a bag!
What do you mean get back?
Give me the keys, Dignan.
Yes, I do.
Right. It was extremely stupid.
Bob, you're lying!
I couldn't hear anything.
I said to the DA, That cop who hit me must of given me CRS disease.
Do you have your own room?
Hold on --
Wait a second --
Your brother was up here the other day. He said you ran away from home.
Oh, yeah.
Where did he go?
What's the story?
What?
The world needs dreamers, son.
That's not gonna fly.
What's definitive, is that I just lost two people in Berlin!
Call a Mayday into Berlin station. We need snipers, DOD, whatever they got. Snipers?
Oh, God... It must have been Bourne.
Jesus... I, Zorn... I have to call his family. Tell them...
Sit down.
In the end, honestly, it's hubris. Simple hubris. You reach a point in this game when the only satisfaction left is to see how clever you are.
Sir...
I did my box work, but I wanted to show you before I showed Landy. I came out here last night because none of this was making any sense. I mean, I'm with you on this, Conklin was a nut, but a traitor? I just can't get there.
Is it a slam dunk? No, but...
Who else knows about this?
Show me again...
Sit. Can you...  [The chair. Have the chair.]
I have to go now.
-- car keys?
Where were you, Jason? In the car.
You drive.
I love you, too.
See that tram coming around the corner?
How do they know that? How can they know any of that?
Why are you here, then?
No... Jason... please...
What do you want?
Okay, how do you want to do it?
Who?
Don't need it. I remember everything.
We need to get in there.
-- so there were two of these explosive charges placed on the power lines. One of them failed. The fingerprint...  That's from the one that didn't go off.
Maybe he just needed a place to spend the night?
-- who? -- who else is here? --
Okay, cut to the chase, Pam. What are you selling?
Amnesia?
Is it fresh?
What do you think? Is he coming in?
Let's give him half an hour.
Black coat, possibly leather. Dark slacks. Dark t-shirt.  He says they're gonna try and corral the guests on the street over there, and then check them out, but...
Yes. In that order.
What it means in England -- and in Scotland too -- is that rebels have forfeited their lands. We were ambushed last night. But the Scots dragged their dead away.
If I pay homage to another's throne, then how am I a king?
What choice do they have? Now they must serve us or starve.
I am cheerful with a plan to soothe your miseries. All of England shudders with the news of renewed rebellion.
Nor you. To you that word is as unfamiliar as love.
We make spears. A hundred spears. Fourteen feet long.
The Bruce is not coming, William.
Stephen ready?
Rest, William.
You know it's a trap.
Three, maybe more!
Wanna stay with me tonight?
We'll get those English pigs tomorrow.
You'll move
All right, Father, I'll ask him!  If I risk my neck for you, will I get a chance to kill Englishmen?
My son's loyal wife returns, unkilled by the heathen. So he accepted our bribe.
Then why does he stay? My scouts say he has not advanced.
No. I have it to ease the suffering of the children of this war.
I have faced him. Have you?
-- while many who serve him have taken and broken his oath many times. I cannot commit treason, if I have never been his subject!
Thank you for accepting.
You've been here before?
Did it work?
I want... to marry you!
I don't want to scare you. I want to be yours, and you mine. Every night like this one.
I'm dreaming.
I don't want to wake. I want to stay with you.
Did God make you the sacker of peaceful cities? The executioner of the king's nephew, my husband's own cousin?
Anything.
You'd be surprised how often they are.
Evan wake up, oh please wake up!
Darn it!
I don't like this place, Mom. It's creepy. Please can we go? I promise I won't make any more bad pictures!
Please, mom. People will talk.
Why do you ask?
I don't know. These things take time.
Okay, doc. What's the damage? How much time have I got?
Just. Like. Jason.
Because I think he sent me to your cell on purpose. For you to help me.
Are you hurting her?
Go on. Nothing can hurt you. Remember, this is only a movie. You're completely safe.
You really think he wanted to kill you?
Whasamatter? Lost your Rolex?
We should go soon. If Dad catches us smoking down here, we're dead.
I'm sorry Kayleigh. This was a bad idea.
Not since we were kids.
Not if you remember my dad.
Actually, Kayleigh, the reason I came back to town was to talk to you.
When we were kids. Your dad was making a movie. Robin Hood or something?
Just shut up, Evan. You're wasting your breath.
It's my fault. I should have told you he was released a few weeks ago.
Wait. Something's not right. Isn't that your jacket?
Oh, I thought you were my eight o'clock. Make it fast, I'm expecting someone.
Oh, I'm sorry. Does my line of work make you uncomfortable, precious?
On the bridge. How did you know that Tommy had your dog? That was no fucking hunch.
Off to change everyone's life again, is that it? Maybe this time you'll pop up in some mansion while I wind up in Tijuana doing the donkey act.
Is something the matter?
I never knew that. So then you still sometimes think of us... together?
We're really gonna be in a movie!?
Where am I? What happened? Where did we all go?
What's happened to -- How are you doing that?
There is no "right". When you change who people are, you destroy who they were.
Evan, you're hysterical. You study for this?
Thanks. Wow. Hey, I want to do something really special for Kayleigh tomorrow. If I said I needed some help from you and the brothers...
Tommy, I'm bored shitless over here. What's up already?
I did what you said, man! We're pooling our student funds with Hillel House and we're going to have an Awareness Dance.
Evan, guess what? Dad got a new video camera and we're all gonna be in a movie.
I should have known.
No, of course not. Do you mind if I do?
Does he know that?
And he is still willing to give you a visa?
Nobody ever loved me that much.
Go back to Bulgaria.
Monsieur Rick, I --
Monsieur Rick, may I get you a cup of coffee?
Well, you are in pretty good shape, Herr Rick.
-- Don't tell me where you're going.
The police break up our meeting. Herr Rick! We escaped in the last moment.
Yes, I come.
I'd better be going.
I never drink in the morning. And every time you send my shipment over, it's always just a little bit short.
The bourbon.  The news about Ugarte upset me very much.
Rick, I'll put my cards on the table. I think you know where those letters are.
Don't forget, you owe Rick's a hundred cartons of American cigarettes.
Rick?
And Mademoiselle?
That is also true, except for one destination, to return to occupied France.
But be serious, darling. You are in danger and you must leave Paris.
Yes, of course, we --
Oh. I saved my first drink to have with you. Here.
Please don't. Don't, Rick. I can understand how you feel.
I'm sorry I was in no condition to receive you when you called on me last night.
You use "Richard" again? We're back in Paris.
Your unexpected visit isn't connected by any chance with the letters of transit? It seems that as long as I have those letters I'll never be lonely.
No. Oh, Richard, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, but, but you, you are our last hope. If you don't help us, Victor Laszlo will die in Casablanca.
Put them on the table.
Oh, it wasn't my secret, Richard. Victor wanted it that way. Not even our closest friends knew about our marriage. That was his way of protecting me. I knew so much about his work, and if the Gestapo found out I was his wife it would be dangerous for me and for those working with me.
But why my name, Richard?
I don't understand. What about you?
I'm saying it because it's true. Inside of us we both know you belong with Victor. You're part of his work, the thing that keeps him going. If that plane leaves the ground and you're not with him, you'll regret it.
Yes.
Some of the old songs, Sam.
I must find out what Berger knows.
Yes, I see. When I had trouble getting out of Lille, why didn't you leave me there? And when I was sick in Marseilles and held you up for two weeks and you were in danger every minute of the time, why didn't you leave me then?
Yes, Yes I know. Victor, whatever I do, will you believe that I, that --
Are you ready Ilsa?
Captain, the boy who is playing the piano, somewhere I have seen him.
Good evening.
Monsieur Blaine, I wonder if I could talk to you?
You must know it's very important I get out of Casablanca. It's my privilege to be one of the leaders of a great movement. You know what I have been doing. You know what it means to the work, to the lives of thousands and thousands of people that I be free to reach America and continue my work.
Isn't it strange that you always happened to be fighting on the side of the underdog?
I'll raise it to two hundred thousand.
Merely to welcome you to Casablanca and wish you a pleasant stay. It is not often we have so distinguished a visitor.
Let us say that it is my request. That is a much more pleasant word.
Tomorrow at ten at the Prefect's office.
With pleasure. Won't you sit down?
I am afraid not. My regrets, Monsieur.
Even in Berlin.
You will give us the names?
Unoccupied France welcomes you to Casablanca.
What else, my dear Major?
Good evening, gentlemen.
May I recommend Veuve Cliquot '26, a good French wine.
Rick is completely neutral about everything. And that takes in the field of women, too.
Of course, one must admit he has great courage.
You see, Captain, the situation is not as much under control as you believe.
If you are thinking of warning him, don't put yourself out. He cannot possibly escape.
Victor Laszlo.
Manages what?
Oh, but I just told you. --
Is that a serious offer?
Make it ten. I am only a poor corrupt official.
Oh, laugh if you will, but I happen to be familiar with your record. Let me point out just two items. In 1935 you ran guns to Ethiopia. In 1936, you fought in Spain on the Loyalist side.
The winning side would have paid you much better.
Serves me right for asking a direct question. The subject is closed.
So Yvonne's gone over to the enemy.
But you haven't any actual proof, and you know it. This isn't Germany or occupied France. All you can do is fine him a few thousand francs and give him thirty days. You might as well let him go now.
I'll arrange to have Laszlo come there to pick up the letters of transit, and that'll give you the criminal grounds on which to make the arrest. You get him, and we get away. To the Germans that last will be just a minor annoyance.
I see. How do I know you'll keep your end of the bargain?
Ricky, I'm going to miss you. Apparently you're the only one in Casablanca who has even less scruples than I.
I thought I asked you to tie up your watchdogs.
You know, this place will never be the same without you, Ricky.
If you don't mind, you fill in the names. That will make it even more official.
I suppose you know this isn't going to be pleasant for either of us, especially for you. I'll have to arrest you of course.
Uh huh.
Give me another.
Rick, I'm sick and tired of having you --
I would advise you not to interfere.
May I? Too bad about those two German couriers, wasn't it?
Thank you.  Will you have a drink with me please?
He'll double what I pay you.
Ain't you planning on going to bed in the near future?
Boss, let's get out of here.
They grab Ugarte and she walks in. Well, that's the way it goes. One in, one out. Sam?
What's that you're playing?
If she can stand it, I can. Play it!
This sort of takes the sting out of being occupied, doesn't it, Mr. Richard?
It took this test package thirty-two hours to get from Seattle to St. Petersburg, a distance of nine thousand miles.  And then it took forty-one hours to get from our warehouse in St. Petersburg to here, a distance of, what --
Nobody remembers that.
Save some for tomorrow.
Shit!  Shit!  Shit!
Can't.  Need water.
Okay look, I know you're tired, I know you're thirsty, but give it one more shot, you've just got to do a little more.
If they can't see you, what's the point?
You fucking bleeding heart, you kill or you die.
Look, just slip off the raft.  The ocean would feel so good, the water's so soft and warm.  Take a little swim.  Sleep.
It's a fucking soccer ball, you idiot.
Want to come in?  Get dry for a minute.
Yeah.  A long time ago.
No.  that was the last one.
Yeah, a long one.
Sonofabitch!
I can't even keep fish alive.
What, you were going to come over the next day all calm and say, Kelly that really made me mad?  Don't tell me you're mad.  Be mad.  Be who you are right now.
Get back?  From where?
I got married.
I would never --
If I'd known you were alive --
All that time I waited to go on a cruise, and you went without me.
What was inside?
The plane went down.  My friends died.  I washed up on an island.  Then I found these barrels, built the raft, and here I am.
You okay?
I've got to get back to Memphis. Hannah's babysitter has finals.
Which I didn't have.
Yes, yes he did.
I used to drive one of those.  A long time ago.
Thought you were going to bring her.
But chickens?
What happened to your pants?
Look, I help take care of the place.  You got my check, didn't you Mom?
Mom, this is a farm.  We've got real strawberries growing outside, we've got real cream.
The place is falling apart.
I've got all this back pay coming.  Why don't you let me get you a place in town?
Kamal is not here.  We are very defused.
How'd it go?
I checked the weather, you had the jet stream, you could have made it up.
You fucked us over.
I'm from Arkansas.  Tell me a story with Robert E. Lee in it and maybe I'll pay attention.
Malaysia's tanking.  We're meeting in ten in operations.
Hello.
How about we go somewhere else?
To Wilson.
Take your time.
That's what it's about.
Not just that.  Take your time.  Use it. Live it.
What, then?
Permission to come aboard, sir.
As it happens, I'm headed for Frisco myself.
Wilbur, the adopting couple is waiting in your office.
They want to replace me! The Board of Trustees wants to *replace* me!
Oh, just stop it! You knew this was going to happen. He's a young man.
Uh... I'd like to show them that I can cook, a little.
Shouldn't we tell Homer?
It's gettin' late. I think I'll pack it in.
Oh...
A movie *outside*?
And what did she die of, exactly?
You're a natural. You were born to drive a car like this.
How could you not *care* about the movie?
Do you think I'm having a good time? Do you think I'm just *teasing* you? Do you think I *know* whether I want you or Wally?
We should take her to St. Cloud's. That much is obvious, isn't it? Let her make up her mind when she gets there...
She won't go to St. Cloud's!
I know.  Is *that* nothing.
"...did." Well, okay.
Do you think she'll be all right?
I know you don't think much of being needed, or of me for that matter...
No, I'm the one who should be sorry. You have every right to be angry.
How is that Wally doing?
You can trust me. Is it Jack? It's not Jack, is it? It's *Muddy*! Is it Muddy?
You've been giving him a *flying* lesson!
"Homer Wells, born Portland, Maine, March 2, 1915..."
You mean they'll replace you with someone who won't perform abortions.
So here is my candidate. What do you think?
Homer... doesn't King Kong think the woman is his *mother*?
Don't get too excited, Fuzzy.
I'm sorry. They're not used to seeing a car like this.
This is all normal. Don't worry. The abortion procedure... it affects you. It's the ether, too. It'll take a little time.
At what altitude?
Uh, look... if you're serious about wanting a job, picking apples isn't that boring.
So. What should I do now?
Are we supposed to be up here? The rules said...
Cider don't have no taste till later in October--it's too watery now, when we're usin' just them early Macs and them Gravensteins. You don't get no *good* cider till you're pickin' them Golden Delicious and them Winter Bananas, them Baldwins and them Russerts...
But she's your *daughter*...
I'm stayin', Homer.
There's more than one laceration, more than one cut.
It's obviously an aborticide.
If you take enough of it, your intestines lose their ability to absorb Vitamin C.
He doesn't like it.  He's a boy, That's why.
Okay, he's just a Wilbur then.
I thought it was my turn.
What I mean is... I would like it very much if you thought you could be happy here, Homer.
I'm not in trouble.
Give men that. I know how to do it.
I know more than I want to know about it. Who's the father?
Who cares?
Do you know him?
Ain't you gonna see what it is, Homer?
Where's your manners? Make room for Homer, so's he can enjoy the view.
*What* view?
That sounds like you is in trouble already, Homer.
You just go inside, Homer. We don't need no help.
But I'm not that late. You didn't have to give away my seat.
Thanks for playing along. I just have to sit for a while.
So, what do you do?
Can --
Uh, right... And that was it. That's when we decided to start our own business. No more shithead bosses.
Here's where a little research comes in handy. Corporate banks give out VP titles like calendars. It's a small lie, but now we're sure he's playing.
This has to happen fast.
Hey, Jake... When am I gonna get to play the Inside?
And I think it's because of this redhead...
Keeping the Fix happy.
So how'd you get caught?
We were back on.
Like putting on a play... Guess some people forgot their lines.
Ten is standard, sir.
Who's that?
What are you? New? Let me tell you how good this guy is. Last night, Al calls this bookie to settle up. Apparently he's been ducking him for like a month. So the guy asks him where he's got all this money all of a sudden, right? What does Al do? Does he tell him that he cashed in a fucking Bar Mitzvah bond? Does he tell him he's been giving head out back for twenty bucks a pop? No... He starts going on about this job he just pulled and how he fleeced some Wall Street asshole-type... How HE fleeced.
The red hair... It's bad luck.
Masters of our own destiny.
Shit.
Yeah... Whatever, Jake.
You laugh now, but wait until you need a clean place to powder. This is New York city, Sister. Public sanitation does not run very high on the city hall agenda. You know what you can get off a toilet or doorknob? Let's do the list... Hepatitis, influenza, the flesh eating disease --
Uh... No thanks. I'm not going all the way to Brooklyn for a hundred dollar pay-off.
We're going to make it back, Grant. Three or four times over.
You'll be there?
Buddy, that was business. Besides, you have more crew. Then there's you...
Stake you?
Come here. Feel this.
That tip not work-out for you fellas?
Special Agent Gunther Moonan. Ring a bell?
Attractive girl.
Take it from me, you never do. But congratulations. Nice to be married, isn't it?
I lost my head. I'm... Sorry. I don't know what happened.
Sorry about your wallet, but if you think I'm going to suck dick over thirty seven dollars, a maxed out Visa and a bad fake I.D., you're fucking crazy.  Jake.
Says who?
We had to see what your deal was. I'm just a little superstitious.
No.  What's my cut?
Mr. King, I think --
You need to get a haircut.
And some new clothes.
We're going to rope this banker tomorrow and you gotta at least look classy, if not be classy. You gotta do this thing and I don't even know if you can.
Uh... Everything okay?
I gotta go get a haircut.
I think you'd do it for free. You're almost drooling. You like the rush.
I'm your basic underachiever. Can't stand working and porn doesn't seem like a good option.
Whatever. But you... I get the feeling you could have bullshitted your way into anything. So why this?
Who says you have to know the King to be in a hole? I actually did have a real job once. When I was in high school, I worked as a candy striper.
No. You trusted him... You were just getting square.
Everyone's working an angle, right?
What about...
What do you get, Lily? Finder's Fee? Because it is all about the money, right?
Yeah.
I was supposed to meet him for breakfast. He likes that new IHOP they just opened, you know... He likes to order that thing. The Rutti- Tutti-Fresh and Fruity thing they got.
It's bad luck.
No. Big con. One rag. One rag and we get out from under all this. But we need another Shill.
Why?
It never worked before because A, they didn't flush the bank enough; B, their corporate papers were for shit; C, they didn't have someone on the inside with Customs.
We're getting a little old for running.
Feeling lucky today, Miles. Found a penny -- Heads up. There was an empty cab right outside my building. We hit every green light.
And we got rid of the red head.
A ring for my wife. A lot like that one. In fact, it was that one.
Thank you. Sorry, I'm just a little anxious to give it to her. You take out of state checks?
I know it's policy, but...  The thing is... It's our first anniversary and we're only in town for the weekend. It's a very, very special night for my wife and I. This ring is my gift to her and I think she's going to really love it. I can give you phone numbers to call for people who'll vouch. I can send you I.D. later...
So that's it, huh? You get the cops to give you a safe ride.
Hey, I been on the ramp all my life, so I got no problem with the way you help yourself, Jake.
Still time.
What?
Coupla things. They got this Fed looking around and the girl just split.
Preliminary forensics suggests he was sitting there, bloated and purple in his egg foo young for at least seventy two hours. Alfonse was not a small man and there was a lot of food ordered, so you can imagine the smell. Bad for the neighbors, good for me because in all the time I've been looking for Jake, this is only the second time I've even gotten a whiff of him.
Peace of mind.
He's headed towards the eastern most exit. Do not, under any circumstances approach. I want to follow this all the way down to Vig.
You sell it.
Bullshit it's cosmetic! My fucking tooth was cracked in half. I made the son of a bitch write it in as a cavity. The department's dental is for shit.
You're shaking.
Can you? I'm happy being a dealer. At least the punters keep their hands to themselves.
Your boyfriend fucked me, smoked my dope, then shopped me. What do you think of that? I can't get a job now.  You bastard. You're no different from Matt. A pair of vicious little shits, that's what you are.
What kind of deal you looking to?
I thought it was you. It's the hair!
I don't gamble.
Good night?
A bit unexpected, wasn't it?
I couldn't resist them.
I loved it blond.
What are you doing here?  You know the rules.
I don't want a criminal for a boyfriend.
Why did you take the money?
What?
Yes, I know that.
I've lived there.
It's against the rules. Dealers are forbidden to talk to punters.
To coincidence.
I was at a loose end. A friend of a friend gave me a courtesy membership.
The point is, they want a man inside.
You don't have to be criminal. A man will come up to your table and deliberately cheat. You'll see him, stop him, and the guy will make a big scene. There'll be chaos. And that's when it'll happen.
Did they tell you to sleep with me?
It doesn't seem fair. You're offering me ten grand in cash but you can't afford a decent place.
And your hand too.
I don't think we should meet again.
Nice car. How much did you pay for it?
I'm off to a little watering hole. Why don't you join me? Relax.
I'll lay you five to one you won't sleep. In this job you have to unwind. Otherwise it'll kill you. I mean that.
What are you, a cop?
And the girls?
I'm off. I need to sleep.
David Reynolds, I'm the Manager here. Sit down, John.
In any case, I understand you've had some previous experience... in South Africa.  You'll find the rules a little different here. Before we start, you haven't got a police record, have you?
Where did you go to school?
Why four? And not three or five?
Where's the magnet?
What makes you so sure?
Ever?
This isn't South Africa. We'd know, because someone would report it. Believe me, someone always does.
Mr Tchai always likes to play at that table, and only with Bella.
Thanks for the information.
Yeah.
What's he doin'?
Where is the key?
It didn't go off.
Well... now what? What do, you have for us now. Boiler?
Fuck that shit.
Remember what we found? Fourteen light years for a fucking mindless vegetable that looked like a limp balloon and went squawk and let a fart when you touched it. Remember?
Hey, Doolittle, here's one. An unstable planet. 85% probability of an unstable planet in the Veil Nebula that will probably go off its orbit and hit a star.
Quantum is up thirty-five.
Rechannel all safety relays --
Well, bomb, we have about sixty seconds to drop. Just wondering if everything is all right. Have you checked your platinum euridium energy shielding?
Thanks.
Fail safe in lock. Four minutes to drop, 22 minutes to detonation. This is Sergeant Pinback calling Bomb #20. Do you read me, bomb?
One hundred twenty seconds to drop, bomb, have you checked your platinum euridium energy shielding?
But you can't explode in the bomb bay. It's foolish. You'll kill us all. There's no reason for it.
You are false data.
The only thing which exists is myself.
Snap out of it, bomb.
It is intuitively obvious.
My sensory apparatus reveals it to me.
What I'm getting at is this: the only experience that is directly available to you is your sensory data. And this data is merely a stream of  electrical impulses which stimulate your computing center.
Exactly.
And you wouldn't want to explode on the basis of false data, would you?
...you may be doing so on the basis of false data.
Ah, what was that again, I still can't hear you?
Pinback...
Yeah. Eight, it says here.
What are you gonna name it?
Come on, Doolittle, give it a name.
I'm coming in now. I'm down by the Emergency Air Lock. Too much trouble to come in the Ventral Lock. Would you blow the seal on the emergency hatch so I can come in?
Hello, Pinback, are you there?
TALBY!
You'll have plenty of time for that, you know. Figure it this way: twenty years in space and we've only aged three, so there'll be plenty of time to stare around...
I can't talk to the others, but with time to myself, I think about back home, back home at Malibu. I used to surf a lot, Talby. I used to be a great surfer.
Lieutenant Doolittle, this is Talby. Lieutenant?
Ah, well, I think I've found the malfunction, sir. I'm in the Emergency Air Lock...
Oh yeah?
What's that, sir?
Oh, yeah?
But see tonight wives and girlfriends aren't invited.
Mr. Sonrisa saw you on the cameras.  He wants you to come see him.
Or we can work on your face with a pair of pliers for a couple of hours and you tell us where she is.
Security camera got you coming outta the stairwell, weapon in your hand, going to room one-oh-four and greasing the patient.  It's embarrassing to the professional community, is what it is.
Nothing happened between me and Tia.
What're you lookin' at me for?  I'm not his next of kin.  Anyway, I don't got that kind of cash lyin' around.
I'll give you seventy-five bucks for it.
I shouldn't do this.  But I got a client lookin' to score some fire power.  Maybe you'll keep your eyes open for me.
If I give myself up in exchange for Sophy, would you make sure she's okay?
Sorry about your window.
How'd you find me?
Am I s'posed to be flattered by all the attention?
So what are you gonna do about it?
Ever notice how cats always seem to turn up around dinner time?
Like following me around and pestering the people I work with wasn't bad enough, but breaking into my apartment--
Completely different situation.  I steal things in order to sell them.  For money. It's called commerce.  But some stranger sneaking into a girl's bedroom is...bent.
How do I know you didn't?
Whoa there, Tex!  We've been through all this.
I'm sorry.  It wasn't my intention.  But I had to see you.
I haven't been able to get you off my mind.
Gold leaf, art nouveau, French, early nineteen hundreds... I could probably fence this for three or four grand.
I don't know what kind of game you're playing here but I'm out because you are a whack-job.
Not that I don't enjoy a good urban legend now and then but what does any of this have to do with me?
I remember fine.  I just didn't understand what was going on.  They never told us anything except what to do.  It took me a long time afterwards to figure things out.
Your basic hodge-podge.
I already don't like the sound of this.
That's low, but this effects me how exactly?
They've lost track of me and I plan to keep it that way.
These girls, kidnapped during the last month and sold overseas to the highest bidder.  The oldest is twelve.  The youngest about the same age you were when you escaped.
Maybe we got screwed outta living in a time when we could sit in a cafe, sipping our lattes wearing two thousand dollar wrist watches while we plan our next vacation.  But the world got a whole lot meaner all of a sudden.  Wasn't s'posed to, but it did.  And it's back to the law of the jungle.  You got your predators and you got your victims.
Who is it?
You said you knew where my fiance was the other night.
How do I know you're telling the truth?
Big part of loving someone's being able to forgive them.
This is not a place you wanna go.
She was a nurse.  She must've lived near there, somewhere, near the...  ...the clinic.  There must be some registry of nurses or medical technicians or whatever for Wyoming.
As long as you're okay.
Whoever tossed this place wants you.  And I'm looking to stay outta the line of fire.
Hardware's too sophisticated.  It's gotta be the government.  And why do I think they're looking for you?
Zero... C'mon, Dan I don't have all day.
A long time.
A fog bank.
Gotta go.
Yeah, I can see to it your winning streak continues.
Probably a touch of what's going around.
Don't believe everything you hear on TV.
I don't see how you cheating on Natalie involves me.
Do guys actually believe their lame, self- serving excuses?
And you were a sympathetic ear.
Then a sympathetic mouth, then a sympathetic--
What happens if you level with her?
And why should she?
She tells you how I've been--
I just don't want Natalie to ever find out.  She deserves better.
For a change.
You tell Theo he's not in tomorrow he can start looking for another job.
Fourteen-thirteen Market.  Get a signature, then take it to this address... By the way, that guy who was in here sniffing after you yesterday called twice already.
Huh?
What the hell is that?
And he loves you back, doesn't he?
You kidding? This is Detroit. Drink?
Sure, I have. But not one with ice in it, that's all.
Jeremiah?
We've got to take this slow...
Tease? What the hell did I do to tease you mongoloids?
Oh, God, how calculating of me to lead you all on like that after you offered me a ride in the middle of nowhere.
Wonder if you could smoke shit out of this?
This is the best thing that ever happened to me at school! Not only are we on again for KISS in Detroit, but we're actually sitting right at the fifty yard line! I dare you dudes to find a curlier scenario.
Well, the least we, his only buds in the world, can do is take him along with us tonight and give him one last curl before he starts serving his sentence.
I'm starvin' and it's way past lunchtime.
I have one question. How could a kid who wails on the drums like it's the only thing keeping him alive even think of such a femmy thing to say?
So maybe we got enough for one ticket. Fuck!
Yeah, she gives you shit and you take it.
Whoa... she just farted.
Too bad we're stuck in electronics or...
Hawk, all I need is one ding on the Volvo and presto! There are my balls hanging from the rearview mirror after she gets back from Cincinnati.
There's only so much trouble an individual can get into till it just doesn't matter anymore, Lex. You familiar with a condition known as Absolute Zero?
Ok, dudes, follow my lead.
Now, how are we gonna do this?
What the fuck!
Here's a suggestion. Let's stop worrying about the concert for the time being and get the cops in on this Volvo situation.
I think we should try sneaking in.
Do you realize the sheer, goddamn, unadulterated, undiluted, no holds barred, one hundred percent pure as Ivory Snow, absolutely friggin' STUPIDITY of what you just did?
Well, let's recap, shall we? You slapped all of us, yelled at me, used my head for a rag, threw me on the ground and tossed our LOVE GUN 8- track under the wheels of a passing semi.  So, if the lesson was that you're a dick with ears and a really bad haircut, then, yes... I'd say we learned it.
Dude, if it were dancing the way Fred Astaire did it, I'd give it my best shot. I'd learn the steps and practice in my spare time. But this... tribal, ritualistic bullshit, it's way-too-spontaneous for me.
Cool.
Don't worry about it. They're perfectly safe. We can pick them up after school. My mom won't be home. It's no problem.
Wait! I know how we can get in!
Well... I still got my idea if anybody will let me speak.
Jeremiah, what are you doing?
But, mom!
I made an appointment with Father Phillip McNulty at St. Bernard's. We're to see him directly where he will register you on the spot.
So, you see if it wasn't for me, me and my friends would be at that KISS concert right now... together.
Poor, Jam, man. Imagine having to stash your KISS records inside Carly Simon album covers. No question, Mrs. Bruce is a psycho-bitch from hell.
Trip, a female gynecologist does not a lesbian make. And even if it did, at least my mom didn't give birth to me while she was on LSD.
Yeah, right. She wishes. Look at that big ass.
Oh, everything's hunky-dory now that the shit hit the fan just like you said it would, you snug sonofabitch! You fuckin' jinxed us!
Simplicity, Hawk.
Really, Trip, can we bore holes in your head and use it as a bong so it actually does us some good for a change?
Hey, kid, that's okay. I don't wanna see KISS that ba...
I did?
Yeeeehaaawww!! This is totally fuckin' curly, man! Thank you God!
Now that's better... but I still sense some students out there... who are AFRAID... just to say GOOD MORNING!
Hi... what's going on here?
Dr. Monnitoff?
Theoretically.
I'm not following you.
Why do I have to sleep with Donnie? He stinks.
What happens if you tell Mom and Dad about this, Samantha?
Why are you wearing that stupid man suit?
Wanna walk me home?
Oh, I... have those too.  What kind of problems does your dad have?
Wow. Did he go to jail?
Where are we going?
So when you sleepwalk, can you remember afterward? Like, do you dream?
What happened to your neck?
That's alright... I understand.
They suspended me for two days.
So, we call them... IMGs.
I don't know. She didn't leave a note. The house is all messed up.
I'm so scared... I just keep thinking that something awful has happened. It's my fucking stepdad. I know it.
Come with me.
Is that a cellar door?
I just don't get this. Everything can't be lumped into two categories. That's too simple.
So how was school today?
Oh, shit!
You're right. Roberta Sparrow was famous for her gem collections. Kids used to try and steal stuff from her all the time. Over the years... as she got older, she became more and more of a recluse... now she just likes to stay up there all by herself.
Ms. Pomeroy... what's going on?
What's "Cellar Door"?
Your mother said that you've been skipping cycles of your medication.
His name is Frank.
I think he saved my life.
Do you believe that the world is coming to an end?
So, tell me about your day, Donald.
What about your family, Donnie?
Nothing.
And when I clap my hands together twice, you will wake up. Do you understand?
People get hurt. I don't want to hurt anyone.
Yes. I flooded my school... and I burned down that pervert's house. I think I only have a few days left... before they catch me.
I think now that he might...
Where are we going, Donald?
How is that possible?
When will this happen?
He's right there... He can read my mind and he'll show me the way out of this. The sky is going to open up... and then He will reveal himself to me.
Donald, an atheist is someone who denies altogether the existence of a God. You are an agnostic. An agnostic is someone who believes that there can be no proof of the existence of God... but does not deny the possibility that God exists.
Whoa, Elizabeth. A little hostile, there. Maybe you should be the one in therapy. Then Mom and Dad can pay someone two hundred dollars an hour to listen to all of your thoughts... so we won't have to.
What's her name?
Why would I tell Mom?
No I don't.  She worries about you.
I got in. I'm going to Harvard.
I... What can we do?
No. I took a year off to be with you.  Of course I care. Don't get angry.  What?
Please! Don't say those words.  Well... as you can see... many of us are devastated by this news. This is obviously some kind of conspiracy meant to destroy an innocent man. And I have taken it upon myself to spearhead the Jim Cunningham defence campaign. But unfortunately my civic duties have created a conflict of interest... which involves you.
Kitty, I would appreciate... if you could wait...
And how do they do this? They FLOOD the house... by breaking through the water main!
Wicked.
Smurfette doesn't fuck.
I heard you, I was just tryin' to scare you into changin' your mind. Oh for Chrissakes, Amber, the woman clung to your tap shoes while flyin' through the air like a Goddamn lawn dart!
"Once a carnie, always a carnie."
I gotta work with these women.
I'm lucky I have an after-school job where I can practice my talent.
Mrs. Leeman?
Oh shit!
Go on! Get out!
Mom!
Nice mouth you got there, Mom, but I -- I'm not goin' through this again.
I hate her!
What?
So, anyone talk to Janelle?
I know it doesn't matter, but on my inner thighs.
Hi...
Here, I'll take it. It's my job.
Okay... well, bye.
Hi.
Say, yous boys been to the Leeman's?
You don't know where this is gonna...
Don't fall for it. She lives two trailers down.
That bitch from...
Can you remember the theme of your favorite pageant?
...Oh, yeah-right. I ain't gonna be in no goddamn pageant! Look what happened to that dork-ass farm girl.
...Today's "To Do" list includes a trip to the Mall of America. We need outfits for the "Physical Fitness" number --
Iris, stop!  It's not his fault. The communal wine just proves too temptin' for some of them.
Oh, there's a parking space over there. Oh, no, that's just a compact. Sorry.
I will if you shut your piehole.
You get nothing, Hank, okay?
Excuse me, Father, Mother, when are we moving back to Tokyo? I can't stand this place anymore. They put butter on everything.
King Solomon was game he gave each Girl his name to number them would make a list that long I'll bet his thousand wives led miserable lives if the king can do no wrong.
My dear President...  read it back...
Now we're on the right track... Put back "dear"... How does it read?
Yes -- why?
Well - what is he now?
Hello...  Yes...  No, not yet... All right...  Goodbye.  That was for you again.  He wants you to call him up as soon as you get back.
You get half mine and I get half yours.
You've got a brain after all - and how you get along without it is amazing to me -- Now, who can I insult?...  Who do we owe money to?...  AMBASSADOR TRENTINO!  How about him?
You're lucky I don't slap your face -- you oughtta be ashamed of yourself. Where did you hear that story?
Why not?  You're the Secretary of War, aren't you?
Now -- how many men you got in your army?
With a gun like that you can kill some of your own men.
We're not allowed to tell a dirty joke HAIL, HAIL, FREEDONIA
If we should choose to chew, we'll be pursued -
Are you getting tired?
That's even a greater honor.
You don't understand.  This is my niece Vera.
This has gone far enough!  This interruption is humiliating, to say the least...
How're ya fixed for ammunition?
Why - er - Mrs. Teasdale - this is an outrage!  This man is impossible... My course is clear...  this means war...  You RUNT!
Why, that's the speech that Lincoln made at Gettysburg...
Guard them with your life... don't leave them out of your sight...  If the enemy gets those papers  we're lost.  If they don't get them, we're lost.  Can't you see what I'm trying to tell you?  I love you...   Mrs. Teasdale, you're the salt of the earth.  They don't come any better than you...
Well -- they might come better but they don't come any bigger... and the bigger the better.  The bigger the betta you've got on a horse, the more you lose, and speaking about horses, why don't you marry me. Come, come -- say yes and you'll never see me again.  I'll go 'way if it means your happiness...
Your Excellency, something terrible has just happened.
I said - I suspect the Secretary of War.
Mrs. Teasdale, I'm willing to pocket my pride and do anything I can to make up with his Excellency.
Mr. Merrick, sugar?
One or two?
Oh yes. You have so many nice things, and so much room.
Yes, and they send their kisses. Would you like your sherry now?
I'm sorry... I don't know either. I just don't know.
He was fine when he left here, and now look at him.
I like doing business with you. You and I understand each other, completely. I know I can trust you. Can't I?
You think you're better 'n me? YOU wanted the freak to show all your doctor chums and make a name for yourself, you guv. So I gave him to you. On trust, in the name of science! And now I want him back.
You've acquired a taste for this?
Don't be frightened. He won't hurt you.
Don't we?
Has the response picked up?
How are you feeling today?
Abominable things these machines. One can't reason with them.
Alas, no.
Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
John, I'd like you to meet one of the brightest lights of the British stage, Mrs. Kendal. Mrs. Kendal, John Merrick.
It's all arranged. I'll send over some evening gowns for the sisters that you select to accompany Mr. Merrick. You'll be using the Royal entrance and Princess Alexandra herself will be there to welcome him to her private box.
Well it is a miracle he ever got back. And, I'm sure, Mr. Treves, under your expert care, he'll have many happy years ahead.
Say hello to London for me. I miss her.
Yyess.
Yes!
Mmmerrick.
I never thought to ask. How can you ever forgive me?
Well, it's a lovely bedroom. What do you call that thing above the bed?
I love the way you've arranged your pictures on the mantlepiece. Is that the way it's done in most houses?
Mr. Treves, there is something I've been meaning to ask you for some time...
You want a dressing bag, John?
...my... home?
Are you sure? Because I can take it back.
Splendid. it's truly a masterpiece. Well, I suppose I'll be on my way now. I hoped your enjoyed yourself this evening.
Yes... Well, I want you to clear up a little mess, a breakfast tray was spilt. And bring up another breakfast. When you've done that, you and I shall give the man a bath. But, Mothershead, I'm counting on your many years of experience to get you through this, Above all, do not scream, do not cry out, or in any way show this man that you are frightened of him...
Won't come out, eh?
A dressing bag?
YOU BASTARD! You tortured him. YOU TORTURED HIM, you bastard. WHERE is HE?
Open up! I know you're in there!
Right! Where is he?
Well... where is he?
Ah! So you admit there IS someone!
WHAT did you say?
WELCOME?
Those things in your hands.
What's the matter?
WHY?
But you LOVED her all the same...
Oh, for goodness' sake!
You're as bad as my father.
Just give me a hand.
And thanks for the Cloak Invisible!
No! No! We are in the spell of the Horn! Hatred will destroy us.
No. Don't look... The abyss will suck away your strength.
What do you see, Erik?
Have you ever seen the sun, Erik?
Well, OBVIOUSLY there's no killing.
A lot of people like our singing.
It's all part of our safety regulations. You see if someone were to get hurt they might get angry and then... well...
He's trying to stop us waking the Gods.
He wants to kill US!
But it IS! Look!
What about the raping?
No. It isn't rape then, is it?
Oh well -- you've GOT to do them.
Let's hack her to pieces.
Who have you been talking to?
Slower! In... Out...
Faster!
Row!
A magic dishcloth.
Weren't we supposed to?
No! Let go, Snorri!
Don't you see, Erik! She wants revenge!
But HOW?
Hey, you two! What's going on?
Yes it does! We could be at sea for months.
ROW!
Hy-Brasil?
Yeah... well...
You coming? You don't even believe in Asgaard.
There was Thorbjorn Vifilsson's wife. You converted HER.
You don't need to feel bad about being sea-sick, you know.
Oh! Who cares? We're HOME!
Who's that?
Get away, Snorri.
Can't make enough axe-heads!
They chase Fenrir the Wolf from the sky...
Help!
Shut up!
You've lost your mind.
It's a tradition.
I was a Berserk for King Harald Fairhair...
But it's a responsibility being a Berserk.
And you've got BOTH axes?
And don't forget: never let your enemy get behind you.
You weren't supposed to see that.
I remember.
Who was the girl you walked off with?
What's wrong with me?
Aw, c'mon, live dangerously. Take the leap and assume someone is talking to you in an otherwise empty car.
I mean, it's okay if you want to sit down here. I didn't mean to --
Rockville Center.
I'm sure you would.
Oh, I doubt that's the case.
Huckleberry Hound! What, are you nuts?
Why wouldn't you think that about me?
I'm sorry I... yelled at you. Was it yelling? I can't really tell. Whatever, I'm a little out of sorts today.
Oh, okay. Well, sure, I'll just...  Take care, then.
Hi. I could give you a ride if you need.
So you like bookstores, huh?
Remember? "And you take on the dreams of the ones who have slept there/And I'm lost in the window/I hide on the stairway/I hang in the curtain/I sleep in your hat..."  Oh, shit. I'm so stupid. Sorry.
Thanks very much. That was very nice of you.
No. I --
Thanks.
Sorry. My life isn't that interesting. I go to work. I go home. I don't know what to say.
I like you. That's the thing about my psychic thing. I think that's my greatest psychic power, that I get a sense about people. My problem is I never trust it. But I get it. And with you I get that you're a really good guy.
Like I wanted to talk to you. I didn't need any more reason to do it. Who knows what bigger cosmic reason might exist?
Well, for the last week, anyway! He's kind of a kid. Kind of a goofball, but he's really stuck on me, which is flattering. Who wouldn't like that? And he's, like, a dope, but he says these smart and moving things sometimes, out of nowhere, that just break my heart. He's the one who gave me that crow photograph.
You should stay.
How could she have done this to me? How could anyone do this to anyone?
I can't believe you wrecked my car. You're driving drunk. It's pathetic.
I don't know, maybe you did kill somebody.
How can you watch this crap?
Oh shit. I remember this.  Want to go?
What?!
Yeah.
It's very late.
Probably.
This is it, Joel. It's gonna be gone soon.
But my sleeping is really fucked up.
You should try Xanax. I mean, it's a chemical and all, but it works... and it works just having it around, knowing that it's there. Like insurance.
Really? Me, too! I don't meet people who even know who she is and I work in a book store.
Do you know her poem that starts "Seaside gusts of wind,/And a house in which we don't live...
I don't know. What if it breaks?
Listen, did you want to make love?
Doesn't sound like me.
Yay. Meet me after work by the old mill.
Look, I have to go. I have to think.
You must have been crazy.
The driver waved. So casual, friendly.
It's them.
Right! She called me an old lady here, too! And I remember, I said...
She's so sexy.
Okay. I wish you could come.
I really should go. I really need to catch my ride.
We'll start with your most recent memories and go backwards -- There is an emotional core to each of our memories -- As we eradicate this core, it starts its degradation process -- By the time you wake up in the morning, all memories we've targeted will have withered and disappeared. Like a dream upon waking.
We can help you through this. Why don't you start now by telling me everything you can remember about your relationship with Clementine.
Yours?
Don't say "we" when you mean "you."
The thing is, Joel, whatever it is you think you have with this chick, once the thrill wears off, you're just going to be Joel with the same fucking problems.
Say hi to Rob and Carrie. Have some fun!
A religion instructor at Columbia. A good guy. He's a good guy.
Stan... c'mon...
To let people begin again. It's beautiful. You look at a baby and it's so fresh, so clean, so free. And adults... they're like this messy tangle of anger and phobias and sadness... hopelessness. And Howard just makes it go away.
Hey.
What do you want, Stan?
I don't know. I just -- there are a lot of really confused people showing up at the office.
The office is filled with people who want their memories re-erased.
Howard, your one o'clock.
Order me a pastrami for after?
It's fine, Mary. I'm happy to hear it.
We can't do this.
You made me have you erased! I loved you. I love you! How could you --
Stan? What's going on?
Jesus. All right, what's the address.
I tried that already.
Howard, they've disappeared again.
She should not have done this, Stan. As mad as she was... as justifiably --
I think he's in a conference. Unfortunately. I'm really sorry.
This book -- It's essential that people read it because --  -- It's the truth. And only I know it.
The voltage looks fine.
Patrick, let's just get through this. We have a long night ahead of us.
Yeah?
I like Mary. I like when she comes to visit. I just don't think she likes me.
But unlike the clockworks of the Clock People, my ticks more accurately echo the ticks of the universe....  ......ha ha ho ho and hee hee.
Well, if the Clock People give you any inside information on the end of the world, drop us a postcard.
You don't?
Welcome, podner. By God, it's great to have you here. It's an honor. Sorry I took so long getting to you, but we've had a mess of hard work these past few days -- and a heap of planning to do.
You're political, then?
Every time I tell you that I love you, you flinch. But that's your problem.
I think she's disappointed that I'm not more, ah, sort of atavistic. She's got some naive, sentimental notions about Indians. I'm sure she liked me, though; but.... then she left town.
Whose fault was that?
But I don't want you to leave. Please stay. We can go to dinner. I owe you a dinner. And tonight... we can... really make love.
You're the best?
That's the very first time in the eons that I've known you that I've ever heard you complain. And now you're tired, poor darling.
Shit O goodness, you won't be thirty for another year, and you're more beautiful than ever.
You were the Yoni Yum girl from, let's see,  from nineteen sixty-eight through nineteen seventy. You've always smelled so nice. Like a little sister. The irony has just killed me. You, the Dew Girl, one of the few girls who doesn't need Dew. I loath the stink of females! They are so sweet the way God made them, then they start fooling around with men and soon they're stinking. Like rotten mushrooms, like an excessively chlorinated swimming pool, like a tuna fish's retirement party. They all stink. From the Queen of England to Bonanza Jellybean, they stink.
But Countess...
Ballast.
Holy shit...
From what?
You been out there a long time. Trying to break my record?
We'll have to re-route through the port conduit to the APU.
What...?
I, I tried to go back for him, to save him, but I couldn't get to him in time. The fire... Have you ever seen fire in zero-gravity? It's like a liquid, it slides over everything. It was like a wave breaking over him, a wave of fire. And then he was gone.  I never told anyone until now. But this ship knew, DJ. It knows about the Goliath, it knows about Corrick. It knows our secrets. It knows what we're afraid of.  And now you're going to tell me it's carbon dioxide.
What is it?
They thought it said, "Liberatis me," "Save me," but it's not "me." It's "tutemet:" "Save yourself."
Do you hear it? Right there.
DJ. The Clark's gone. Smith and Cooper are dead.
Intubate, pure oxygen feed, get the nitrogen out of his blood...
The official inquiry blamed Weir's design for the ship's loss.
I want our best people on this. Where's Miller?
Oh my god OH MY GOD...
Okay. We do it the hard way. Deck by deck, room by room. Starck, deploy the umbilicus. I believe you're up for a walk, Mr. Justin. Go get your bonnet on.
Dr. Weir, you have no experience with salvage procedures.
We've got pressure.
Jesus its huge.
Peters is right, no one's here.
The blood came from somewhere, Peters...
Peters...
I can run the image through a series of filters, try to clean it up.
That's a negative, Starck.
What does it say?
That's the engineering containment. And there's the main airlock. We can dock there.
It beats dying, Mister Smith.
Hold on, what's this "gravitational distortion?"
If it worked.
We barely have enough power for life support as it is, if we can't stop the drain, we're not gonna make it.
Is that your "expert opinion?" The only answer we've had out of you is "I don't know."
I want to know what caused that noise. I want to know why one of my crew tried to throw himself out of the airlock.
If you miss me, you'll blow out the hull. You'll die too.
Jesus...
1500 meters. We're getting too close...
It is now.  We're locked in.
But...
...you break all the laws of physics, you think there won't be a price? You already killed the first crew...
Thank you.
We're past the outer marker, we can engage the ion drive whenever you're ready.
Crossing the horizon. Optimum approach angle is fourteen degrees.
That's an affirmative.
The Event Horizon sensors show the same thing: "Bio-readings of indeterminate origin." Right before that wave hit the Clark, there was some kind of surge, right off the scale, but now it's back to its previous levels.
I don't know, but whatever it is, it's not the crew.
What's the point? I'll just get the same thing...
...I ran the bio-scan with the DNA/RNA filter. The results were bio-readings of indeterminate origin...
Go ahead.
Yes. Yes, Justin, we heard it.
Almost got it.
The safety circuit's failed!
I didn't see anything and I don't have to see anything. This ship is fucked.
I can't believe this, I haven't gotten more than my hand in six weeks and now this shit. Why not Mars, Cap, Mars has women...
30 hours to Neptune orbit.
You can't do that.
The scope is lit, it's right in front of us...
Miller, do you read me, Peters --
That's how the gravity drive works, you see: it focuses the black hole's immense gravitational power to create the gateway. That's how the Event Horizon travels faster than light.
It must be hard, being so far away from her.
Justin said something about, "The dark inside me..." What did he mean?
Those yours too?
You don't know what it's like out there. Walking around like some kind of circus freak. People staring, whispering --
I can only stay for one drink, Ben. I've got to meet with Victor.
You look like an eighties rock band.
Where is Reed?
Good thing it ain't workin... Reed, what are we doing here? This guy's fast-food, strip-mall science --
When have I asked you to do something you absolutely said you could not do?
This is your dream, Reed. You should be the one up there.
You go through something like this, makes you appreciate having the right woman in your life.
What? Come on. She's got a good thing with Victor --
Yeah, well, his eyes say different.
Where... where am I?
Reed?... Sue?
I don't really know. A compound organic-metallic alloy. Stronger than titanium or carbon steel. Harder than diamonds --
At this rate, the infection should be complete in two, maybe three weeks --
And where do we think we're going?
I mean, you feel a little feverish.
Victor's right. Johnny, get to the command center. Close the shields.
Now what is up with that?
We should stay here until we can define the extent of our changes...
Back it down, Johnny!
Is there something about flames? About flaming, that you --
What? No. I'm trying to figure out why we each ended up with different symptoms.
He's right. These costumes are... missing something. I can't put my finger on it --
Apparently I can disappear.
What is that thing?
Uh, we call my sister the invisible girl... the Invisible Girl.
You two need a time-out.
Is that what you call it? "Real"?
Johnny, slow down. Think. You know mom didn't raise us to --
I'm sorry, sis, for leaving you guys --
Reed's disaster. You know, I half- think he did this to me on purpose.
Sir, I've always wondered... Why Sue? You could have any woman in the world but --
Make sure you find Ben, bring him back here. And keep it quiet. I don't need this to hit the press.
Material made from self-regulating unstable molecules. I've been working on a formula for this.
That's good. That's uh... good.
Sue. Your clothes. Lose them.
Reed. How close are we to a cure?
I could get Ben to tap into the Baxter's main power to generate enough voltage --
Remember our first date here...? God, I was so nervous.
You always talked about how you liked the kind of man who could approach you... speak his mind. One who wasn't afraid to tell you what he wanted.
When I walked out, I waited ten minutes outside your door. Ten. Waiting for you to come find me.
I can... make it work.
I found a broken gasket, from space --
Not until Ben is back inside!
Just a little banged up. A couple scrapes. Why?
I'm starting to wonder the same thing... How much do you know about what happened to you?
Didn't go as planned? It was a catastrophe. You ruined the lives of four people --
Abort? Reed, I put my company, my name, billions of dollars on the line, and I will not let you make me look like a fool --
It's just business.
Uh, Victor, I hope I haven't done something to make you think...
What are you doing?
If you're trying to cheer me up you're doing a helluva job --
Brad, can I talk to you a minute?
Brad, I really fuckin' hate McDonald's, man. Ever since they started in with the chicken, everything went downhill.
Tool? Tool for what? We've been going together almost two years!
Something happened to them, mon.
I can't find it, mon!
Well, that's not the way it works, really. And you ate most of your food already, too...
Mom says to clean up the pool.
Brad! Have Mom or Dad seen this?
Why? Because she won't sleep with you?
You are a virgin!
Does Mom know you have company?
Did you threaten this man or use profanity in any way?
Nice to meet you, Stacy.
You know Mark Ratner really likes you. You like him?
Why don't you take off your clothes, Mike?
I want you to know that it's your final decision if we should continue or not.
Mike! You have a mess on C-9!
It's definitely your mama.
It's never too soon! Girls decide how far to let you go in the first five minutes.
I would. Yeah.
That's the idea, Rat. That's The Attitude.
Okay. Tell me. What's the Five Point Plan?
Mark. What happened to your date?
Did you go home and get it?
All right, what you want to do is go to the Free Clinic and tell the doctor that you have sex regularly -- several times a week -- and that you need Nornel One Plus Fifty's.
School.  School is no problem. All you have to do is go to get the grades. And if you know something, all you have to do is go about half the time.
Are you going to ride that wave?
How's it going.
Linda. That girl looks just like Pat Benatar.
Do you think guys find that attractive?
Yeah but they look more sophisticated. You'd probably think they'd be better in bed.
So tell me, do you like Ron? Is it serious?
Does Doug care that you're seventeen?
If he ever calls again I'll say I'm eighteen.
Don't you think it meant anything to him. Even if I am fifteen?
All right! Here's another one. 'The most satisfactory lovemaking occurs when your mate climaxes first, you climax first, you and your mate climax together?'
What's Doug do in Chicago?
God, he hardly even talks anymore.
It couldn't be.
You know, there's one thing you didn't tell me about guys.
I paid for it and everything.
This is U.S. History, right? I saw the globe in the window.
Can I come in?
If you graduate.
You look like you could still be in high school.
It's very warm out tonight.
What do you do with the jackets people leave here?
I had a really nice time tonight.
No. That's okay.
So... pretty nice house you've got here.
This is me in the eighth grade. Did you have Mr. Deegan?
Where's Mike today?
I made a fool of myself.
Yeah? About fifty people I didn't know wrote that in my annual.
Are you ready to order here?
Are you sure there's nothing else I can bring you?
Sir?  This telegram came for you. Actually, it isn't for you. It's for somebody named Thompson, but it says 'care of Raoul Duke'. Does that make sense?
I checked the register for this man Thompson. We don't show him but I figured he might be part of your team.
Well... the manager, Mr. Heem, would like to meet him. Nothing unusual. Mr. Heem likes to meet all our large accounts... put them on a personal basis... just a chat and a handshake, you understand.
But he will be available? Perhaps later this morning?
What's the message? My light is blinking.
The woman who left that message for you sounded very disturbed. I think she was crying...
Naw!
What happened? What did they do to her?
Yeh. The big guy used to be a major in the Marines.
What do you mean by that?
A great town, that Vegas. I bet you had good luck there. You're the type.
Thanks for the ride. Thanks a lot. I like you guys. Don't worry about me.
If so -- well, we'll just have to cut his head off and bury him somewhere. Because it goes without saying that we can't turn him loose. He'd report us at once to some kind of outback Nazi law enforcement agency, and they'll run us down like dogs...
...and we're chock full of that!
That's the press table. Where you have to sign in for our credentials. Shit, let's get it over with. You handle that, and I'll check on the room.
Holy shit! They almost had us there! That was quick thinking.
I hate to say this, but this place is getting to me. I think I'm getting The Fear.
That's what gives me The Fear.
I have to go.
Did you see that? Some sonofabitch kicked me in the back.
Yeah... I thought we might need it...
What limes?
You evil son of a bitch. You better hope there's some Thorazine in that bag, because if there's not, you're in bad trouble.
What tape?
Not me. It would blast you through the wall -- stone dead in ten seconds and they'd make me explain it!
Jesus.
The cops?
NO! Stop talking like that.
What?... What kind of goddamn monster are you?
I gave the cabbie an extra ten bucks to make sure she gets there safe. Also, I told him I'd be there myself in an hour, and if she wasn't, I'd come back out here and rip his lungs out.
Why not? We should get some of that. Just eat a big handful and see what happens.
...grow claws... bleeding warts.
Alright, Alice... you'll be contacted by Inspector Rock. Arthur Rock. He'll be posing as a politician.
Fuck the car. They should make these things with a goddamn FM radio.
What are you doing? You were supposed to turn back there!
Don't take any guff from those swine. Remember, if you have any trouble you can always send a telegram to the Right People.
The password is: "One Hand Washes The Other." The minute you hear that, you say "I fear nothing."
Could I have that, please?
Not my jurisdiction. The city limits are two point two miles beyond the rest area. Can you make it that far?
In that case, maybe she can help.
What?
I will not die because of him!
I got my .38 here. That's six shots and two refills. Downstairs, I think we got another rifle, maybe a scatterer and some gardening tools. Maybe a couple boxes of shells for The Judge.
I have a CB in my truck, we could get some help out here.
Hey! Get quiet or get out.
I think I know where a CB is.
Jesus Christ, I'm gonna have a stroke.
You all sure about this?
Ohhh.
So, what now? Did those things leave?
We're better off.
Come on!
What now, Geronimo?
It's imperative that you get that truck moving.
How are you holding up?
Will I go crazy or something?
He's dead.
Jesus Christ on the cross... Someone make sense.
In the kitchen, under the sink.
What do you mean what?
Open?
Keys.
Let me make this clear; if we stay, we die!
What's that!? Wha'cha say? Huh?
This one will just stun ya, but this one will put ya to sleep.
Welcome back.
Bullshit.
Hurry!
COME ON!
Yeah, maybe.
Nothin' will happen to you. You get on my back, hold on tight and we truck out of here together.
Hey!
Let's move.
Do we have anything else to defend ourselves with? Anything?
Let's go.
Let's wait it out.
There's a rifle and a shotgun here.
Oh my God... What is that?
Shut up! Shut your mouth. You have no idea what is running through me right now. No idea.  I'm ready.
I admire your strength.
I know. Thanks. Just don't tell anyone I have a soft side.
Hey little bear, aren't you going to join the others?
Come on, Frances. Louella Parsons is here. She wants to talk to you, help you out.
Come on, she's an important columnist! What's the matter? I thought you wanted these people to forgive you.
Since we have you on a seven year contract, I'm planning long-range. I'm going to loan you out to Sam Goldwyn to make a picture called "Come and Get It."
Yeah, I mean slacks... and work clothes... and that awful car --
You know what I mean.
Madam...?
Oh my God! Frances, I'm such a cad. I can't go through with this. My wife is in Europe, but this is her house...  her bedroom. I can't ask you to...
Who?
What does Clifford say?
No. Cut this runaround, Doctor. I know better.
...until finally your mother finds it necessary to commit you to a state mental institution. Were you mentally ill, Frances?
Were you a drug addict?
You wrote it, didn't you?
No, no, no. All he wants to do is see the common man get a little representation.
It's already started, Dad... with me.
I know that, Dad, but --
Are you... are you hungry?
It always amazes me, Lil, how you can whip up a hot, hearty meal out of thin air.
How? What do they do for you, Kaminski and his friends? They're all anarchists! Traitors!
Only if you were in it. Are you?
Gosh! You'll break a lot of hearts.
Is it true you're getting a divorce? Comrade?
Okay then...
Hi, Harry. Did you see the play?
Well? What'd you think?
Honest. When you were up there, you were really... there, know what I mean? Everyone else looked stupid.
What?
You know, my old man was an inventor. Spent his whole life down in the basement trying to design transcontinental underground railroads, stuff like that. Well, I was supposed to be his partner. When I told him the smell of his workshop made me sick, I thought he was going to die right there.
Frances...
What?
Oh no...
I know what ability you're interested in.
What're you gonna do, waste your talent? Why not use it to make something worthwhile. You can do that, you know?
Don't start, Farmer.
Harry? Harry, where are you?!
How the hell do you find me anyway?
Evening, gorgeous.
I should've known...
This is another one of your schemes to get me off alone...
I don't think I'd be much good in a war...
Harry, I have to go home. I have to talk to Mama.
No, she just didn't want me going to jail, that's all.
Why are you always leaving me, Harry?
I don't know.
Oh, you...  ...ennh.
Dad, too. I sold the house. I'm a faceless sinner, Harry...
Where you goin'?
Answer the question! Have you driven a car since you were placed on probation?
Have you reported to your Probation Officer as directed?
Did you expect him to look you up?
You're on your way to a contempt citation, young lady.
I live here.
I don't care.
It's okay.
Shhh, shhh. You're not going to jail, Frances. The Judge has put you under my care. I'll see you get the rest you need.
And here's one from nice Mr. Zeiss. He says that...
Nothing. I think I'll just go out for awhile.
I'll have lunch ready by one.
Say you promise.
Haven't you heard what I said?
You're not going anywhere!
Little sister, I don't want you to feel any rush to get back to work. I want you to rest... for a while anyway.
Do I go right away or do I have time to take a bath?
On behalf of the Seattle Ladies Club, as a token of our vast admiration --
No, my dear. You must be mistaken.
I find these initial meetings to be much easier without the concerned relatives in attendance.
Normal. Average.
Doctor, I hate to break this to you, but my mother is a little batty.
Symington says...
I don't know why they even bother. She's had enough of this to knock sense into a bull elephant.
I longed to be with him. But I wanted his final moments to have peace. I could see you were a friend to him.
I am as he made me. In his own image.
I'm glad you finally came to the door. A man shouldn't have to scurry in the shadows.
I have been... afraid. Afraid... they will hate me... because I am so very ugly... and they are so very beautiful
The letters in your journal. That and a geography book.  Your Elizabeth sounds lovely.
Your crime... as well as mine.
Evil?  Do you believe in evil?
Stolen memories. Stolen and hazy. They taunt me in my dreams. I've seen a beautiful woman lying back and beckoning for me to love her. Whose woman was this? I've seen boys playing, splashing about in a stream. Whose childhood friends were these?  Who am I?
What can I do?
What is this?
That's the nature of all progress, William. Don't let your brother sway you otherwise.
Claude rode over there to see if held lost track of time. They say he never arrived.
Oh, do give him here! He needs to be comforted and held!
You will.  What do you want, Victor?
You make me weak.
Brother and sister no more.
I remember the first time I ever saw you. Crossing the floor of the grand ballroom with my parents at your side. So beautiful even then.
I'm convinced. Not by treating symptoms, but by diving nature's most jealously-guarded secrets.
I was just clearing my throat.
Rich old ladies and their daughters?
The entire school heard it. It wasn't something one could miss.
Only you would think of that!
You're making a scene!
How much longer?
We catch a few hours sleep where we can. Usually here at your bedside.
Why? God alone knows what it means. Until it has proven value, it's nothing more than a ghoulish parlor trick. Hardly fit for the classroom.
It is a thrilling direction to explore. Thrilling and dangerous.  Nature can be wonderful and terrible. Science is not a realm for the reckless; it needs a conscience. We must proceed cautiously. Assess as we go.  What I do on my own time is my own business. The same holds true for you. You wish to expand your mind? Fine, do so. You can even join me here, if you like. But not at the expense of your normal studies.
Victor. He was trying to be gracious.
You're awake. I've prepared some broth. It'll help restore you.
Frostbite. Gangrene. A simple diagnosis.
He's dead... She's dead... all dead... Please save me... oh... poor Bill... Oh my God, oh my God... oh God...
So young, so pretty. What monster could have done such a thing?
The killer is still out there.
We should go now.
Any particular reason?
You want to leave?
Alice? The others show up?
Steve said you were thinking of leaving. True?
And it's this place. It makes no sense, but it spooks me.
It still hurts?
What'll you do when you leave here?
How the... did he get in there?
Trouble?
Help you clean up?
It sounded like Brenda.
Where?
Jack?
Why don't we run? Just run now?
You said we were special.
Claudette...
Let's go back, Barry...
This is almost like the one at my uncle's cabin in Maine.
I'll be okay. Holy shit...
You saved my life.
Holy shit...
Ha!
Steve taught me how to use the emergency generator. The town power lines are supposed to be real shitty.
Don't call him.
Are you wet?
Bad enough we got a full moon; it's Friday the 13th. They keep statistics. We get more accidents, more robberies, more rapes, more homicides, more of everything when there's a full moon. It affects people. Makes 'em nuts.
How many with you?
Whatsamatter with you? Are you crazy?
Yeah, follow us.
Unless you two wiseacres wanna be introduced to the joys of hitchhiking, what say we drop this?
If they get over the border, they're gonna let us go.
What about Kate?
What's the story with you two? You a couple of fags?
Who's this?
How'd she die?
Died instantly?
Whewww! Those acts of God really stick it in and break it off, don't they?
I've seen one of these before. A friend of mine had himself declared a minister of his own religion. Away to fuck the IRS. Is that what you're doing, or are you the real McCoy?
Was? As in not anymore?
Who else?
What are you going to do?
What did you call me?
To your family.
You too, preacher?
Good for you. Now, since we all believe we're dealing with vampires, what do we know about vampires? Crosses hurt vampires. Do you have a cross?
There's nothing wrong with this place.
About two hours from now.
I'm going for 'em!
Mexico.
See ya.
Why, just look at all this. You got your kitchen --
We've received no news one way or the other. We can only hope for the best.
Jesus Christ man, that microwave food will kill ya as quick as a bullet. Those burritos are only fit for a hippie high on weed. Pull me down a bottle of Jack Daniels. I'm gettin' tanked tonight.
He comes in here every day and we bullshit. He's used my toilet a thousand times. If I told him no, he'd know something was up.
He says you were scratching.
Whiskey!
Best in Mexico.
Yeah?
Gotcha!
Richie, it's gonna get a lot fuckin' worse before it gets any fuckin' better. We showed our ass in Texas. We killed Texas fuckin' Rangers. They ain't gonna stop lookin' till they find us, and when they find us, they're gonna kill us. Texans take it very personal when ya kill their law enforcement officers. The El Paso police have already started a motel and hotel search for us.
No.  That woman wouldn't of said shit if she had a mouthful.
They're gonna search the van.
Oh, fuck, Seth, that's my only pair!
What dya mean, don't worry about it. Of course I'm gonna worry about it, I can't fuckin' see.
Yeah, like a Mexican hole-in-the- wall's gonna have my fuckin' prescription.
That's what you think?
I'm lookin' scared?
I'm here with you.
In that camper out there I saw a guitar. I take it that's yours.
B.O.Q., south side.  Take a starboard tack out the door.
Can I ask you somethin', lieutenant? How come you're doing this?  I mean, we're kinda curious.
Who's...  Lieuten --
Awright.  How's our girl doin', anyway?
Of course, but there's more --
Yes, of course.  Please, have a seat, lieutenant...
Would you care for a beverage?  Tea?
Did you just have a brain-fart?
Did you just barge in here and curse at your base commander?  If so, I regard that as a bonafide brain- fart, and I resent it when people fart inside my home.
Sir, please... if there's any way to do this without dragging everyone through the mud...
Aw, what is this...
Shit.  Think we're had.
I ain't gonna shoot her.
She made it through S.E.R.E. training.  Got a call this morning from --
Hardly the case, Senator.
"The Lark Report."
I know that, sir.  Ma'am.  It's just that... Beggin' your pardon, Senator, but... do you understand that this involves combat training?
Would I be the only one?  The only woman?
You know him.
Should probably ask him that.
Really don't wanna be captured, el- tee.  Heard some bad things.
Don't have to use it, O'Neil, but it's gotta go out.  Five... four... three...
Time.
Lieutenant O'Neil.
North Korean beaches are the best protected, most heavily monitored in the world.  The civilian population is so propagandized that it acts as an Early Warning system.  Extraction team has to be small and silent -- I'd go with Seals over Delta Force. Problem is, don't want to hold a conventional sub off-shore for target practice.  Where's The Polk?
Spec-Recon.  Those guys are world- class warriors.  And they will not want you there, Jordan.
You're such a ball-breaker sometimes.  Especially at night.
I don't feel like doing an option paper on the rest of my life, Jordan.  Maybe we should just let it happen.
Don't you know?  How they're talking about you?
Still can't make up your mind, huh? Gotta go, Royce.
Maybe.  Though it didn't seem like he was getting any satisfaction out of it.  Almost like...  Did I say he was class officer?
They're more afraid of you.
Made it to Week 10 last time.
At first.
First big night of liberty and no date?  You're pathetic, Wickwire.
Do you, uh, know...
If not, firing will only give away our position to hostiles in the area.  Now how smart is that?
So we got two full mini-tanks, three minutes each.  'Cool?  How much air in yours?
Chief, sir, I don't understand why --
England went out with a stress fracture.  That puts you in charge, lieutenant.
O'Neil...
WOULD YOU JUST GET OUTTA HERE?
Clear.
Maybe we should call the Coast Guard.
You mind?  I'm trying to eat here.
Congress cuts, military bleeds.  But Pentagon's a big place.  Let's narrow the sights.
Sabotage born of economics? Wouldn't be a first.  But is Hayes really going to start his watch with such a public failure?
I'm telling you he's dirt. He's a douche bag, gutter slime, dog crap, puke chunks...
He stole my report! That's my report!
You okay?
My God. He's going after the nest.
Animal, I can't.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Cut uptown, take 8th to 57th then cut up Broadway.
You're a reporter. That's what you always wanted to be, right? I'm happy for you. Really, I am.
Wait. I'm sorry. You're right. Eight years is a long time. Can I offer you a cup of tea?
Blood sample? How close did you get to that thing?
What are you doing here?
Are you okay?
You'd be surprised.
Who was that French guy, anyway.
And I'm supposed to remind you to call him on all of Caiman's expense p.o.'s.
It's Nick! I know that guy. I know him!
Four years. Girl, I'm surprised he didn't ask you to marry him.
What the hell are you doing?
Mr. Caiman...
Caiman, wait. Take me with you.
I want that story, Audrey. Remember you work for me.
Really? A girlfriend then?
I'm sorry about all this.
Make sure they find that nest before it's too late.
When we learned he could burrow his way through the tunnels we realized he could be out of the quarantined zone.
And how should we do that, Sir?
Major, what do you think could have done this?
What sample?
No, it reproduces asexually. That's why we must find the nest. If we don't, dozens will be born, each one capable of laying eggs of its own. Very quickly we could be looking at an enormous population.
General Anderson, the problem was the terrain. If we lure him out into a more open area such as this portion of Central Park...  We should be able to take him down.
They've turned off the ventilation system. They're calling him to dinner.
Three eggs. I thought there would be more.
Contact the military and get them to send a bomber to blow up this building before these things escape.
What'd they say?
I understand.
This is it?
No, don't talk like that, son. We're going to get you fixed up.
You WILL go out there.
God, what an ass.
NO!  WE'RE ALMOST THROUGH!
Fred's no good, Jason. You're going to have to kill it
ALEXANDER??? PLEASE? You're my advisor, advise me!
Sense memory. I see you got to win the fight...
Jason, before we entered the black hole, my instruments detected strange energy surge from Sarris' shiD~ similar to...
He's a twit!
Could you possibly try  not to hit  every  single  one!
What's happened?
You know, with the makeup and everything1 I actually thought he was smart for a second.
And note the sucked in gut.
This is ludicrous.  Why are you listening to this man?  Must I remind you that he is wearing a costume, not a uniform?...  He's no more equipped to lead us than THIS fellow.  No offense.
He's a miserable twit!
Oh good, there's nothing to eat.
Look at that... Will you LOOK at that... They look like little children...
Those blue things ate everybody here?
He always has to make the big entrance.
Commander, please settle a dispute that my crew and I are having. In "The Quasar Dilemma", the Sentient had taken control of the ship's guidance systems, however-
Yes but, we were wondering-
Brandon.
Yes, I know, and I want you to know I thought about what you said... I know you meant it constructively but...
... But I want you to know that I am not a complete braincase, okay? I understand completely that It's just a TV show. There is no ship, there is no Beryllium Sphere, no diagital conveyor... I mean, obviously it's all just a-
Okay, we got it.
Yes...?
Brandon.. Just in case I die, there's something I have to know...
How did you come to that conclusion?
Shit! Go!
Negative, no reserve Beryllium sphere exists onboard.
Hey Commander. Listen, we found some Beryllium on a nearby planet. We might be able to get there if we re-configure the solar matrix in parallel for endothermic propulsion. What do you think?
Listen, I was wondering, would you guys mind if I sit in today? See if anybody's interested in an autograph? Never know.
How the hell is Fred supposed to project a hologram?
We're screwed... We're so screwed...
It doesn't have to be a hologram... Just a diversion.
Who we are. Don't you think they're going to be PISSED?
Hey... Hey where are you going?
We're going to fire everything we've got at him, all right?
I made the CUT THE LINE gesture. You nodded okay.'
Can it be repaired?
You're playing your good side.
What IS that thing? It serves no useful purpose to have a bunch of CHOPPY CRUSHY things in the middle of a CATWALK!?.'
never doubted you for a second.
You're kidding. When for?
Unbelievable.
That's it, It's go time.
Tommy, look!  Those lights...
Right.  Well... Listen, I'm  I'm sorry about that whole... thing.. before. It was kind of a misunderstanding.  I'm sure we can work this out like reasonable people... How's the uh...  ... that going to heal up? God, I hope so, I feel just awful about that.
Yes.
My name is Jason Nesmith. I'm an actor. We're all actors.
Former Commander?
A thousand apologies. We have failed you.
"Deception..." "Lies."
... to make sure craft service keeps those little butter cookies, and plenty of them-
Well, it's... This was a device we...  discovered on an alien planet.  We don't know what it does either.
All right, Gwen, Alex, Fred, follow me.  Guy, set up the perimeter. Tommy, you keep a lookout, make a signal if they come back.
Sorry Guys... It just went off.
Go for the eyes. Like in episode 22 with-
The throat, the mouth... Its vulnerable spots.
Pedal to the metal Tommy...
Let's do it, Tommy.
Unfortunately, I'll never get the chance.  I'm leaving in an hour for Congress to scream like a violated virgin about my promotion.  Wasting my time, naturally... Look at her teasing those bumpkins.
Damn-it!  You've given us a whole new season, Benedict!  And Congress thinks that the British are going to ride right over us come spring. Now half their army is back in Canada.
They don't trust me, that's the truth isn't it?  Sam Adams never did.
What do you think, George, shall I resign?  It's what they want.
Then, I need you.  We all do. Without your victory the men would have no hope at all.
There was this anonymous pamphlet circulated at Congress which says I am personally responsible for all our hardships.  And... that I have encouraged the people of America to make me into a God!  Benedict, it says that I have gone mad!
As soon as the men have good shelters I'll move.  Perhaps Martha will join me this winter.
You, you just need a new flint, General.
Me?  You apologizing to me?
Wil, I want to remind you of a conversation we started just before Monmouth...
No uniforms.  No coats, even?  In this weather?
I am to take command of Major General Lafayette's division and lead the attack.
What the goddamned hell do you think you are doing!?
Captain, I want you to know that I respect your openness.  It would make me happy if you'd join our table for dinner from now on.
What is this?
Have you decided if you are going to join the Virginia Delegation to the Constitutional Convention?
You won't be needing his largess, Rhode Island is already committed to your appointment.
George, I'm sorry.  We all know the army will acquit Arnold...
Washington is perfect.  He's a Southerner, he's a war hero and he's rich!
Oh, come now...
You think that?
No one wants another failure right now, God knows.  But people like Arnold and, God knows, I'm having my fears about General Washington.
That damned Arnold is here, isn't he?  Did you know he lost all his ships?  Outrageous and completely unacceptable.
Understand?  You need to be listening to people like John Adams, and to keep the best interest of the country first in your mind!
You must be very rich.
Like flowers after the snow melts.
That's right...
Martha... what?
What's the point of a revolution if it doesn't?
Leave me, now sir, I am tired.
Not today.
The only way to get discipline into these men is to beat it into them! Fifty lashes each!
I certainly didn't mean you.  Of course you are a gentleman, an officer and a gentleman.
Sir, if you don't mind my saying, I don't understand your history at all.  I mean, why would you want to win the war?  You're not after glory, like Benedict...  You're a slave owner, and yet you invite blacks to fight in your army.
Well, the widow Curtis will bring you riches, position, land, even half-grown children.  You won't have to do anything at all!  You shan't have to do another thing to prove yourself.
Well, I remember a philosopher who said something that I used to think was just another of those stupid class denouncements... but which I now see means us all.
What do you really think of the minuet, anyway?
I always though London was the place to be:  capital of the world, the most spectacular city on earth.
What are you doing?
I've been surprised in an unguarded hour, But must not now go back; the love that lay, Half smothered in my breast, has broke through all, Its weak restraints, and burns in its full lustre.  I cannot, if I would, conceal it from thee.
Cat, that's the lamest idea I've ever heard.
Bear. The Colombians are in L.A. Seems they all upset about their money. That ain't enough, as a bonus, it turns out the yoyo was Escobar's nephew.
I heard in the Federal joints they let you spend an extra five minutes at the glass with your Daddy on Father's Day.
After this one, I'm out, Cat, you understand? This is the last time we talk to each other.
And that's for the airport.
I think I pulled my quadriceps.
He comes up here with our product. He suppose to come home with five hundred thousand dollars. He never shows up. Meanwhile, my sister's going crazy calling me all the time worried about him. Me, I just wanna know what happened to my focking money.
What's this movie you're doing first?
But first I want to know who I'm talking to. Am I talking to you, or am I talking to him?
No shit, come on. How you gonna do that?
I wonder, would that work?  You know who I see for Al Roxy? Harvey Keitel. The man could do it in his sleep.
You know how to write one of these?
That's a nice scream, lady. You oughta be in movies.
You broke in my house and I have a witness to it.
I'm working on a few things.
How 'bout another one for Mr. Zimm. A double.
Assuming I go along with this, when can I have the five hundred?
I don't know.
C-18.
Are you the guy they called Ray Bones?
Where's Leo Devoe? Where's Chili Palmer? Where's my fuckin' money?
Hey, Chil? Since you're goin' out to L.A. anyway.
Did you stop to think what if I had a heart attack?
Karen, say hello to Chili Palmer. Chili, this is Karen Flores.
That's it? That's your movie?
Part of it, yeah.
What does that mean?
She looks familiar.
You don't say any more'n you have to. You say, 'Well, I'm glad you assholes stopped by, so I can set you straight.'
I had to tell 'em something.
Okay, Harry, I'm wrong. You're not the one he's setting up.
Maybe I oughta talk to this Ray Bones character myself. See if he wants to invest in my movie.
You owe me the dry cleaner's fifteen grand plus the juice which is what another, uhh...
So you want to know.
One we're producing.
Martin, I'm not connected to those people anymore. Not since I walked out of a loanshark Operation in Miami.
Very nice...
What's that?
From when? You left Vegas with four- fifty?
How? By taking my money?
But you won't know where I am. I don't even know where I'll be.
Mr. Barboni is a good customer.  Works for Jimmy Capp.
The door from the patio, in back.
Well, basically, this guy owes a shylock fifteen thousand, plus he's a few weeks behind on the vig, the interest you have to pay.
A couple days ago by, people from the airliner come to see his wife, tell her how sorry they are and all that their plane exploded and offer her a settlement, the amount based on what he would've earned operating the dry cleaner's the rest of his life. Leo had some kind of trouble with his kidneys, so they were giving him about ten years.
Hey... Karen. How ya' doin'?
Rough day on the set?
Yeah... that was a good scene. I mean, for a horror movie.
I think it's not horrible.
I don't want to act in it, I want to produce it with Harry. Especially if I help him get Martin.
A locker at the airport? Jesus Christ, Harry. Tell me you're not really that stupid.
Oh, I like him. I just think he's... short. I mean, he's a good actor and all, but I'm wondering what it was exactly you saw in Marty.
Yeah?
You don't mean a movie star? More like a character actor?
Harry... My God...
Why not?
Karen! What the fuck are you doing?!
What took you so long?
Momo could buy it, I could run it for him. Show some Cagney films.
No, you just broke his fuckin' nose instead.
What're you talking about? You wanna be a movie star?
I mean morally. Murray was my friend.
So this means you've reconsidered our deal on Mr. Lovejoy?
When I came upstairs, you stayed to finish your drink. I told you to turn off the TV when you were through.  Come to think of it, I also told you you could sleep in the maid's room.
That Miami flight that went down, it was on the news every day for about a week. Harry must've been busy.
Harry, we spoke with Martin.
Harry -–
Arctic Warrior, Arctic Warrior, Arctic Warrior. This is United States Coastguard Station North Island. Over.
Affirmative, Arctic Warrior. What type of vessel?
Roger, North Island. Please advise pending further information. Over.
Hypothetically speaking, what if we get this boat to Sitka and find out somebody wants it back?
You think the extra strain caused it?
Let's not be too hasty.
You'd think on a ship this size there'd be something left to eat.
Maureen.
Roger.
Probably slipped her moorings, got tangled up in a current.
Seeing as though a foot of one of these fuckers weighs about a hundred pounds, it ain't gonna be what you'd call easy.  Any questions?
Ready?
Nobody just scuttles a passenger liner either.
Fifty million dollars. Fifty million. We gonna let this guy just take it from us? One guy?
Try Wednesday.
Dodge.  Dodge.
The number one turbine's pretty well trashed. Number two runs, but it's way underpowered.
How long, then?
How long?
Goddamit, Dodge.
You gotta be kidding? What the hell we need that tub for, we got fifty million bucks?
Can't you use something else?
You better get down here quick, skipper. I'm on "C" deck. Cabin 400.
I don't figure there's much I want money can't buy.
Could be a fishing boat.
You mean, before she sank.
What?
Go on.
Why not call for help?
Are you sure?
So, we find this guy and make a deal with him.
No cowboy shit up there, understand?
Smashed it up pretty bad.
"The crew have gone mad with greed and fight among themselves like wild dogs over fresh kill."
The what?
Maybe hallucination is the wrong word. It was more than that. As though they were showing me.
No. I think they are, were, just passengers. Innocent victims.
Epps? You there?
What do you think?
I don't give a damn about the gold.
Greer to Murphy.
Call the Coastguard?
It's funny.
Murphy, goddamit.
So what? We gonna unload the gold and get a move on?
I heard that.
Maybe Epps's mystery man had something to do with it.
Say what?
Oh, man.
Gettin' a little hot under the collar, I'd say.
Can't find the shotgun.
No, no. You got leak.
Did I tell you who I ran into at the bagel place?
Give up?
Hi.  Look, I'm kind of tired - I think I'll go to bed.
I have some good news for you, Pumpkin.
It's nothing -- it's just some hormonal thing... don't worry about it...
About what?
What's wrong with you?! Tell him I'm not here!
Here we are... it's mocha mint from Lickety Splits. Oh, isn't that photograph just heart-rending?
Was it Bosnia? I forget...  It's so sad, the tragedy of an entire country eloquently captured in the face of one little boy.  A Soul/Funk song starts up on the radio that catches her attention. She goes over and turns it up.
Uh, well, that's okay - I don't dance, heh, heh...
Hey... so, what brings you down here?
I-I honestly never intended for this to happen...
Hmm.
...wow...
Well they're forcing me to give you a non-passing grade in the class because of what happened at the exhibition... but don't worry -- I'm sure I'll be able to get you your diploma in the Fall!
Look, that's the policy... if you want to make up your own rules you can open your own theater...
Look, we don't pay you to be a movie critic -- just do your job.
Well lose it! And why aren't you pushing the large sizes? Didn't you get training about upsizing?
No.
Hi Josh.
Are you the one who left that note?
Do you want something to drink?
When did I say I hated you?
Oh, hi...
What?... Oh suck my fucking dick!
These assholes are saying that I have to go to Summer school and take some stupid art class!
Hi.
Hey, look, the satanists are leaving!
"Authentic 50's diner"? Since when were there mini-malls in the 1950's?
Does Oomie really like this show?
You know, the green cardigan guy.
God, I think Josh is too mature for us.
It's obviously him!
I think it's cute - look at his little weasel teeth.
"Funky"?
What? How long have you been standing there?
Where are we going?
I'll bet he never jerks off...
Why are we going here? I hate this place.
How about this?
Let's get out of here, this place makes me sick.
I know a party we could go to...
Give me all your money, bitch!
That rules!
You're gross.  See that guy?
You're just jealous.
Face it, you hate every single boy on the face of the earth!
Are you kidding? It's a dream job! I can't believe you got a job like that without even trying... God, I wish that was my job...
What are you talking about? What kind of loser gets fired after one day?!
Look, we have to get these...
Where are we? This is a weird neighborhood...
I just mean it's weird to me... I've never been anywhere near here in my life.
When was this?
What?! It looks totally normal... what's wrong with it?
There's something wrong with every single place we look at! Why don't you just come right out and tell me you don't want to move in with me?!
Hello?
Of course it's a good idea... it's our plan.
So, whaddya think?
I dunno...
What about me? Am I not even here?
Oh my God, you guys! I can't believe we made it!
I'm going to be in this actor's workshop, and I'm hoping to start going on auditions soon. I'm so excited to finally have some free time. We have to get together this summer!
It's really quite something to see you all grown up like this, Enid.  I'd love to hear about what you're doing. I can't help but feel that I had some small part in how you turned out...  What are you studying? You were always such a smart little girl.
Perhaps the "Jam-in-ator" appeals to you.  Absolutely no practice necessary.  You shread like a giant. Just press a button.
Who does?
I'm thinkin' maybe I could let it go...
Punk rock is over!
If you really want to "fuck up the system" - you should go to business school -- that's what I'm gonna do: get a job at some big corporation and fuck things up from the inside!
Go die, asshole!
Well, if it isn't Enid and Rebecca, the little Jewish girl and her Aryan friend.
Yeah, that's good too... the whole record was good, but that one song, "Devil Got My Woman" -- I mostly just keep playing that one over and over... Do you have any other records like that?
Yeah, sure, I guess...
What was all that stuff about enlarged holes and tight cracks?
No you're not! You're a cool guy, Seymour.
We need to narrow this down somehow... we need to find a place where you can meet women who share your interests.
Yeah yeah yeah... Just tell me your five main interests, in order of importance.
Well are --
I - I'd really rather not...
I don't think so...
Wow! Look at all these creeps!
This bar's going to be packed with girls for you to pick from.
Jesus...
I'd rather end up like you than those people at that stupid bar...  At least you're an interesting person... at least you're not exactly like everybody else...
Hey, can I borrow this?
Arrrghhh! Ah Jeez... Christ...
Actually, I've got a total crush on this one guy right now, but it's a really fucked-up situation...
Oh wait, you met him... remember that guy Josh? I'm like practically obsessed with him, but I can't do anything about it because Becky would freak out.
That didn't sound like a joke to me... what, did you write a personal ad or something?
Where have you been? I've been looking all over for you... I've been wandering the streets day and night trying to find you...
I'm going to this stupid art show and I want you to be my date... There's something I have to show you...
Well forget the art show... let's do something else.
Uh... I think there's some root beer...
Where did you get this?
God, she's going to kill me... this bottle is half-empty!
I used to think about one day not telling anybody and just taking off and going to some random place... Do you ever think about stuff like that?
Let me tell ya somethin', Joe... Listen to me, Joe... you can't hit a home run without swinging the bat!
Maybe she's got another boyfriend.
This shocking image of repressed femininity!
Morning, friend, glorious day.
John Henry Patterson, come in. I'm Robert Beaumont.  Firm- I like that, tells me a lot about you-  -now why don't you tell me about me? To get you started, many people find me handsome, with a wonderful smile. I'm sure you agree.  Winning personality, heaps of charm?
Very moving, Patterson; I'm touched you confided in me.  But I don't really give a shit about your upcoming litter. I've made you with this assignment-  -don't make me break you.
Truthfully?  There has been the occasional odd hiccup- but then, as you so wisely told me, I'd never built in Africa.
I know it's your first day and of course you must be tired from the journey-  -but what are you going to do about it?
Go, now.  Such a gentleman. 
-well, of course he kept moving- but he couldn't have been more than ten feet away from the three of you- surely you must have wounded the thing-
Many thanks.  You're Patterson, yes?  Nigel Starling- I'll be assisting you at Tsavo- but surely Beaumont must have told you that.
Samuel is camp liaison- absolutely indispensable- the only man here everyone trusts.
John? I know this isn't the time to ask, but-
What a good week.
I don't really. But understand something- even though it may take me two or three days to sort this out-  -when I'm gone, you'll still have to build the bridge. And I don't want the men to have lost respect for you.
Their den?  Have you ever seen anything like this?
It's certainly the best chance they've had to kill you.
I never thought I'd say this, but I'm glad you came.
I am also liaison between these two.
For you.
Where is it?
Afraid of lions.
Where do you go next?
We'll be very sorry to lose you.  Perhaps I could take you to lunch today?
What do you want with my baby?
Everybody has a choice.
Many marriages begin with a certain amount of distance, but after a while I believe we could learn to love each other.  Think about it.
Occasionally
Egon, I'd rather you didn't mention any of this to Peter if you don't mind.
Please don't say that.  You won't go to prison.
Good luck.
This is Joe Namath's old number, you know. You could get a lot of chicks with this. Just don't pee in it.
Are you all squeaky clean now?
I'm not here to date.  I can't leave Oscar in a strange place with someone I don't know.
Did you happen to see some shirts on the floor in here?
So -- are you making any New Year's resolutions?
Does that start exactly at midnight tomorrow, or could you hold off for a few days maybe?
According to my sources, the world will end on February 14, in the year 2016.
That's quite a story.
Look, I've had it with you.  Get your stuff together, get back in that clown car and get out of here.  This is a city matter and everything's under control.
You're really good with children, Louis.  I can tell.  Why don't you come here and sit with me?
So you see, everything is in order, is it not?
I, Vigo, the scourge of Carpathia, the sorrow of Moldavia, command you.
I, Vigo, the scourge of Carpathia --
-- the sorrow of Moldavia --
I command you.
You've got to do something!
These boys aren't playing around.
The witness is leading him.  Sustained.
Your honor, may I approach the bench?
I got you out of those bad tax shelters.
Egon!
How've you been?  How's teaching?  I bet those science chicks really dig that big cranium of yours, huh?
What now, Brainiac?
That's a thousand million electron volts.
You know, animals and lower life forms often anticipate major disasters.  Given the new magnetheric readings we could see a tremendous breeding surge in the cockroach population.
From where -- Neptune?
Rivers of the stuff!
Great.  So what are you guys working on?
Who?
Who, Ray?
Oh good, you're here.  Spengler and I have something really amazing to show you.
What's your story, Pete?
That's it, Ray.  I've had it.  No more parties. I'm tired of taking abuse from over-privileged nine-year-olds.
Are you all right?  You coming down with something?
Are you telling me how to drive?
She's moving!
And pure --
Now where are you going?
... I thought it was the drug store.
Oh, no, I feel great.  I just ordered some more vitamins.  I see you were exercising. So was I.  I taped "20 Minute Workout" and played it back at high speed so it only took ten minutes and I got a really good workout. You wanna have a mineral water with me?
We're all professionals here, Miss ...
... and then I opened the door again but it was gone.  There was nothing there.
Why would anyone make up a thing like that?
Have you ever thought of moving out -- at least until this disturbance blows over?
Like a used car salesman.
I'm a qualified psychologist.  I've got a degree and everything.  I believe that something happened here and I want to do something about it.
On a purely scientific basis.
Great rehearsal.
I don't have to take abuse from you.  I have other people dying to give it to me.
He is a very close friend.  Do you have some explanation of what happened in my apartment?
Can't you tell me now?
What's he doing in my refrigerator.
All right.  Since you put it that way.
I trust you're moving us to a better space somewhere on campus.
Well, that definitely looks like marshmallow to me.
Hello, I'm Roger Delacorte - the Head Librarian.  Are you the men from the University?
Thank you for coming.  I'd appreciate it if we could take care of this quickly and quietly.
What's that got to do with it?
It's a great game!  You should play sometime.  I bet you'd be good.  You seem very athletic.  Do you have any hobbies?
It's a souvenir from the 1964 World's Fair at Flushing Meadow.  It's my lucky coin.
Keep it anyway.  I have another one at home.
Here's the paper on the Brooklyn job.  She paid with a Visa card.
Heavens, no!  The owners don't like us to even talk about it.  I hoped we could take care of this quietly tonight.
Can I help you?
And may I see this storage facility?
May I please see the storage facility?
Nervous?
Well, just 75 more to go.  What's this one?
Wait!  Wait!  Let me ask you something.  If you like shot Superman with those guns, would he feel it or what?
You're a regular Sherlock Holmes.  Now what do you want?
It's Peter, Egon.  I've got a problem.
I'm with Dana Barrett and she's floating three feet off the bed.
All right.  I'll try.
Yes.  After the First World War Shandor decided that society was too sick to survive.  And he wasn't alone.  He had close to a thousand followers when he died.  They conducted rituals, bizarre rituals, intended to bring about the end of the world.
Ray!  Where are you?  Are you all right?
Set entry grid.
Excuse me for a minute.  Ray, I'm right in the middle of something here.  Can you come back in about an hour?
Well, I was at an unexplained multiple high-altitude rockfall once.
If you guys are right, if we can actually trap a ghost and hold it somehow, I think I could win the Nobel Prize.
You'll never regret this, Ray.
I'm getting high readings near the air vents.  It must be using the duct system to get around.  See, I told you we'd get something.
How do you know?
I guess they don't build them like they used to, huh?
Agile bastard, isn't he?
Hey man.  What is it you're so involved with there?
Did Narcissus die today?  Wasn't this his day to die?
Tribuus... tomorrow.
Where have you been?
Lykas, pick a man.  Someone who will look good.  Jerses I want it built up in the Daily Action...
Being as close, I'm certain you've noticed what we all have noticed.
Forgive me, Caesar, but do two Senator represent the mood of the whole Senate or the will of the Roman people?  Besides, every truce we make with the Germans they break!
Endorse me in public.  Do that and I'll make you rich and set you free. I'll return your estates.  I know you would give anything to be outside again.  Endorse me and you will be free.  Think of it.  What would you do with your freedom?
Insubordination.  To the Emperor... and the Senate.
Caesar, ignore them.
Gods of hell!  This must cost a fortune!  How many days is this going to go on?
And like children everywhere they scream "freedom" the most when they desire it least.  I beg you, please continue, Caesar.
Maybe it'll crush Gaius.
Marcus Aurelius has died.
It's because he comes off as the underdog.
Tribuus, what happened in the arena? Was Narcissus killed?
The battle was won, today, and I prefer to believe it was a gift of Janus, the eldest God of Rome.  God of my ancestors.
I believe we are arriving in an enlightened age; an age of peace that will bring Rome her greatest glory.  Thanks to Marcus Aurelius.
A republican is a man who strives to create equality among all classes.  At the core he's a man who believes in doing what's right.
The Senate too?
Would you support the Senate if they would give you a trial?  You'd have to give me your word.
Where are they?
Commodus, it's we who are going on the offensive.
If I'd ever had a sign that you wanted to rule I would have... no, again, it's my own bullheadedness. Narcissus, I should have adopted you years ago.  And now the Gods are begging me to make you my son!
I see the emperor's little boy has finally caught up with the army.
Why don't we try to keep politics out of the conversation.
Rome is going to pay tribute -- like a defeated nation begging for mercy? Have you told your troops that?
It's your job as a Roman officer to disobey such a summons.
Then give the empire back to the people... the children who will grow up to become senators...
What are you fighting for in here? The good of Rome?  I can end this madness now!  Take the job for the sake of the Gods, live!
You're not going!  You have to stay with us!
Condemned?  Aren't I owed a trial before being condemned?
At the end of the day I was approached by the Golden Pompeii Olive Oil company.  Small, but profitable.  They asked if you would endorse their oil.  We could get some very nice posters.  Make some very big money...
Proximo, if this is her doctor he's an assassin.
Tell me honestly, since this may be our last earthly meeting:  if this were a fair fight where would you put your money?
How much money is involved?
No.  Tell them I'll do it.  But I want more posters all over Rome.
I want another interview with Cos. Tell him to bring plenty of ink.
Let's talk about this later.  Right now we have other things to settle. You and your family will be leaving with a supply ship returning in the morning to Ostia.  From there, Caesar has decreed you be given an estate in Paestum.  It's beautiful; an old Greek town right on the ocean.  Rich soil.  Perhaps we could keep our financial arrangements... although Caesar will give you a sort of pension it's always good to look to the future, keep your hand in the arena... so to speak.
Commodus must hate you.  Free your gladiators and come with us.
Hello.
Are you going to graduate school?
Aren't you eating?
I want to go home.
What?
But could you try?
Where we going?
What is the matter?
Listen, Elaine -- it seems to me that there isn't a bar in here. I mean -- as far as I know.
Was she married or something?
And it's all over now.
Yes.
Elaine --
No. I want to know why you're here in Berkeley?
Well, I want you to leave.
Let me go.
Then you took her upstairs and you raped her.
Is that so? You might marry me?
Well -- look -- don't be confused. We're getting married.
Elaine -- are you serious about this?
Or this afternoon. It's a good day for it.
Well -- I have to see Carl first.
Carl who?
Well, what did he say? I'm curious.
Oh no. He said that.
Are we getting married tomorrow?
The day after tomorrow?
Oh.  Well -- I'm not sure -- but you might try the First Presbyterian. That's on Allan Street.
You a student?
One of those outside agitators.
What did you do to her?
See -- she's just having some water. Now there's no need for the cops or anything.
Mr. McCleery?
What for?
Could I make one phone call first?
Will you bring up my purse before you go?
Give me an hour.
Oh -- yes. The Singleman party.
Do you have any luggage, Mister --  Gladstone?
How are you, Benjamin?
Is there an ashtray in here?
In general.
Benjamin, I want to ask you something.
Would you mind walking ahead of me to the sun porch. I feel funny about coming into a dark house.
Are you always this much afraid of being alone?
Did you know I was an alcoholic?
Oh no, Mrs. Robinson, oh no.
No.
If you still think I'm trying to seduce you --
Well, it would look pretty funny, wouldn't it?
Because I am confused about things. I can't tell what I'm imagining. I can't tell what's real. I can't --
I really don't want to put this on again. Won't you bring it up?
I want to say something first.
If you won't sleep with me this time, Benjamin, I want you to know you can call me up any time you want and we'll make some kind of arrangement.
Hello, Benjamin.
How are you?
You don't have to be so nervous, you know.
Have you gotten us a room yet?
I got a single room.
What?
Well.
Oh -- yes. Wood?
Would this be easier for you in the dark?
It is, isn't it? It is your first time.
On your first time --
That you're afraid --
Now -- do you think we could say a few words to each other first this time?
Leave it on! Now we are going to do this thing. We are going to have a conversation. Think of another topic.
Right.
Now. You say the driveway's on your side of the house. So I guess you don't sleep in the same room.
Well how long has this been going on.
Oh no. Are you kidding me?
Well how do you feel about him, then?
I can't see why you did, unless... you didn't have to marry him or anything, did you?
But I thought you -- I guess you kind of lost interest in it over the years then.
What kind of car was it?
A Ford! A Ford! Goddamnit, a Ford! That's great!
Do you understand that?
Good.
I'm good enough for you but I'm too slimy to associate with your daughter. That's it, isn't it? ISN'T IT?
Because -- Mrs. Robinson this is the sickest, most perverted thing that ever happened to me. And you do what you want but I'm getting the hell out.
That I'm a sick and disgusting person.
Did I say that?
But it's not.
Well I wouldn't. I would never say it if it wasn't true.
Look. Why the hell did you bring this up. It never occurred to me to take her out.
The toothbrush. I got it all right.
Say hello to Mrs. Robinson, Benjamin.
Benjamin? I'm going to ask you something but you don't have to tell me if you don't want.
You don't have to tell me if you don't want.
I drive around.
Nothing else.
Well why do you -- why do you think that?
Don't go on like this. Now if Benjamin absolutely refuses to take her out --
I'm going up to Berkeley today.
Hello.
Do you have a special grudge against me? Do you feel a particularly strong resentment for me?
I am trying to tell you I have no personal feelings about you, Mr. Robinson. I am trying to tell you I do not resent you.
No, I don't.
It shouldn't make any difference what happened.
Are you ready in there, feature attraction?
Dad -- could we just talk about this for a second?
I can't hold them much longer, Ben. You better get out here.
-- before he does --  You're disappointing them, Ben. You're disappointing them.
Is anything wrong?
You've been waiting your chance. You're too much of a gentleman -- that's the trouble with you.
No -- no -- no -- no...
Poor girl -- chloroform would give her a rotten headache... I know -- I had it in the war. Besides, she's very pretty -- not young but --
I've quit.
Like dancing?
You?
Lord no -- charming -- but why one meal a day?
Yes -- yes indeed -- but you are a...  ...a stenographer. Don't little stenographers earn little pennies?
Too bad.
You were very different yesterday.
Oh -- there's no real thing -- it doesn't exist.
Going?
Poor little Grusinskaya! Does it do you good to cry? Are you afraid? Shall I go?
Strange man...
What can you see?
I'm not going... You know that I'm not going... Do you think I could leave you alone here? After that --?
No?
Do you understand?
Can't -- can't you -- Couldn't you come too -- I think it would be better -- for us -- for us both.
I'll give you what you need -- I have money.
Don't do anything foolish -- I'm alarmed about you.
On the train?
What's the matter, Mr. Kringelein?
A drink, Baron -- A Louisiana flip?
The Baron is tired?
What?
Is that too much, Baron?
You're all right now -- it's very late -- goodnight, Kringelein.
My dear sir, I would gladly change rooms with you.
Pardon me, the lady has urgent business here with me.
Indeed you must, Baron -- you must. Humm -- humm, but you must go to jail, Baron, you're a thief.
And the child isn't coming?
I don't know.
Any letters?
I know -- I know -- when a man's collar is an inch too big for him -- I know he is ill.
You must learn as quickly as your time allows -- Believe me Mr. Kringelein, a man who isn't with a woman is a dead man.
I'm always alone -- I have been everything.
You may laugh. Caviar and champagne may mean nothing to you, but to me -- they mean a great deal. You see, I'm ill and all of a sudden I got a fear of missing life. I don't want to miss life -- do you understand?
Her master's voice!  I must go now -- goodbye -- thanks.
Good evening, Mr. Kringelein -- Where's the Baron?
You loved the Baron, didn't you?
Of course I do -- I never knew what money really meant till I started spending it. Do you know --  I can hardly believe that anything so beautiful should come to me from Preysing -- I'll take care of you. Will -- will you let me?
Do you like me better?
You're a very unusual stenographer --
You...
What?
Not too quickly.
Cotton Company --
How nice -- your daughters?
Miss Flaemm.
I'm going to keep an eye on that Kringelein fellow. I'll find out where he gets the money to hang around the Grand Hotel.
Yes.
Can you pay some attention to me?
You're sweet.
Come here. 
Oh, no.
Oh -- ho -- you want legal aid against us? -- The whole thing seems to me to be very simple.
There's a lot of business to be done with the Manchester Cotton Company. They've the whole English market right in their hands. Have you any connections with -- Manchester?
I know you did -- I said you did --
You're a deep one.
I can't dance tonight --
Madam has slept well?
Madam should sleep.
Suzette -- I told you not to bring the pearls. I will not wear them tonight.
I suppose I can cancel the Vienna engagement.
Oh, the sun -- it will be sunny in Tremezzo --
It is not stage fright -- it's something more --
Last night?... There was no applause.
He will be on the train.
Well now, Miss Flaemm, we can talk.
You may go, Mr. Kringelein.
Who are you? -- An embezzler most likely.
My best friend -- poor, Baron -- dead -- just like that.
Oh, no -- no -- not the Baron.
It's a very nice room and inexpensive, sir.
How is the house?
What's the use of asking, Gru -- he is at the train -- He will be there.
Ach! Here you are, Doctor Zinnowitz.
No. No word.
I can make no statement about Manchester at this time.
Next week.
What you need is some relaxation.
What do you want with her?
Pretty as a picture.
Motherhood.
I got a lot of people work for me, Lilly. I can't have shit like this.
Permanent damage.
You want a drink?
Come on, kid, let's see if there's any food in the house.
Right in front of the room.
Well, I'll have to take your word for it, Mary Beth. Here's your money.
Demon! Demon! That's why you can walk on it! Demon!
Well, that's what the law's for, isn't it?
Well, you've got your information ahead of New York, I see that.
Seven seconds. I don't see how you do it.
Here you are! Two rich people!
Bobo wants you to go on to Delmar.
I can't understand a thing like this. It's something you almost never see.
This is some of the finest filigreed platinum I've ever seen. But the stones, no. They're not diamonds, Mrs. Langtry.
It was a gift. It isn't worth anything at all?
You'll give us an opportunity to serve you again, I hope. If there's anything you think we might be interested in...
Makes no difference to me if they're only on commission. If they don't make good money, they're not giving us good representation, and we can't afford to have them around. Ever supervise salesmen?
Good to have you back, Roy. I was just looking at --
That's what we'll do, then. But I tell you what, Roy. Before I hire anybody else, I'll ask you one last time. Fair enough?
Don't mention it.
What happened to your hand?
Not as tough as you, huh?
I tripped over a chair.
Roy, I don't want money from you.
Why should they? The cops are satisfied.
I sat in there with her, I thought, what do I do now? Run and I've got Bobo and the law after me. Stay, and how do I explain?
Just a few bucks.
A job? I've never had a legit job in my life!
What?
Bobo isn't after you! Bobo's after me, and he's goddamn good! But so am I. I'm a survivor, Roy. I survive.
And to survive, my way, I need money. Bobo knows about the stash in the car, so I didn't dare touch it, not if Lilly Dillon's dead. So that leaves this.
You want a drink?
Oh, really? You've got a legitimate complaint, Roy, I don't deny that. I wasn't a very good mother when you were a kid.
A bad mother. By any standards. I've thought about it, you know, from your side, since then. I know just how bad I was.
That money wouldn't last forever. And then what? You'd be back in some other part of the rackets. Another Bobo Justus to slap you around and burn holes in your hands. This way, you've got to go the square route. You could send me a card when you're settled, I could maybe help out sometimes...
Roy... What if I told you I wasn't really your mother? That we weren't related?
I can't. I just left home.
You aren't taking me for granted, are you?
Ow! Hey, what are you trying to do, throw me off my game?
And you never defend me. You're afraid of her.
Get well soon.
No.
You're on the grift. Same as me.
No no! He never calls the cops, not after we give him the blow-off.
Atascadero.
I just bet you are, too. And now you're trying to rope me.
Yeah?
You must have some very knowledgeable friends.
And hello to you, too.
Mostly, because you scare the shit out of me. I've seen people like you before, baby. Double-tough and sharp as they come, and you get what you want or else. But you don't make it work forever.
By God, it's your mother. It's Lilly.
Lieutenant Pierson, Phoenix police. I have a car here.
That's natural.
I grant you, it's a little odd, shoot yourself with a gun with a silencer on it, but it was hers, all right. It really is your mother, Mister Dillon.
Do you have any particular reason to say that?
Well, thank you. And thank them.
With all due respect, detective, you can't go blaming every brutal murder in Illinois on Michael Meyers.
Carter.
Carter.
Might want to stop and think about the safety of your students, Miss Tate.
Funny, we just drove right in.
Think Eddie had something to do with it?
Another historical inaccuracy.
Jimmy, what are you doing?
No.  Wait for the police.
I promise not to run off to Cancun.
You're twisted.
Any other psychotic relatives I should know about?  Jason?  Freddy Krueger?
I can see that.  Why?
You okay?  You seem a little off.
Still wants to move out?
Hey, you alright?
What are you looking at?
Who?
Not a real fan of Halloween humor, Will.
Wait.
I'll pop a Benadryl.
Nope.  Hey, you think I'll win scariest costume?
No!  I keep seeing him staring out his window. Watching me.
Seven-thirty is the costume pageant ... Carving jack-o'-lanterns at eight ... Photos for the school paper at nine ... Then Harry lights the tree at nine- thirty ... I just know I'm forgetting something!
Aren't you gonna answer that?
They did, did they?  Since when did we start listening to the kids at school?
What is it this time?
I've been knocking.  The door was open. Is everything all right in here?
Come on, sweetheart -- what is this? Who's coming?
Kyle's mother might be dead for all I know. Now I'm afraid he could be next.
It was there when I found him this morning.  It looks like some kind of letter or number or --
Halloween.
Where's the baby?!
It was her voice.  On the radio.  It was Jamie.  Calling for me.
Notify Haddonfield's sheriff; tell him we're on our way.  I want the entire staff on alert.  We go to code red lockdown for twenty-four hours.  If he is alive, I plan on bringing him back.
Sam, don't -- let them take care of her.
Yes?
Yes ... Tommy.  What are you doing here?
Miss me, baby?
Um.
I suppose.
I'd really feel stupid if we didn't bring anything back home.
You know what gets me?
You know what gets me?
You know what gets me?  Those guys who went to the moon!  To the moon, boy!
And how were things?
What's funny about that?
You're so low!  Look at that beautiful red meat.  You haven't touched it.
All the more reason to go to Africa.
Me?
Anybody who'd drop an atom bomb on a city has to be pretty dumb.
I don't think so.  It could have been.
If I hadn't done it.  If I'd said to myself, "Screw it.  I'm going to let all those people down there live."
Yeah, Jesus--but wars would be a lot better, I think, if guys would say to themselves sometimes, "Jesus--I'm not going to do that to the enemy.  That's too much." You could have been the manufacturer of that violin there, even though you don't know how to make a violin, just by not busting it up.  I could have been the father of all those people in Nagasaki, and the mother, too, just by not dropping the bomb.  I sent 'em to Heaven instead--and I don't think there is one.
Hello.
Is Penelope in?
Would somebody please pass me the catsup?
Fifty years?
We got to get another pilot.
I wouldn't drop my gun.
You were about to ask a question?
Even this--"Herb Shuttle", you said?
No.
Aha!  He has a brilliant military record, I'm sure.
"Dad?"  Dad.  The boy wants tales of derring-do. Name a country.
Behind a desk for a little while.  A desk!  They had him planning air raids.  A city can't flee like a coward or fight like a man, and the choice between fleeing and fighting was at the core of the life of Harold Ryan.  There was only one thing he enjoyed more than watching someone make that choice, and that was making the choice himself.  Ask about Spain, where he was the youngest soldier in the Abraham Lincoln Brigade.  He was a famous sniper.  They called him "La Picadura"--"the sting."
I saw your father fight Major Siegfried von Konigswald, the Beast of Yugoslavia, hand to hand.
Hid by day--fought by night.  At sunset one day, your father and I, peering through field glasses, saw a black Mercedes draw up to a village inn.  It was escorted by two motorcyclists and an armored car.  Out of the Mercedes stepped one of the most hateful men in all of history--the Beast of Yugoslavia.
We came up behind a sentry, and your father slit his throat before he could utter a sound.
Don't care for cold steel?  A knife is worse than a bullet?
The name will live forever.  It was there that Harold Ryan slew the Beast of Yugoslavia.  Mhravitch.
It's rather a disappointment these days.  It isn't there any more.
You're supposed to get hurt!
Yes sir.  If you can't wake Mom up, I've got double-decker bunks.
I'm engaged.
I don't want that chancre mechanic in here.
He doesn't deserve this!  You don't know him.  It isn't fair!
Now that's what I call fun.
And lots of orange juice--oceans of orange juice.
All right--bring me a side order of Mrs. Wheeler.  Oh, hell--sit down, Colonel. Penelope will bring you some chow.
Which one?
Go on.
And he keeps it in his apartment?
And no one's there now?
I came for my clothes.
Unless she has nerve.
He cried.
He had hoped that someone would be playing it still--two hundred years from now.
Things.
Well--what have we here?  A family.
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.
Testimonials of that sort are--are beyond my range.  I don't do them well.  That's a failing, I know.
He'll play with his rifle, I expect. That will cheer him up.
I bought him a twenty-two yesterday--on the way home from Hamburger Heaven.  And where is the good doctor?  Have you two feathered a love nest somewhere?
Last I heard, his mother was going alone.
An Indian narcotic we were forced to drink.  It put us in a haze--a honey-colored haze which was lavender around the edge.  We laughed, we sang, we snoozed.  When a bird called, we answered back. Every living thing was our brother or our sister, we thought. Looseleaf stepped on a cockroach six inches long, and we cried.  We had a funeral that went on for five days--for the cockroach!  I sang "Oh Promise Me." Can you imagine? Where the hell did I ever learn the words to "Oh Promise Me"?  Looseleaf delivered a lecture on maintenance procedures for the hydraulic system of a B-36.  All the time we were drinking more blue soup, more blue soup!  Never stopped drinking blue soup.  Blue soup all the time. We'd go out after food in that honey-colored haze, and everything that was edible had a penumbra of lavender.
Beautiful, you say?  It wasn't life, it wasn't death--it wasn't anything!  Beautiful?  Seven years gone--  like that, like that!  Seven years of silliness and random dreams! Seven years of nothingness, when there could have been so much!
You're begging him to kill you?
But it's all balled up in your head with death.  The highest honor is death.  When you talk of these animals, one by one, you don't just talk of killing them.  You honored them with death.  Harold--it is not honor to be killed.
Norbert--you come, too.  Let him go, Harold.  Let him go.
Ooops.
Yes!  Yes!  The boy!  One boy!
Pacqualinincheewa root.  Means "cougar fang." Cures anything but a yellow streak down the back.
Good Lord.
I'm going to have to report you to the Department of Health.
There's going to be no bloodshed here.  I know how he'll fight--the only way he can fight: with words. The truth.  Am I correct?
What an hallucination!  Oh, dear, dear, dear, dear.  Oh dearie me.
A living fossil!  Like the cockroaches and the horseshoe crabs.
You hope.
Don Quixote.
We never quit fighting until we're dead.
Can I beg for mercy--on my knees?
Leave the rifle here.
I dunno, boy.
She married an accountant named Stanley Kestenbaum.
For what?
What happened?
You want to join the Harold Ryan Fan Club?  Wear a pink jacket with a yellow streak up the back?
Don't touch me.  Get out of the way.
Thank God!
He's a ghost!
Not even Mutual of Omaha thinks so anymore.
Thank you, kind sir.
Not true.
I don't really know.
Yes, he is.
That's why I'm crying.
I didn't get his name.  A friend of your father?
I keep having this nightmare--that he catches us.
He'd kill me.  He'd be right to kill me, too--the kind of guy he is.
He'd assume we had.
All through the day I'm so confident.  That's why I'm such a good salesman, you know?  I have confidence, and I look like I have confidence, and that gives other people confidence.  People laugh sometimes when they find out I'm a vacuum cleaner salesman.  They stop laughing, though, when they find out I made forty-three thousand dollars last year.  I've got six other salesmen working under me, and what they all plug into is my confidence.  That's what charges them up.
I see.
Is he all right?
A week.  We were waiting for the right time to--
You and Harold are friends?
"War is not healthy for children and other living things." How lovely.
I never knew when to hold it--or who to ask, or what to say.
This is very good for us.
We've got to dump Shuttle.  He brings his vacuum cleaner on dates?
The what?
What kind of a life is that?
Me, too.  I know something not even the police know--what's in the park at midnight.  Nothing.  Or, when I'm in there, there's me in there. Fear and nobody and me.
You know each other?
I'm taking her to the airport a few minutes from now.  She's going to East St. Louis--to visit an aunt.
You've got to fight from time to time.
Chinese maniacs and Russian maniacs and American maniacs and French maniacs and British maniacs have turned this lovely, moist, nourishing blue-green ball into a doomsday device.  Let a radar set and a computer mistake a hawk or a meteor for a missile, and that's the end of mankind.
"Happy Birthday, Wanda June!"
We have this new club up here in Heaven.
Hello. My name is Beatrice. Have you been here before?
You're not exactly the type we're looking for.
No.
Well, actually I wanted to ask about this girl. I have her picture here.
No, Felice, I'm not a cop. In fact, right now I've got as little respect for the police as you do.  I'm looking for a girl. A runaway. I need someone to help me.
What do you mean?
You want a tip?
Now, what do you want?
'Film Producer' -- that should be in caps, bold face.
...the disciplines: bondage, domination and humiliation.
I don't know no Tod.
What do you think of this... ah, shade of blue, Mary.
Mr. Van Dorn, I've worked on the color scheme for weeks. I think it's just right.
Yeah. He's a nice guy. Don't lose him. Maybe we could tone down this stripe a bit. It's a little...
No.
Joanne?
Where is she?
If we went there, would you be able to find him?
Make it nine hundred. That was my best week.
When do we start?
You're not a private detective either, are you?
You won't keep growing at this rate.
You know what I'm talking about.
Okay. Sucking off. Now does that make me as good as you?
Okay, tell me. Why do you live like you do?
No.
How important do you think sex is?
They were here?
Do they believe in reincarnation? I believe in reincarnation.
I is for Irresistible Grace. God's grace cannot be resisted or denied. And P is for the Perseverance of the Saints. Once you are in Grace you cannot fall from the number of the elect. And that's the 'TULIP.'
More or less.
Tod'll meet you at the bookstore at Eddy and O'Farrell tomorrow noon. I told him you were a 'specialty' customer.
Rot in hell, honey.  He's busy now.
Why do you say that?
Did you find out where she was?
I've got a meeting...
This used to be a real city. I was here about fifteen years ago. Embezzlement case. It was always a little religious for my taste, but at least it was a city. With a downtown and all.
Where is she?
Wait. Slow down. A film like this, 16mm, cost two three hundred dollars, sold outright, shown in peep machines, maybe theatres, maybe not, is almost impossible to track. 'Nobody' makes it; 'nobody' shows it; 'nobody' sees it. It's like it doesn't even exist.
What are you doing here?
Why don't you tell me something for a change?
Where'd you hear that name?
You know, it's possible to buy anything on this earth. You can buy child whores, slaves. You can have people raped, killed...  One of the men who supposedly arranges such things is named Ratan. He usually isn't in this country.  How'd you hear about him?
Andy, can you do something for her? Maybe money...
What happened?
Is Marsha there?
I know. Word's out on the street -- word's also out you ain't really hiring anyone.
Jim Sullivan. Sometimes they call me Jism Jim.
God, I don't know what it was called. I never saw it. I only got twenty- five bucks for the whole Goddamned thing.
Who told you about this?
Where's Ratan?
This is from the movie I was talking about.
Here. Take your fifty cents back.
Not exactly...
Jake.
I got a picture here. I want you to tell me where to find this woman. I been asking everybody. Nobody knows anything.
I don't suppose you've ever seen this girl before either? Her name's Kristen, but I suppose you've never seen her?
I don't know.
I'm off that case. He fired me.
To his own daughter?
You know Granville's looking for you, Niki?
I want you to take a look at this girl here. She's been in some porn stuff.
Look again, Billy-boy. This is jail bait. Could get you in a lotta trouble.
You remember me. Louise? Rhymes with squeeze.
I think I should mention, Candy, that Harold does have his eccentric moments.
Oh, well. Must have been your brother.
But there is a family resemblance.
No.
Oh, don't get officious. You're not yourself when you're officious. That's the curse of a government job.
And what do you do, my dear?
What do you see?
Eh, no. Thank you.
Eh, no.
Thank you, but it's an appointment. I really shouldn't miss it.
I'll heat some up. My, it's nice to see you again, Harold. How's your hearse?
Do you often model for Glaucus?
A self-portrait.  But over here is my favorite. It's titled "Rainbow with Egg Underneath and an Elephant." Do you like it?
What?
What is it?
An ice sculpture. It's Venus - the Goddess of Love, the completion of which is his unfulfilled dream.
He's never finished one yet. He has around him every kind of hand tool known to man, but the poor dear has difficulty staying awake.
A little after-dinner liqueur, Harold?
What's that?
What were you fighting for?
Oh, that was fun. Let's play something together.
I think he's following us.
I'm sure picking up on vices.
Did Confucius say that?
Yes. I understand. A lot of people enjoy being dead. But they are not dead really. They're just backing away from life.  They're players - but they sit on the bench. The game goes on before them. At any moment they can join in.  Reach out! Take a chance! Get hurt maybe. But play as well as you can.  Go team, go! Give me an "L." Give me an "I."  Give me a "V." Give me an "E." LIVE!!!!!  Otherwise you'll have nothing to talk about in the locker room.
Maude, do you pray?
It's sinking, Harold. Going over the horizon - where we are all going to go. It's getting dark. "Let each man hold on to his candle and get a light where'er he can."
From the guys who got the matches, of course. 
Maude, I must speak to you.
Don't you advance on me.
Science thinks there isn't. That we are all alone in the universe.
Yes.
Of course, Harold's father had a similar sense of the absurd. I remember once in Paris he stepped out for cigarettes and the next I hear he's arrested for floating nude down the Seine - experimenting in river currents with a pair of yellow rubber water wings. Well, that cost quite a little bit of "enfluence" and "d'argent" to hush up, I can tell you. Harold, dear, stop playing with your food. Don't you feel well?
Mother. I'm going to get married.
I'm getting married.
Love? Love? What do you <u>know</u> about her? Where does she come from? Where did you meet her?
And a lot of time.
My mother spoke to my Uncle Victor. He's in the Army and he fixed it up.
You mean when I'm not working on a...
You liked your teachers?
We are not relating today, Harold. I sense a definite resistance. A lack of true and helpful communication. I find you a very interesting case, Harold, but this reluctance of yours is detrimental to the psycho-analytical process, and can only hinder the possibility of effective treatment. Do you understand?
Why?
Good afternoon, Officer. Bit of trouble here?
Oh. No Boxes. Such a shame.
Well, well. All my family together again. How very sweet.
You knew?
See? He's here. You should learn to believe your Uncle Frank.
It's a beautiful dress...
I... I had a visitor.
Get out of the way.
Nonsense, I...
What was it, kid? Smack? Angel dust? Don't tell me acid's back in fashion?
He talked about Demons, huh?
Easy, easy. Whatever happened, whatever you saw, it's not here now.
They were over here, Professor.
Nah -- he's taken care of.
Remind me why I keep doing this.
hound of resurrection --
What a load of crap. Hell, a week ago I hadn't even heard the word parabnormal --
What the hell was that? An ape?
"In absentia luci, tenebrae vinciunt..."
1958, the occult war finally ends when Adolf Hitler dies.
And as a father, I worry about him.  In medieval stories, Agent Myers, there's often a young knight, inexperienced but pure of heart...
Got tired of me?
It is. You got yourself on TV again.
They're not speaking. Professor Broom had him grounded.
What are you trying to say?
We should go back -- you -- you could tear that door apart --
-- should go back. Now!
Thank you.
Oh. Uh. Hello. I -- I have these. For you.
Whatcha looking at, John??
Helping you -- I just --
What are you, a Boy Scout?
Mmmh -- "Pamcakes." We're going out --
Hey. You: think twice --
We miss you at the Bureau. Abe's crazier every day. And Father's still mad at me --  Come back, Liz. Come back. I --
But it's not true, is it?
That you feel that way about me.
Pardon?
Wait! Wait! Watch the fucking paint work.
Just take it slowly.
The box... you opened it. We came.
This isn't for real.
That's easily arranged. But first, back into bed.
You were holding onto it like grim death.
Well the police are going to want to speak to you. You know that.
Well?
What about Larry --
Wedded bliss?
Back from where?
Don't you care?
Maybe we should just leave --
This afternoon.
No, damn you --
Maybe somebody changed the lock.
Why didn't he want to sell it?
All right.
No argument.
Is it deep?
You're done worse.
Would you excuse me? I think I'm going to go to bed.
I'll be down in a minute
Just a moment. Put on some music will you babe?
Who was it?
Larry...
What's wrong?
Not much fun, is it?
What are you drinking?
Is this your place ?
Why don't you take off your jacket? You're warm.
You know, you're very beautiful.
Of course. Every day.
Take care, Dad.
Yeah.
I have to talk to you.
He's gone.
We're on the Cointreau.
Not that late.
Meaning what?
Can I lend you a hand?
What did I say?
'Bye.
Do I know you?
TURN IT OFF, BARRY.
Public Enemy!  All I'm trying to do is cheer us up.  Go ahead and put on some old sad bastard music see if I care.
I wanna date a musician...
"Thunder Road," Bruce Springsteen, from Born to Run. "Smells Like Teen Spirit," Nirvana, Nevermind.
...But the word "yet..." Yeah, you know what, I'd get the impression that you wanted to see it.  Otherwise you'd say you didn't really want to.
Why would they care?
Un-fucking-believable.  Dick's out on a hot date, Rob's boning Marie LaSalle, and the best-looking and most intelligent of all of us isn't getting anything at all.
Hey.
The band that found me and asked me to join.
Isn't it?
Great!  That's fucking great!  They only asked you to sing because of your name!  You can stick it above the browser racks over there.
I heard you, man.  Don't give me that "what" shit.  You just told them that you're gonna put out a record with them.
Oh really.  Well what about the first Jesus and Mary Chain?
Well what about the new Echo --
I can't go to the club tonight, guys.
Who are you going to see?
Uh.  That's me.
What I mean is, I didn't mean you look young.  You don't.  You don't look old either.  You look just as old as you are.  A bit younger maybe, but not a lot.  Not much.  Just right.
Yeah, well... Let's see... What are you're all-time top five records?
Sure, but is that it for the list?
Well it was a friend's idea, really, and the record release party seemed like a good place to do it.  So...  I should really put a James Brown in there --
Yeah.
Okay. "Dance Music For Old People?"
Good.  Great.  Yeah... Wow.  Rob Gordon.  Seems like a 100 million years ago now.
Fantastic but I'm a little busy right now.  Listen.  Do you want to come to dinner Saturday?  I'm having some friends over and I need a spare man. Are you a spare man?
Huh?
I will now sell four copies of Cats and Dogs by the Royal Trux.
Laura?  Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.  I'm off the phone.
Can I help you?
Yeah.
-- Alright, alright but --
Hey!  Marvin Gaye! "Got to Give It Up!" That's our song!  Marvin Gaye is responsible for our entire relationship!
Have you tackled the Great Reorganization yet?
What?  Gimme a fucking break.  Is that what you think?  That your not big enough a deal for me?  Jesus, gimme a little credit, Rob.
What's the obvious stuff?
I don't know.
Well if you could tell me roughly it would help.
It sounds stupid.
Is it better?
Well.  Sex, I guess.  Is sex with him better?
But not even before, when he was living upstairs?
The sleeping together is better but not the sex because you haven't done it was him yet.
Hi.
I'll look for 'em.  How you doing?
Fine, I'm sure it's in the file at home.  I'll call you when I find it, and then we'll talk.
Is that why you wanted to see me?
Oh, Rob.  What do you want me to say?
Yep.  I might have missed some stuff. I'm so used to some things being here that I don't even notice them.
I don't really want to talk about it, to be honest.
Okay, okay.  I get the picture.
Sure, I understand.  Look, I don't want to take up any more of your time.  You get back, and I'll wait here for a bus.
What?
What about Ian?
Let's go home.  Okay?
You know the difference.
Oh, c'mon, Laura.  Just say something. Lie, if you want.  It'd stop me asking you questions and it'd make me feel better.
Well why the fuck would you want to lie, anyway?
Look, Rob.  If great sex was as important as you think it is, and if I was having great sex with him, then we wouldn't be lying here now. And that is my last word on the subject, okay?
... Like Mexico.  Or Jamaica.  Or New York, even.
You haven't changed so much as a pair of socks in the years I've known you.  If we've grown apart, then I'm the one who's done the growing, and all I've done is change jobs.
You did that deliberately.  You knew all along I'd like them.  It was a trick.
Barry said its done.
Are you going to talk to me, or shall I get my paper out?
What are you going to talk to me about?
Ha ha ha.  Hoo hoo hoo.
No.  Probably not.
Very persuasive.
No.  I don't think so.  I'm just curious about how one goes from making tapes for one person to marriage proposals to another in two days. Fair enough?
So?
Rob here.
What's happenin'.
To think I sympathized with you for two seconds!  Poor Rob!  Laura left him out of nowhere for the schmuck upstairs.  You let me believe that!
Only because it's never the time.  I can't go on apologizing my whole life, you know?
Is that why you came to Chicago in the first place?  Because of, you know, dividing up your record collection and stuff?
You share a place with T-Bone?
I'd like it if you could stay the night.
Jesus, so much for delicacy.  I pegged you for a master of understatement, beating around the bush and all that buzz.
Hi, Mom.
She left.  She's gone.
And after that?
And you must not be getting along too well right now, huh?
Can I buy this Otis Redding single off you?
Eno import.  Sigue Sigue Sputnik. Break beats.  Serge Gainsbourg. Ryuchi Sakamoto, Syd Barrett... What's going on here?  Are you guys stealing for other people now?
Would you like more tea?
Don't know about any of that. Suppose nobody does.
Would you remember his name?
Byzantine?
Good reflexes.
He was innocent.
You want me to front for you.
William Taupin seems to have left his mark.
Who are you?
Yes.
Sometimes I think it's just for something to do.  A conquest to be the last.  Something to hold onto while everything else around you withers and blows away.  Some- thing to replace the love that can never work.
There are differences.
I haven't killed _you_.
What is it like?  Being you?
What is it you want?
What is it?
Aren't you getting a little old for this?  You flunked out of law school.
Just for laughs we raided wonder boy's house.  There was a gallon of one of the corpse's blood in his carpet.  I think it was about then I withdrew his name for humanitarian of the year.
Come on Brenna, your ass is already in a sling, don't drag me into it.
Corey, you _owe_ me.
I liked the bit you did about Baltic chastity belts. Too bad no one else did.
Requiem acer'nam donaei-
How can you know this?
In my travels I heard the story of the MacLeod boy struck down and brought from the hand of death by powers not of this Earth.
I don't understand.
Conor, you and I, we cannot be killed.
It is the truth.
Three days you've laid there. It's time you ate.
Why does he want to kill me?
But we cannot be killed.
Harder!  You swing like an impotent cow!
Please not be touching me, Conor.
If you send me away now, Mara, I'll not come looking for you.
State of grace and all that.
Complete your inspection?
Eat up Dupont.  It will probably be your last.
Equals?
We must talk.
Don't threaten me, Private.
Here.  The hook should go just below the head, where the meat is toughest.
Fish are creatures of habit.  They like their food where they're used to it.  At the top, hiding in old leaves.
Yeah.
Round up who you can and put them on standby.
How are you?
Old habits die hard.  Waitress!  A round of Nitzhic!  Peasant drool, I know.  But it's the closest thing they stock to my side of the fence.
I haven't drunk this much since-
No, seriously.  We used to shoot pool together in Rangoon.
Tasting and enjoying life is the only thing of value we have.  All else is just marking time.  You're marking time.
Run!
What's the point?
Tradition.
Two days ago a Bulgarian national was murdered the same way.  He'd also been in the country less than a week.  What is your citizenship?
It was covered with Mr. Fasil's fingerprints, but none of his blood.
Sure take after him.  Never seen a father and son look more alike.
Nothing to be sorry about.
Ready? The Sheriff's just put two hundred more relatives on the payroll to protect the city against the Red Army -- which is leaving Moscow in a couple of minutes.  Up a dime.
Who is it?
How do you mean?
Remember the ending?  " -- and all is well, outside his cell, But in his heart he hears the hangman Calling and the gallows falling And his white-haired mother's tears..."
Of course!  Roy Bensinger, the poet. Of course you wouldn't know! You probably never heard of Shakespeare, either! Put Mr. Bensinger right on the staff.  How much are you getting on the Tribune, Roy?
I'd like to spoil him just once. Sure you don't want me to go in with you?
I suppose you're right -- but if it gets rough, remember I'm here.
Oh, he's not the man for you. I can see that. But I sort of like him. Got a lot of charm.
Say, what's happened to Burns? He looks sunk, doesn't he?
Well, at his age, twenty payment life, a little over a thousand dollars.
The five hundred? Sure.
But --
Hildy Johnson... Oh, hello, Bruce. Have you got it? Is it certified?
All right. I've done it. Now, are you satisfied?
I can't imagine who did it. I can't think of any enemies I have.
No -- but I'm sure it'll be all right with Walter.
Hildy!
You're Bruce Baldwin?
You see, my wife -- I mean, your wife -- that is, I mean Hildy -- had led me to expect that she was marrying a much older man.
How's business, Bruce?
Well, of course, if you put it that way.
Don't thank me. I should thank you. So long.
Ts! Ts! Ts!
There's a lot of counterfeit big bills going around.
You're barking up the wrong tree, Hartman.
Does it? You forget the power that always watches over the Morning Post.
This is the Morning Post you're talking to!
Hello, Hildy!
No -- Mama doesn't dream about you any more, Walter. You wouldn't know the old girl now.
Done what?
I suppose that's true in a way. I am fond of you, Walter. I often wish you weren't such a stinker.
Was it my fault? Did I know that coal mine was going to have another cave-in? I meant to be with you on our honeymoon, Hildy -- honest I did.
Well, go on and take it. Work for somebody else! That's the gratitude I get for --
It would have worked if you'd been satisfied with just being editor and reporter. But no! You had to marry me and spoil everything.
Don't mock, Hildy, this is bigger than anything that's happened to us. Don't do it for me! Do it for the paper.
Oh! In that case, the raise is off and you go back to your old salary and like it. Trying to blackjack --
That's why I'm quitting. I want to go some place where I can be a woman.
A journalist! Peeking through keyholes -- running after fire engines -- waking people up in the middle of the night to ask them if they think Hitler's going to start a war -- stealing pictures off old ladies of their daughters that got chased by apemen! I know all about reporters -- a lot of daffy buttinskies going around without a nickel in their pockets, and for what? So a million hired girls and motormen's wives will know what's going on! No, Walter, I'm through.
Well, I can, and I love it! He forgets the office when he's with me. He doesn't treat me like an errand-boy -- he treats me like a woman.
Oh, better not, Walter. Wouldn't do any good.
Well, I'll tell you one thing, old man, she never looked at me the way she's looking at you.
You said it.
All right, Hildy, I'm licked. But I'll make you and Bruce a business proposition.
Never mind that. What's the story?
I meant on my grandmother's grave. Don't be so technical, Hildy. What's the story?!
She jumped out of the window.
You know! You've got the brain of a pancake! That wasn't just a story you covered -- it was a revolution! Hildy! This is the greatest yarn in journalism since Livingstone discovered Stanley for the New York Herald! 
Well, think it then, because it's true! We'll crucify that mob. We're going to keep Williams under cover till morning so the Post can break the story exclusive. Then we'll let the Governor in on the capture -- share the glory with him.
We're going to take him over to my private office.  Where's our phone?
Listen, did you impress it on Butch that I want him and his gang here right away? You did? Every minute counts. All right.  Duffy's getting old!
Well, keep going! We want an extra out on the streets before it's too late!
Bruce ought to be back by now. Walter, you're not trying anything again, are you?
Don't tell me -- was she killed?
If it was my own mother, I'd carry on! You know I would. For the paper!
No, you don't! Walter!
When did you deliver this first?
Worried! I was petrified. Weren't you?
In a way.
We've certainly been in some swell jams.
Yeah. What about the time we hid the missing heiress in the sauerkraut factory? Six scoop interviews!
We sure did, but we had to go in hiding for a week.
Bruce is making the nine o'clock train. I told him you'd be on it -- unless you want to write this story yourself.
He's going to have you the rest of his life, Hildy. Can't you give me another hour?
Sure.
Sure I do. And I'll tell you something else -- I'd like a baby.
Sure, I can't last forever. I want a son I can train to take my place on this paper.
It'll be Heaven!
Come on, Sheriff. We've got to get bail.
Butter-fingers! I give you an old lady to take somewhere, and you hand her over to the cops!
Now everything's fine. She's probably squawking her head off in some police station.
You stay here. I'll find out everything.
You know me. The shirt off my back.
Don't blame me. I'm City Editor in name only. You do all the hiring around here.
Say, isn't this your twenty dollars?
Cooley, I want to talk to you.
Yes, shaking hands. I don't take a very good picture, though.
I don't know --
Are you gentlemen all through with me?
I call. What you got?
She looks as though she's going to come to.
That must be the tenth alienist they've had on Williams. Even if he wasn't crazy before, he would be after ten of those babies got through psychoanalyzing him.  Gimme the desk.
Yeah? What did he ever do for his country?
Well, a guy can win when Hildy ain't around.
No, I tell you! Nobody knows where he got it.
Hold the phone!
What a chase!
No, thanks Sheriff. I'm leaving town tonight.
Take your paws off me!
Johnson, I'm going to the bottom of this. What do you know about Williams? Are you going to talk or aren't you?
A fine fair-weather friend you are!
Well, wait a minute, will you? I'm in conference.
Pete, I want to talk to you!
That gives you an idea of what I'm up against!
The Governor gave me his word of honor he wouldn't interfere. Two days ago!
Dementia praecox Oh-h-h!
And you can tell 'em as an afterthought that I want your resignation now!
No -- don't out me off.
Now take that guilty look off your face, Pete -- and stop trembling like a horse.
A sight for sore eyes!
You drunken idiot! Arrest him! The idea of coming here with a cock-and- bull story like that!
Let him out of here, Lieutenant.
And who accused him? Diamond Louis! One of the worst crooks in town! Why don't you arrest Louis instead of innocent people that he frames?
Don't Hildy me! Are you going to let him out?
You can let him out on bail, can't you?
You'll take fifty and like it!
Search me! When I come to I was running down Thirty-fifth Street.
Say, I've been a reporter twenty years and never heard any hooey like that. Where'd you get it?
Here!
None of that innocent stuff, you double-crossing hyena! You stuck Bruce Baldwin in jail this afternoon on a phony charge that he swiped your watch, and you frisked his wallet! Now, give me that wallet or I'll stick you in jail and it won't be on any phony charge either! It'll be for life!
A gun?  Why -- to shoot, of course.
Maybe you're my friend and maybe you're not -- but don't come any nearer. You can't trust anybody in this crazy world. Say, I'll bet I could shoot you from here.
Earl, you must never do that again.
Come on, Mollie. This is no place for you. 
What's the idea?
Are you all right, now?
What's from the Governor?
How much do you make a week?
But you could bring 'em in here! We'll pay all your expenses.
This puts me in a peculiar hole.
Is it hard?
Get out of here!
They wouldn't take it.
Get the cops, somebody.
There she is!
Who? Hildy Johnson? She just stepped out. She'll be back in a second. Who? Oh, Mr. Baldwin. Well, if you'll hang on a minute, she ought to be right in. All right. 
What's he want?
The door was locked.
What's that?
Can I try?
It's true.
I never was.
You couldn't.
Go and ask her if she wants to play.
I suppose they're still learning, that's why they keep moving about.
I did see them. I did.
You're the biggest fibber.
It was great for me, how was it for you.
Root it out Clive... the thought of it, before it takes hold.
No Turks.
We don't know anything about it
I want him. I want him so much. I'll kill myself if I can't have him.
What did he say?
I think it's very sensible in the circumstances.
I don't believe this is happening to me.
Now take deep breaths, and push.
Please yourself.  Let them go, if they want.
It seems to have survived.
He could always make me laugh.
This war's put an end to decent things. I want to close my eyes and jump and give myself for once, hold nothing back.
I wish it could all have been different.
What can you do with four daughters, I asked myself, A string quartet was all I could come up with. They hated me for making them learn.
It's so far way. I couldn't bear it.
I'm so glad you could come. Here we are, all together again.
Drink up, it's party time.
Who's your Daddy!
How much further?
Wondering what?
Why? You gonna do something about it?
What's this?
Fuck yeah, she is. I'd join a cult to get some of that... and the best part is she didn't try to kill the President or nothing, so that baggage ain't hanging around.
Shit, we really need to find some gas.
I'm not exactly sure... it looks close. Did we pass an abandoned school bus yet?
OK, let's relax. I'll check it, maybe I'm wrong. Don't everybody freak out just yet.
Jesus Christ, Jerry.
Don't forget the flashlight, it's pretty dark out there.
Fuck! We are fucked!
What's he so excited about?
Yeah, I'd say at this point all we can do is just wait it out. There's nothing else.
Don't look back, just get in the car.
What are you doing!
Drive through it!
And...
How's about you give me those same directions.
Fascinating.
Worse than a fucking rabid baboon.
I'm sure that ain't the only place he's sticking those pencils.
Goddamn.
You sure you don't need any help in there?
Yeah, my poor baby. It's his Daddy's fault. I mean Earl was a good man... I mean he never hit me or nothing, but one day he just got up and went pure devil on us all.
This isn't everything. Get ready for this... there's a Museum of Murder and Mayhem.
Aw, come on. It will be fun.
Yeah, so how does that fit with the story of four morons with a flat tire looking for a dead tree?
You know what Jerry, who really cares at this point?
Yeah, Jerry, she said some pretty fucked shit to us.
What are you laughing at?
I can't... I can't move my arms. I hurt so much.
Someone is out there...  ...help, we're in here!
Well, don't take too long, the kids are already knocking down the door demanding their sugar fix... I know, I know I forgot to mention that Halloween falls on a school night, so they're trick or treating tonight... I got the joint decked out this year, built a graveyard in the front yard like when you were a kid.
Rise and shine.
Too late. You're in for life, let's move it out Private Shutterbug.
Aw, it ain't crap... it's... cute.  ...and really who are we to judge the artistic merit of the tin-can Mona Lisa?
I swear I've aged five years since this trip started.
She said we look like pussy lickers or some shit like that.
Recover any bodies?
God damn.
Hey, maybe the guy with the tow truck could drive us to a phone.
And I'm gonna help put the razor blades in the candy apples.
For the show. It's Halloween eve and time for our show.
I'm gonna go ask him.
We hit the jackpot! Let's roll, good buddy. We got ourselves a convoy.
God damn it, I must be fucking crazy to let him go off with that crazy fucking bitch.
That stupid hillbilly slut.
OK lassies, I think it's time you get to gripping reality.
I'm with Denise, can't we just walk to someplace, this is getting fucking stupid.
Oh, I get it... I guess you think you're too good for the simple pleasures of Halloween.
I suggest you kids leave now.
Where's Bill?
Grampa... watch the language.
That's true, Otis... not that we're having a bad time, but...
We gotta break it open.
Well, we were on our way out to run a check on a couple farmhouses out on the edge of town... closest thing we got to a lead at this point.
I'm sure there's a logical explanation.
Well, let's go see if the nut that runs this place can help us.
You know, his senses start tingling... when he was approaching danger and shit.
Sounds like a bad idea to me, probally just get in the way.
I'm gonna see if anybody's home. You and Mr. Willis take a look around the grounds for any sign of anything.
Over.
Lila, what are you doing in there? I need to get ready for my date.
It's not so bad.  So, it just keeps growing?
You decide. Today is your day.
No. Don't be. I really enjoy hearing that. You're a terrific assistant.
Thank you so much for accompanying me.
Listen, you're the best assistant I've ever had... Gabrielle.
Is everything fine?
Oui.
Thank you so much. Merci. It's very wonderful to hear a man say such a nice compliment.
Yeah. Okay. Be home around seven. Bye.  What? I'm sorry. What was I supposed to do?
Gabby, what is it?
Gabby, you know I'm trying to sort things out.
The way you are taming him, it sends chills down my girlish spine and... everywhere else, too.
Well, I think...
I've been seeing Johannsen in chemistry.
A little resistance would be nice, damn it.
You what?
Progress!
You still in the market for a real boy?
Cause there's this guy. My brother knows him. Might be right up your alley.
Loves animals. Loves you.
My brother is discreet.
Be still my crotch.
How'd you know where I was?
Slugdom. Sluggishness. Whatever you'd call it. I'm not there yet. I still have many human characteristics.
Heavens no. My work now is... Right now I'm teaching mice... well, table manners, to be candid.
I'm sorry?
Boy, this is good!
It's just that I have some peculiarities, and...
Actually, Mother and Father, you look very, very old. You look terrible.
It'll be wonderful! I'll show you my old stomping grounds!
Darling, did you bring the insect repellent lotion?
Oh, and the sun block?
Did you see that?
No. Too... upright. Might've been a person.
Actually, I just had an amusing thought.
Feral, huh? Totally uncontaminated?
...what is it that makes us human, if not the knowledge that we are indeed human? Think of this poor soul's education as the greatest gift we could bestow upon...
Who is it?
I'm getting electrolysis. It's working, but it takes time. So meanwhile I have to...
Really? Wow! That's that's terrific to hear from someone so... feminine, so female.
Everything's fine, honey. We don't need to talk. Besides I have to work late.
Are you seeing somebody else, Nathan? I just have to know.
Because, you know, you seem so distant. And you work late every night. And we hardly ever have sex, and when we do, it's... I don't know. It feels different.
You remember that from my book? I'm touched!  What's wrong?
Such as my man and how to please him!  Such as making wonderful dinners for my man!  Such as looking pretty for my man!  And I'm writing an article on quilting for the Ladies Home Journal!
I think he's ready.
I'm going to go down and check on Puff. See how he's holding up.
And what did you do tonight, honey?
Shut up! Yeah, this is Lila, cunt. And don't let the hirsutism fool you. I know more about being a woman, and more about the black hearts of men than you, in your pretty little powdered, bullshit fantasy world, can ever imagine. I know the darkness and cruelty of nature, sweetie pie.
Shut up!  I gave you... life. I created you in my image, Puff. I took you from this primordial ooze and brought you into the world of culture and art and manners. And this is how you repay me? By heading back to the ooze first chance you get? I should leave you here with Lila the ape woman. It would serve you right, you ungrateful piece of crap. But I'm not going to. You're too valuable to me. Totally selfish of me. You serve my purpose. But if you had any smarts you would realize that I serve your purpose as well. Life is so much more delightful when lived in a silk suit.
Did I? I tried so hard! I really concentrated! Oh, I'm so happy!
Interesting.
Ugnh.
You did create me in your image, Nathan. Before you I was a simple, happy, complete being, in harmony with the world around me. After you I became duplicitous, cynical, angry, anal, totally out of touch with my surroundings. In a word, Nathan, I became you. Lila has reintroduced me to myself. And, incidentally, what I'm about to do, kill you, is something that would never have occurred to me to do as a creature of the Earth. Before when I killed, it was for food or in self-defense. Now I will kill for revenge. Revenge is an abstract concept, Nathan. And I learned abstract thinking from you.
Boys just passing through?
What makes you know so much? How do you know what Eddie was thinking?
And a fact is a fact.
Are you ready for another?
Put it on the bed. That's the way it's done, isn't it?
Oh, we'll start small... a hundred dollars a game.
I'm sure Mr. Felson knows what he's doing. Certainly you can afford a hundred dollars to find out.
Have you noticed, Bert? This fellow here bears a striking resemblance to you. It seems as though you might have modeled for the artist.
That seems a shame. The night is young.
Will you take a check, Bert?
Make it twenty.
Only when I work.
I like it. It's good for you. Besides, you start drinking whisky gambling and it gives you an excuse for losing. That's something you don't need -- an excuse for losing. How did you make out in the poker game?
Pool.
He drank as much whisky as you did.
You bet he knows how.  You think that's a talent too, huh? Knowin' how to drink whisky? You think Minnesota Fats was born knowin' how to drink?
Wait a minute. Maybe I can help you.
I never saw you do anything else.
Oh. You seem to do all right that way.
Everybody who can hurt me, everybody who can help me. It pays.
What happened to you anyway?
Sarah Packard... Bert Gordon.
Fine.
Sure.
I'll beat him the next game.
Tell her what?
So you figure you're still my manager, huh?
Who's he?
You don't need a drink.
What are you trying to do, Eddie? You beat him. You beat him bad. You wanna kill yourself?
How do you want me to play it? I'm broke.
Yeah, yeah, like a son.  I've known this boy since he was sixteen. The first time I saw him, back in Oakland, I said, "This is a talented boy. This is a smart boy."
I want you to come back on the road with me.
Are you figuring on going back to Ames to play Minnesota Fats again? Is that what's on your mind?
With what?
Oh yeah? Where?
Just like that?
No, no more for me.
And I you.  I think I've heard about you, Mr. Felson. You play pocket billiards, don't you?
When?
I thought we came here to play pool.
Here.  Been an interestin' evening.
Okay, friend. You're on.
You quittin', friend?
Same reason you went: at that hour of the morning you haven't much choice. Besides, I only live three blocks from there. Where do you live?
I know where you live: in a locker, in a bus station. What's it like living in a locker?
You don't look like a college girl.
No, I didn't mean that -- whatever that means. I mean, you just don't look young enough.
Why did you do that?
Oh, you need a shave. You mustn't go looking like that. There's a razor and shaving cream in the bathroom. Compliments of the house.
Don't you ever cook anything?
Give it to me.
A week? A year?
No, I want to walk.
Sarah, I'm going to Kentucky to play pool, with a guy by the name of Findley. Now, I need the action and I need the money. I told you I'd be back.
I got no idea of love. And neither have you. I mean, neither one of us would know what it was if we saw it coming down the street.
Fifty-seven.
Well, that old lovin' horse paid twenty-two forty.  Let's see... two hundred I won from the jockey last night. And today at the track... I got five hundred and forty bucks.  Here, you hold it.
If you don't mind I think I'll stay at the hotel.
Don't wear a mask, Eddie. You don't have to.  That's Turk, Eddie, the man who broke your thumbs. Only he's not going to break your thumbs. He'll break your heart, your guts. And for the same reason -- 'cause he hates you, 'cause of what you are. 'Cause of what you have and he hasn't.
Do you like to gamble, Eddie? Gamble money on pool games?
And them fingers, them chubby fingers. And that stroke. It's like he's, uh, like he's playing a violin or something.
That's what the game's all about.
I came to play pool, Fats.
Let's make it three thousand dollars a game, Fats. C'mon, three thousand dollars. That's my bankroll, my life's savings.  What's the matter, Fats? All you gotta do is beat me the first game and I'm on my way back to Oakland.
That is not now, human!
When you're here, in the city, where do you live?
What do you want?
Will you keep feeding me?  How long can you live like that?  Until it kills you?  Until I kill you? Without your blood I'll go back.
I surrender --
So, what do you do?
Is the hill ours too?
Why, Dad?
It was so real, Dad.
It's probably the solenoid.  Take it back to Gleason's, they said they'd fix it if we found anything wrong.
What happened to you?  Who was that?
I'm home now.
Is that all he said?
Hello, this is Ms. Magnuson speaking.
We were having a little talk.
I swear it was here.
You're looking for life?
Your father asked you a question.
I have school.
What's the story on Jimmy Gardner?
This could be our last night on Earth. I don't want to die a virgin.
You can't be seriously considering firing nuclear weapons?
You still believe in him.
Moishe Martinsburg, Mr. President.
He still gets air sick, huh? In all of this I didn't get the chance to thank you two.
Spunky. He told you about that?
Love was never our problem.
What the hell is the point of having a beeper if you don't turn it on?
Tell her to get the kids and leave town.
Then what?
I'm only saying, it's been what? Four years, you still haven't signed your divorce papers.
Spunky?
Sure he'll listen. Why wouldn't he?
This I can see.
Nice meeting you.
Mr. President, just what do you think you're doing?
With their shields down it might be possible.
A meteor?
How do you know?
It's doing what?
Wait. I have to tell you something.
Really? You don't mind?
Dick-weed!
Really? Ballet?
That is an affirmative. I have victory dance. Mmmmmmm.
Jimmy, kick it! They're gaining.
Stevie... I can't...
I couldn't find anything. Everyone is packing up, they're leaving. Word is a space ship is heading this way.
What can you tell us about the enemy we're facing?
Oh, Sallah! What a relief!
Oh, what?... your servant, sir.
Marcus!  I did it!
Dad?
Venice, Italy!
It's Dad's Grail Diary. Every clue he ever followed. Every discovery he made. A complete record of his search for the Holy Grail. This is his whole life. Why would he have sent this to me?
The present city of Iskenderun is built on its ruins. Marcus -- you remember what the Grail Tablet said. "Across the desert and through the mountain to the Canyon of the Crescent Moon."  But where exactly?
Marcus!
Henry, the pen --
Tell me, what's going to happen when we get to Venice?
Are you expected?
"Where the cup that holds the blood of Jesus Christ resides forever."
An old man's dream.
Hard to resist, isn't it? The Holy Grail's final resting place described in detail!
I'm through!
The Ark of the Covenant.
It must be one of these...
I said go around!
How did you get here?
Is that what you think of me? I believe in the Grail, not the Swastika.
Elsa. Elsa don't. Elsa. Elsa. Give me your other hand, honey. I can't hold you.
It is you Junior!
Oh, it breaks the heart.
Alexandretta.  It's a great moment in Henry's life. He turns aside, lost to himself for a moment, then turns to Indy with joy.
If only I could have been with you.
You didn't, did you?  You didn't bring it, did you?
She ransacked her own room and I fell for it. How did you know she was a Nazi?
Let's try and get these ropes loose. We've got to get to Marcus before the Nazis do!
And the chair.
What?
Stop!
Yes! The only thing that matters is the Grail.
You know, sharing your adventures is an interesting experience.
We didn't talk. We never talked.
Dad, are we hit?!
Nice landing.
Those people are trying to kill us!
What do you think you're doing?! Get down!
Dad?
Dad?!
Junior, give me your other hand! I can't hold on!!
What did you find, Junior?
The last of three brothers who swore an oath to find the Grail and to guard it.
I'm going after those horses.
Ask yourself, why do you seek the Cup of Christ? Is it for His glory, or for yours?
Interested in local curios?
Rather bizarre menu, wouldn't you say?
Who?
Miss Scott, you're not making any sense.
Their stories are just fear and folklore.
The newspapers exaggerated the incident.
You understand what he tells us?
What's that?
Indy, they make our plane crash? To get you here?
I ride with you, Indy?
Next time I flatten him! Did you see his eyes?
There were five stones in the beginning. Over the centuries they were dispersed by wars, sold off by thieves like you...
That's far enough!
Give me the stones!
But why would the Maharajah take this sacred stone?
Listen, we just met for crissake! I'm not that kind of girl!
What'd he say?
God, I am starving, but I can't eat this...
Hey, Willie -- I think you better get out now.
Can you move your arm?
Yeah, but he's got to be dead and buried for a couple of thousand years.  Fortune and glory...
The drawing shows a priest named Sankara who lived centuries ago.
Any more complaints?
Primitive sexual practices?
You're dying to come into my room, aren't you?
Too proud to admit you're crazy about me, Dr. Jones?
We'll see who gives in first -- I'll leave my door open.
Five minutes... you'll be back over here in five minutes...
WILLIE?!
There's a hole! I found a square hole!
Let's go! Let's get out of here!
Wait -- what're you doing?
Down? Down there?! Are you crazy!
Let her go! Our only chance is outrunning them!
Anymore ideas...?
The last Sankara Stone.
This is the first time anybody ever cried when I left.
Figures...
Where are you,...Al?
Try me.
Al.
Your name is Al...
No...no...it's nothing.. Rehearsing a play...  What light through yonder window breaks...It is Al... and he's in my head.
Where are we? We're on the street. We're walking down the street. We're talking to ourselves. People are staring at us.
Somebody's been here.
I know...it sounds insane.
Of course you do!
You're not crazy. Don't...wait a minute, just let me explain.
Why he's argumentative?
You'll be alive.
What was that?
You weren't listening!
No they won't.
I'll talk to them.
What's that?
What do I do?
I wouldn't say that.
Door's locked.
Like the guys that attacked us.
Black suits and helmets.
That's not a good idea.
Who?...  Wait a minute! I'm no agent, secret or otherwise. And..I'm alone.
You mean...just leave.
What about money?
What's wrong with how I carry myself.
Oh yeah, to what?
Eating sushi?
Holy shit!
Swim.
You eat it. You know what this stuff tastes like?
What is it?
You're beautiful..
She doesn't seem to understand.
What happened?
Without your pants.
Not that tie with that coat.
Who are they? Stay on them, will you. How can we find out...Wait. The glasses.
Which one?
They're all in it.
Voice stress analyzer.
What is it, your charm?
You're doing great with her.
She's got the most beautiful...s
Bingo.
Better. I found Ryuji.
Osaka.
On what?
Where are you going?
Relax. Make your mind a blank.
One of your instincts?
What are you doing?
He was with Gruner!
What was it? What'd I say?
Then, why'd he lead us here.
Are you alright?
Aim just in front of his face.
Dieter!
Do something.
Gimme a minute.
Dieter asked where I was. He expected me here. Maybe someone was assigned to bring me here.
She is beautiful.
She's so lovely. It's all my fault...I was wrong.
I don't know how we're gonna get out of this, but we will, somehow.
Don't worry, I owe you a lot. I'm not gonna let us rot here. I'm gonna find us a way out.
In a way, we're like brothers... I can't have her. I want you to.
You just got a Mickey.
Not that truth!
Doesn't matter.
I'm against it.
I knew you were trouble.
They have stolen state property.
If there is a POD inside him, We'll find it, and bring it out for study.
What Job?
Who is your friend?
That crazy guy?
Yes?
...Foreign service.
What brings you here?
And...you know Jan Gruner?
It may have been affected.
When you remember...
Fine. You look fine.
We're here.
Don't you want to get out?
What do you want?
The poet...something he said...
Dinner...tonight.
And you?
Can I help?
Joe! What happened to you?
Why did you stay with me?
Your friends, did they ask about me?
This business is over.
You know where he went?
You don't believe me.
This boat doesn't go anywhere. Just toots around the Inland Sea.
Now what?
Wait a minute! How'd you know Dieter was coming here?
Why'd you ask him.
Chiang Cho?
Looks like they can. What did they do?
Now what?
What? Oh, about Dieter, Yes. It was him. Gruner works for him.
Don't blame yourself, I didn't have to come along.
I encouraged you to come here. My fault as much as yours.
Don't worry.
Kiss her you fool.
Who are you? Who do you work for?
It wasn't me. It was him.
Riuji?
What is it?
Yeah...I have to get away.
It's alright.
It will be fine. You have another.
Mom...what are you doing here?
This the only spare?
The other working.
Screw the PEM...What about Al...
Look, nobody knows we did it.
Hey, baby. What's wrong?
Where?
I don't know what he was thinking.
When's the air date?
What was that about?
Yeah. Yeah, sure. I'll see if I can find him. Hold on...  Yeah, Don's looking for you...
Since when has the paragon of investigative journalism allowed lawyers to determine the news content on "60 Minutes"?
You are a fanatic. An anarchist. You know that? If we can't have a whole show, then I want half a show rather than no show. But oh, no, not you. You won't be satisfied unless you're putting the company at risk!
And what are you implying?
You think I put that bullet in the mailbox myself...?
That bullet was for a .38 caliber. Do you own a .38?
Do you have a history of emotional problems, Mr. Wigand?
I'm gonna do a follow-up.
Shall I send for coffee? Sorry I'm late.
No, only that we would hold the story until it was safe for him...
Is CBS corporate telling CBS News do not go to air with this story?
Well, until you do, all I can tell you is what you already know... they will not air an interview.
Here's how it works. You ask me questions. I tell you if you're wrong.
Why?
Why? Who said?
There's a severance agreement... It includes cash payouts over time and continuing medical coverage...  Sure you don't need anything?
I don't think I can do this... I want to stand by my husband... I really do, Jeffrey. But I don't think I can do this anymore. I am so sorry...
No, Bergman... B.E.R.G.M.A.N.... I'm a producer with "60 Minutes"...
Will independent sources corroborate that?
Let me see this... No, 'cause I gotta know where you're going at all times.
Jeffrey Wigand...
From my perspective, what's been going on and what I've been doing is ridiculous. It's half-measures.
Is it too late?
Alright?
We're there.
...come in earlier on Mike's Marine barracks line when he's talking to Sheikh Mussawi...
He referred to this... the Seven Dwarfs...
Well, it isn't "cigarettes are bad for you"...
Okay, let's look through the looking glass the other way...
Lowell.
Lowell!
Did I get you up?
Mike... in my...
Please to explain, why I should agree to interview... with pro-Zionist American media?
How do you like your coffee? Black?
...protect your sources...! You screwed me! You sold me out!
C'mere. I want to talk to you.
...and swore under oath that they know nothing about addiction, disease...
Okay, so, here you are... you go to work for tobacco.  You come from corporate cultures where research, really, creative thinking, these are core values. You go to tobacco... Tobacco is a sales culture. Market and sell enormous volume. Go to a lot of golf tournaments. The hell with everything else.  What are you doing? Why are you working for "tobacco" in the first place?
I've always thought of myself... as a man of science. That's what's wrong with it.
I drink. A couple of occasions more than I should have.  I was cited for shoplifting once. But it was a mistake...  I pushed Liane one time. We were both stressed out because of the pressure. She went to her mother's.  I got fired because when I get angry I have difficulty censoring myself. And I don't like to be pushed around!
I believe that? Yes, I believe that.
Yes.
Excuse me. Yeah...
Liane, this is a preliminary...  You didn't tell her we were taping? What did she think she was coming to New York for?
I called Richard Scruggs in Mississippi...
...I was young. I was young... confused... We didn't handle it the right way...
Yes. Did you lie about being on the American Judo Team in the Olympics?
That's not the fucking point, whether you told the truth or not! Hello...?
You fought for me...?!  ...you manipulated me... into where I am now... staring at the Brown & Williamson Building. It's all dark. Except the 10th floor! That's the legal department. That's where they fuck with my life!
Where are you, anyway?
You try and have a good time.
We have a couple. One's hers, one's mine. Everybody uses a different name.  Modern marriage.  How's Liane?
Hold on a minute, Lowell...  ...somebody... may be following me. I don't know. They came on the property...
Well, no, look... I mean, there was a footprint. Forget it. It's probably not important at all.  You know, I got a job now. I'm teaching high school. Japanese and Chemistry.  So, what were you calling about?
Jeff Wigand, Michael Moore.
Now, they tried to get the Mississippi Court to honor it, but the judge threw it out...  However, for you, there is a more perilous effect to the Kentucky gag order...
"I would bet on it."
Jail?
Jeffrey says exactly what's on his mind. Most people consider what they're saying... social skills... Jeffrey just charges right ahead.  Now, I know you understood the nature of the confidentiality portion of your severance agreement with Brown & Williamson, Jeff...
Okay.  I don't believe you can maintain corporate integrity without confidentiality agreements. I was paid well for my work. The health and welfare benefits are good. The severance package is fair. I have no intention of violating my confidentiality agreement and disclosing that which I said I wouldn't.
Baby. You are so HOT!
Course I can't do much "wriggling" if you tie me up like that again. Massey -- this is one bad bad little girl.
And how is Mrs. Reiser?
So she's uh, flourishing?
I... uh guess congratulations are in order.
Harvard? Whoa, Daddy!
Well -- I, uh, that is to say Mr. Dumbarton -- would like you to uh, neutralize a, uh, business associate by the name of Marylin Rexroth Doyle Massey uh Dumbart -- uh, Massey.
You're in a rush.
Well, actually, all whores worship the dollar, if you want to get technical.
She got absolutely nothing. Zero. Zip.
Not this one. Not unless her HMO covers plastic surgery, which, incidentally, she does not need.
I don't need it.
Why in God's name would I want...?
It was a gift from a client.
Botox. Christ. We had aspirations when we were in college.
You were going to be a Cardiac Surgeon. I was going to clerk for the Supreme Court.
You're in check.
He's the wrong man.
I'm sorry to hear that. But you weren't close, were you?
What is your husband's profession?
So who'd you hire?
I begged you to have a baby!
You're vulnerable.
Well. He said to "make the house mine."
It sounded like a bell.
How nice.
Not yet.
No.
What is it you're after, Miles?
He'll regret this.
Getting married.
It has bones. Be sure to swallow one.
To victory.
No. Just to comfort you, and appreciate you --
Yes? Marylin?
You have wonderful art. I love that lithograph. Hockney?
Is that you?
Oh. And that is -- mom?
I'm sorry Miles. You shouldn't listen to me. I'm sure you have a very fulfilling life. I'd better go. I'm depressing.
No... That wasn't right. I want YOU to be MY wife.
Yes. I am. What else could those words mean? I believe we belong together and we can make one another happy. And we should be happy because happiness is better than the alternative which is -- just jump in any old time, Marylin. You have more experience at this than I do.
I don't have a ring!
But?
Here's my card. Spend as much as you want. We get mileage.
I'm reporting you to the IRS.
STUFF.  Got a light?
Arty Farty stuff.  Lithographs and pre Castro Cubans. Watches and mileage on private jets. Stuff, Miles. Stuff you get from grateful clients.
It's a no go, Joe.
Hard to believe this is the way it will end up for us.
But then -- I guess -- something inside me died when I realized that you'd hired a goon to kill me.
You wounded me first, Marylin.
Income tax evasion?
Hello, Rex.
Do you think he set me up? Do you think that was his intention?
I don't know what his game is. He dismissed every one of Ruth's proposals. And Sarah, we weren't unreasonable.
Nothing specific, but I'll have my own place soon.
Is this Ming?
-- is not a challenge. I need something I can sink my teeth into, professionally speaking.
Wait. I know you.
I'm sorry, Mr. Massey, but I felt certain you'd want to know -- Marylin Rexroth wants to see you.
Why not a hundred and fifty percent?
Time marches on. Ardor cools.
Well, with the expanding global population -- Let me ask you this -- your wife. Has she pursued the opportunities which must present themselves to the "knock-out, sexy woman" you described?
Not in court you can't. Has she retained counsel?
Wrigley!
Am I mentoring the wrong mentee?
Get me Marylin Rexroth Doyle.
She owes me a meal.
And how would you define your relationship to Mrs. Rexroth. You know -- you are her...?
Divorce was her childhood aspiration?
George was so impressed he hired him when he divorced his second.
We can't do the impossible, Mr. Andrews.
I've put extra men on, all along the way.
I was surprised to get your note. My daughter hadn't told me anything about you. About your helping her.
Please understand me. When I say she didn't tell me anything about it, I mean not until a little while ago. She thinks you're entitled to anything you can get.
don't know. I'd have to see on what you base your claim. I presume you feel you're justified in—
What ten thousand?
All I want is thirty-nine sixty. If you'll give me a check I'll get out of this place. It gives me the jitters.
Here you are.  Do you mind if I ask you something frankly?  Do you love my daughter?
That's an evasion.
A normal human being couldn't live under the same roof with her, without going nuts.  She's my idea of nothing!
I might.
Smart, aren't you! So subtle.
What do you expect to accomplish by all this? I'm already married!
He's one of the best fliers in the country. Right now he's planning a trip to Japan.
A time will come when you'll thank me for this.
Landing on the lawn in an autogyro.
If you have, it isn't too late. You know how I feel about him. But I want to make you happy. You gave me such a scare—I—when I couldn't find you.  You know, the old pump isn't what it used to be.
I haven't seen you cry since you were a baby. This must be serious.  Where'd you meet him?
Fine man to fall in love with.
Well, under the circumstances, don't you think we ought to call this thing off?
On a hunger strike, huh?  When'd she eat last?
What a hell cat. No controlling these modern girls.  They're terrible!
What happened?
Ooooooh.  Hello my would-be ex-son-in-law. I've sent you a check for a hundred thousand. Yes. That's the smartest thing you ever did, Westley, not to contest that annulment. That's satisfactory, isn't it? Yeah. Well, it ought to be. Oh I'm not complaining. It was dirt cheap.  Don't fall out of any windows.
Never mind, son. She doesn't want it. 
Me? Forget it, son.  I got millions.
Hey, hey, aren't you afraid you'll burn out a tonsil?
Oh, I wouldn't kid you . On the level, it actually happened. Nobody bought a paper that day. They followed me all over town and read the news from the seat of my pants.
These seats accommodate two passengers, don't they?
Oh, my heavens! It's gone!
What am I going to do now?
What's the matter? Wouldn't the old meanies wait for you?  Say, how old are you anyway? Don't you know these busses work on a schedule? You need a guardian.
Just a spoiled brat of a rich man. You and Westley'll make an ideal team.
Take my advice—grab the first bus back to Miami. That guy's a phony.
That's right. You didn't.
Darn clever, these Armenians.
Your ego is colossal.
That, I suppose, makes everything—uh—quite all right.
Do you mind putting out the light?
Come on! Hurry up! Breakfast'll be ready in no time.
Where is the shower?
Must be the Spring.
It has its moments. It got to be a sort of game to try to outwit father's detectives. I—I did it once; actually went shopping without a body-guard. It was swell. I felt absolutely immoral. But it didn't last long. They caught up with me in a department store. I was so mad I ran out the back way and jumped into the first car I saw. Guess who was in it?
King—King Westley was in it.
Oh, so now I was drunk!
We could start a two-person stock company. If things get tough—we can play some small town auditoriums. We'll call this one "The Great Deception."[8]
Yes, I noticed he was getting a little fat lately.  Ouch!
Okay with me, if you can stand the starvation diet.
Must be some strange power Westley has over you women.  How do you expect to get there?
Your father didn't know beans about "piggy-back" riding.
I don't think there's a "piggy- back" rider in your whole family. I never knew a rich man yet who was a good "piggy-back" rider.
This looks like the best spot.
I am. I only work when I have to. Two years ago I got a notion and went to China. There was a war going on. Swell! After a while it got stale. I went down to Tahiti. Just lay on the beach for six months. What could be sweeter?
There it is. Better swallow it. We're not going to have any breakfast.
Carrots.
Uh-huh. Want one?
You don't think I'm going around panhandling for you.  Best thing in the world for you—carrots. Had a tough time getting them. If that farmer ever caught me—goodnight!
Oh, they'll stop, all right. It's a matter of knowing how to hail them.
You! Don't make me laugh.
What happened?
That's swell!
Why don't you stay and watch the fun? You'll enjoy it immensely.
ONE—TWO—THREE—FOUR—FIVE
No, it isn't. I'm hungry and—and scared.
I just want to be let alone, that's all. Life's swell if you don't try too hard. Most people want to get a strangle-hold on it. They're not living. They're just feverish.  If they didn't get themselves all balled up with a lot of manufactured values, they'd find what they want. Peace and calm. When you get right down to it, what's all the shootin' for, will you tell me? After all, you can only eat three meals a day, only sleep in one bed—  Right now, that hay feels pretty good to you, doesn't it? Sure it does. 'Cause you were tired—and it's the only thing around.
Is that the Walls of Jericho going up?
Eight o'clock tonight.
But I don't go in for that kinda stuff—much. I like to pick my fillies. Take you, for instance. You're my type. No kiddin' sister. I could go for you in a big way. "Fun-on-the-side Shapeley" they call me, and the accent is on the fun, believe you me. 
Hey, what's this? Wearing Papa's things? Now that's cute. That's what I call real lovey-dovey. Yessir.
Hey—you not up yet? Come on—come on!
The old man's screwy!
What's up?
Any of your passengers want a place to sleep—there's an auto camp up yonder a piece.
Free verse, huh?  What the dickens was free about it? It cost this paper a gob of dough. Well, I'm here to tell you, it's not gonna cost us any more.
A thousand dollars!  Get out of this office before I throw you out bodily.
What!
You're drunk.
I'd put you there myself.
I met her on a bus coming from Miami. Been with her every minute.  I'm in love with her, Joe.
Yeah, where am I?
All I'm asking is enough gas to get me to New York. The bag's worth twenty-five dollars.
What?
If you ask me, I don't believe they're married.
Yeah. They're all upright till they walk out on you.
I told you! I told you, you couldn't trust him! He's gone!
See that. They're gone!
Not a minute!
What's up?
If you wanna get anywhere nowadays, you gotta keep in touch with all the news, is what I always say.
It's a lotta dough. If I was to run across that dame, you know what I'd do?
Gee! That musta been terrible.  I guess he had it coming to him though. But don't you worry about me. I don't talk. I never talk. Take my word for it. Gee, I wouldn't want anything to happen to my kids.
I don't care if he was doing it with giraffes in the zoo, Numa, it's none of our business.  Let's keep this side of it quiet, shall we?
Why you keep dancing on my head for, my man?  We been thicker'n molasses pie since law school.
And Oswald?
Then how the hell did you get in the Warren Commission, Dean?  Except through the phone records in the Dallas jail?
You've got nothin', Bill.  I'm talking as a friend now.  You're riding on the Titanic.  Time to jump off before you get destroyed along with Garrison.
Did he pay you for this?
What the hell's a Communist like Lee Oswald doing working out of Banister's?
Well, it's a terrific yard, Chief, but the man's an obvious alcoholic with a reputation lower than crocodile piss.
I still have to question what the legal basis is that supports this, boss.  Susie's stuff is colorful, but...
All right, all right.  Break it up.
I don't doubt their involvement, Bill, but at a low level.  Could the Mob change the parade route, Bill, or eliminate the protection for the President?  Could the Mob send Oswald to Russia and get him back?  Could the Mob get the FBI, the CIA, and the Dallas Police to make a mess of the investigation?  Could the Mob appoint the Warren Commission to cover it up?  Could the Mob wreck the autopsy?  Could the Mob influence the national media to go to sleep? And since when has the Mob used anything but .38's for hits, up close? The Mob wouldn't have the guts or the power for something of this magnitude.  Assassins need payrolls, orders, times, schedules.  This was a military-style ambush from start to finish... a coup d'etat with Lyndon Johnson waiting in the wings.
If I'm so far from the truth, why is the FBI bugging our offices?  Why are our witnesses being bought off and murdered?  Why are Federal agencies blocking our extraditions and subpoenas when we were never blocked before?
What's it look like, Nick?
Somebody planted that fucking story! And somebody tipped off the press I'm one of Garrison's fucking suspects.  I can't go home. I'm out on the street.  The maggots are everywhere!  Do you know what you've done to me?  It's all over the national news now.  You know what you've done to me?
It leads farther than that.
The Fontainbleau?  20 minutes?
What do you mean?
No... if he did, I don't remember him.  There were lots of kids in and out... y'know.
Yeah, now that's true.  I drove to Houston.
I hadn't been there ice skating in many years, and I had a couple of young friends with me, and we decided we wanted to go ice skating.
No particular reason.  Just to go somewhere.
Why?  What's wrong?
Then who killed the President?
They'll get to you, too - they'll destroy you... They're untouchable, man...  I'm so fucking exhausted I can't see straight.
I can't believe you're saying this in the courtroom.
I'm scared.
He kept trying to get me to change my story about the shots.  He was getting hot under the collar, and telling the woman not to write when he wanted.
We have that taken care of.  You only heard three shots and you are not to talk to anyone about this. No one, you hear?
I'm sorry.
I'm not sure I understand.
Who?
But you didn't seem nearly so sure in your statement to the Warren Commission.
I can't believe a man as intelligent as Earl Warren ever read what's in those volumes.
Jim, what is going on, for heaven's sake!  You going to stay up all night every night?  For what?  So you'll be the only man in America who read the entire 26 volumes of the Warren Report?
No.  I told you I was going to talk to Shaw.
My sympathies.
Did they live?
Just a crank making phone calls. Happens a dozen times a day at the office.
Only cowards make crank calls, sweetheart, nothing is going to happen.
Damn it, if I say I'll spend more time with him, I'll spend more time with him.  I can't fight you and the world too, Liz.
Well so do I, goddammit!  So do I! I had a life too, y'know - I had a life, too.  But you just can't bury your head in the sand like some ostrich, goddammit, Elizabeth!  It's not just about you - and your well- being and your two cars and your kitchen and your TV and "I'm jes fine honey."  While our kids grow up into a shithole of lies!  Well, I'm not "fine" about that, I'm angry. My life is fucked, Liz!  And yours is, too!  And if you don't want to support me I can understand that but don't you go start making threats of taking the children away.
Anything else unusual about him you'd be able to describe in a court of law, Willie?
Goddamn Sam!
General Charles Cabell.  Deputy Director of the CIA.  Fired by Kennedy in '61 because of the Bay of Pigs fiasco, he moved back to the Pentagon, called Kennedy a "traitor".  When he came to New Orleans to address the Foreign Policy Association, you know who introduced him?  Our friend Clay Shaw.
You know, something always bothered me about that from day one, and I can't put my finger on it.
Welcome, District Attorney Garrison. May I call you Jim?
I could give you a false name, but I won't.  Just call me X.
I don't... I can't believe it.  They killed him because he wanted to change things.  In our time - in our country?
The size of this is... beyond me. Testify?
Just speculating, I guess.  How do you think it started?
He's done it before.  Other countries. Lumumba in the Congo, Trujillo, the Dominican Republic, he's working on Castro.  No big deal.  In September, Kennedy announces the Texas trip. At that moment, second Oswalds start popping up all over Dallas where they have the mayor and the cops in their pocket.  Y flies in the assassins, maybe from the special camp we keep outside Athens, Greece - pros, maybe some locals, Cubans, Maria hire, separate teams.  Does it really matter who shot from what rooftop?  Part of the scenery.  The assassins by now are dead or well paid and long gone...
Here's my problem, Jack.  You told me you and Guy were good friends for a long time?
You have other information?
Yeah, he was there, too... sometimes he'd be meeting with Banister with the door shut.  Other times he'd be shooting the bull with Ferrie.  But he was there all right.
Anyone else involved at Banister's level?
HOLD IT, CHIEF...
No, she could get hurt.  If you believe what's happening to these other people.
That's all you've had all this time?
I propose you accept an appointment to the bench in Federal District Court and move into a job worthy of your talent.  Do you have any idea, do you have any conception of how easily such an appointment can be arranged?
Virginia or Elizabeth?
Then do you understand that I cannot tell the truth here?  In Dallas. That there are people here who do not want me to tell the truth... who do not want me to have a retrial?
But if I am eliminated there won't be any way of knowing.  Consequently a whole new form of government is going to take over this country, and I know I won't live to see you another time.  My life is in danger here. Do I sound screwy?
How old is that machine gun shit?
Hey, c'mon in, man. I was just -- you know -- smokin' a fatty, watchin' TV.
Man, I ain't ready to be goin' out nowhere --
I wanna help you, but I don't wanna be locked in the trunk of no car.
And you didn't tell the Police?
She sound scared?
The envelope contains currency... all the same denomination, one-hundred- dollar bills. Now, I'm counting it.
Hi, I'm Detective Mark Dargus. L.A.P.D. can I ask what you have in that bag?
Four thirty. I'm meeting a woman.
Couldn't we just stop at a seven- eleven?
That's why I don't quit. If I can't fly anymore, I'm gonna have a bitch of a time gettin' my brand.
Davidoffs. I get 'em in Mexico. They're hard to find here. I was locked up with the last two getting legal advice from a woman who was in for bustin' her boyfriend's head open with a baseball bat.
They wanted you to tell them what you know.
Whatever it was had to fit in my bag and not hit you in the face if the bag was opened. This ain't solvin' my problem. I gotta figure out a way to either keep my job or get out of trouble. I'm off today, but if I can't leave the country I'm out of a job. And if I don't got a job, I can't hire a lawyer.
Thanks, but I have my own now.
I couldn't wait till I got home last night and wash my hair.
You never got into the whole CD revolution?
This is pretty.
He told me last night.
You're gonna offer to set him up?
Does something else worry you?
I walked right past you.
Catching a movie.
"American President"
Pretty good. Me and Annette Bening are goin steady.
And Annette's it for you?
You talk them into it?
Bring the money in and they follow it?
Make the delivery somewhere in the mall.
Has he hinted around?
No, I mean you, right now. Not it you were somebody else.
A lot of reasons. But the main one would be I'm tired of it.
And is that it?
I'm not sure you answered my question.
Oh, yeah. I got them thinking Ordell's real nervous. They love thinking he's scared of them.
It'll be more than that.
But you still have to show him the money at the airport.
Then you're out and you get nothing.
How does Winston find him if A.T.F. and all the local Police can't?
Only this isn't a bail bond, Max.
We're partners.
I thought you were tired of your business?
Who's side are you on?
Yes'm.
And what would this be, Sweet and Low?
I know what it looks like.
Oh, so now you know him?
How can you help us?
The envelope contains ten thousand dollars. The subject will be delivering the currency in a...
White girl named Melanie Ralston. Another girlfriend of Ordell's.
I'm sure that was the idea.
She didn't say.
We could, if I'm not in jail.
That's fifty thousand, huh? It doesn't look like that much.
You didn't count it?
There was a guy with Melanie?
I have no idea.
Louis Gara's dead. L.A.P.D. found him dead in a car on Ninth. And we've lost Ordell.
We pick up Ordell. We've got three murders we can link him to. We have the storage unit where he keeps his guns, by tomorrow we'll have a search warrant to go in and get him. And we have you.
Oh, hi.
What were you two fighting about?
He said he didn't know about it.
You already knew that?
Jackie?
Are you getting that black suit?
For what?
I understand woman, damn!
Let's get realistic, baby. Sooner or later they're gonna get around to offering me a plea deal, and you know that. That's why you came here to kill me.
The next trip, when I come with all the money, it'll look like I hand it to the same one I did before...
Can you cover that?
That's an agent. Manager's get fifteen percent.
She waits for you to go in the place where you try things on.
He thinks he's Joe Gunn now.
When did you get out of jail?
Is it ready to go?
Which one?
You're fourteen years old here?
Did you ever go I one?
That's a picture of me in Japan.
About five years ago.
I never got to know him, really. I couldn't speak Japanese, and his English was terrible. But I couldn't say anything, because his English was better than my Japanese.
Yeah, that really hit the spot.
He killed a man worked for him the other night.
He went to meet that stewardess.
That's a nice outfit on her. I'm gonna go over and look at this Michi Moon display.
Thanks, Baby.
Who was that?
If this is about you fucked Melanie, I don't give a damn. I ain't a fool. I leave you alone with a bitch like Melanie, you're gonna be fuckin' that twenty minutes after I'm out the door. So say "thank you" and I'll tell you, "you're welcome."
She tryin' to work your ass against me, ain't she?
You didn't even hafta say it. I know the woman.
You keep drivin' down Ninth, to where they got all them car dealerships. We're gonna leave this heap in a parking lot and get one the cops don't know about.  Hey, where's Melanie?
You couldn't just hit her?
Where's the rest of it?
If there were nothin; in here but towels, maybe she didn't get a chance to take it from her suitcase and A.T.F. got it. But, she put these fuckin' books in here to trick our ass.
You know who I saw in the dress department?
How can I help you?
Across the street a Great Western. It goes in a trust account. You'll need to fill out an Application for Appearance Bond, an Indemnity Agreement, a Contingent Promissory Note. That's the one, if Beaumont skips and I go after him, you pay the expenses.
The bond for possession is only a thousand.
It still sounds high.
Why would a stewardess bring me fifty grand?
Man, you know I'm good for it. Thousand bucks ain't shit.
Man, you need to look at this with a little compassion. Jackie ain't no criminal. She ain't used to this kinda treatment. I mean, gangsters don't give a fuck -- but for the average citizen, coupla nights in County fuck with your mind.
Just listen for a second. We got a forty-year-old, gainfully employed black woman, falsely accused --
Well, give it to me then.
All I did was walk out with it.
This place stinks.
She was afraid.
It's the next street.
Who is it?
Ha-ha-ha. I'm serious, you smoke too much of that shit. That shit robs you of your ambition.
Hello.  Hey, Jackie...  No, Jackie, I didn't get your message.
He ain't here right now.
Go on Jake. She reads 'em like a book.
What do you want?
Dr. Singer. It's been a long time.
Do you want some help? I can call upstairs.
By who? Why? Paul didn't have an enemy in the world.
Hello.
What are you talking about?
Daddy, what was that noise?
Doctor.  Ph.D.
I'm too messed up to teach.
What do you mean, demons?
I saw Sarah the other day.
I can't relax.
God almighty. What did you do to me?
What are you talking about? You can barely stand.
Are you in the service?
Jacob, if it was any other brain but yours, I might agree.  Tell me, does your lady friend know what a brilliant thinker, what a sub- lime intellect she's living with?
No.  I see them.
Christ, I know how it sounds.
Demons? I don't know what to tell you. It sounds like a spiritual mat- ter to me. The problem, Jacob, is that you have no context for it. You're a renegade Existentialist suf- fering demons a hundred years after Freud. How the hell am I supposed to make it fit?
What's your name?
I'm not cold.
Jezebel, from the post office. You remember, you met her that time at the Christmas party. I was living with her. God, it was a nightmare. There were all these demons and I was on fire. Only I was burning from ice.
She had these real beefy thighs. Delicious.
I don't have to ask if you can feel that.
You up?
And look what I got.
Is that the one who died?
I don't know. One of these days, I'm gonna see Louis. My back's killing me.
Kids on a joy ride. Happens all the time.
We're at Della's.
Can't you stop it?
What's it say? A hundred and two?
What the hell are you doin'?
You're out of your mind. I'm not getting in there. I'd rather die.
Don't gimme that.
Look, I'm horny. Keep it in mind.  Love me a little?
I know.
I put a frozen dinner in the oven, a Manhandler. It'll be ready at a quarter of. I threw a little salad together. It's in the fridge. I also bought some apple juice, Red Cheek. Don't drink it all. Oh, and Jake, your lawyer called.
While you were in the shower.
He didn't give me a chance.  Look, honey, don't get upset, but he's not taking your case.
It's just me.
Who else were you expecting?
Are you out of your mind?
It's amazing, you know, that a drug could change things like that, destroy a life and then give it back. It's hard to believe that the world could be so hellish on day and like heaven the next.
This is one of my dreams, Jake. Ever since I was a little girl. I never thought it would happen.
I can waitress. I'm good.
What'd you do that for? It's an in- teresting story. All these people are still disappearing. Right off the street.  Hey, what's wrong? Are you all right?
You look terrible. What happened?  Jake ... is it the antidote?
Look at yourself. You look like you've seen a ghost.
I'm not bugging you. Come and lie down. I'll give you a massage.  Where'd you go today?
Where have they gone?
No shit. They had me by the balls. Next thing I know I'm in Saigon ... in a secret lab synthesizing mind- altering drugs. Not the street stuff mind you. They had us isolating special properties. The dark side, you know? They wanted a drug that increased aggressive tendencies.
Anyway, this big offensive was coming up. Everyone knew it; Time Magazine, Huntley-Brinkley. And the brass was scared 'cause they knew we couldn't win. Morale was down. It was gettin' ugly in the States. Hell, you remember.
None of us can remember that night. I get flashes of it but they don't make sense. We saw shrinks for years. But nothing they did could ever touch it. What happened? Was there ever an offensive?
But there was an attack. I can still see them coming. There was a fight, wasn't there?
I always suspected the effects might come back. That's why I had to follow you. I had a hell of a time getting hold of your records.
The truth can kill, my friend. Five hundred men died out there. This isn't a story they'd ever want out. When Paul's car blew up I realized the scope of the thing. I knew they meant business.
You come here often?
I came up with the formula back in Nam but I never got a chance to use it.
I think I'm falling asleep.
I can't move.
And no more demons. I told you they'd be gone.
It was paradise, Michael. You showed it to me. You were there.
Mike, it was real. It was glorious.
Here. I've got every credit card ever printed. Take this. Stay here till you can arrange to get away. It's on me.
What? You want the Plaza? Don't be foolish. Here. Take this, too.  This is my place on Prince Street. It's got my phone, everything. Call if you need me ... but you won't. Everything's gonna work out. You just get outta town as fast as you can. The New York police can be effective when they want to be.
Please come quietly.
You're lucky. How many vets you know are even employed?
The army?
Do you want me to get someone?
I don't blame him. What should I do with the ice?
You got lucky. I could have waited until he ate your head.
Okay, enough of this shit.
It's locked!
What are you doing?!!
Rizzo pull the fucking lever!
Remember, stay calm, use your thrusters. We'll be fine.
Damnit to hell, you left me back there to die!
Bomb?
Can't shut em' down from here.
Uh-oh.
Where the hell were you?!!
Everyone okay?
I'll need system four converters.
We'd need charges.
You're a teacher.
I need to know what you know about this guy.
That's why I'm here.
They were all wrong. They couldn't control him.
His mother was killed before his eyes. That's what drove him insane. It'll work.
Did you like it?
Now what?
Spunky . . .
That's really funny.
God damnit! Will you stop doing that?!
I feel better. Now how do you fire this damn thing?
You're quicker than usual.
Look ice chip, why don't you just chill out and let us handle this?
What do we do?!!
Robot huh?
I'm surrounded by idiots.
No...  That's the sound of the men working on the chain gang.
Almost done.
Sorry, sorry.
You did good, Kay-Em. I'm proud of you.
What?
Damn!  Close the door! I'll be right back.
I gotta go back.
You son of a bitch, you know what time it is?
Trust me. I'm bypassing regular channels. See what kind of payday we're looking at.
I'll reset our course . . . 3 hours?
Azrael can you repeat that?
That's ridiculous. You're overreacting.
You're not going anywhere.
More soldiers?
Guys, please come with me!
How do you open the damn door?
What have you done?
Yes!
Just a favor for your old man.
My cars. And a comic book.
You got it?
The wire's showing!
I never saw one that big.
He's busting the shaft! Start the pump!
He's comin' up -- !
Right.
Did you burn another kettle? Y'know you're a fire hazard? This is the third one!
Be careful.
You're very tight, y'know?  Right there.
It's three feet deep, Martin
Why don't we have one more drink, you and I, and then we go down and cut open that old shark and see for sure what's inside him, or not.
Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum.
Only 24 hours!
Why not, Larry? We could get a positive confirmation that way.
She's right.
He lost it on the way up.
There's only one thing you're good for anymore -- signing a damn voucher. Here. It's an authorization to employ a contractor.
I'm going to hire Quint to kill the fish. I want to see that shark dead.
The best interest in this town would be to see that fish belly-up in the water with a hole in his head. You do the right thing. You authorize me.  Right there. Whatever it costs.
There's a fantail launch out there that won't make it beyond the breakwater.
Officer, I wonder if you could tell me where I could find Chief Brody?
We ought to let it breathe... Whatever.
Yeah. Rogue. Picks out an area where there's food and hangs out there as long as the food supply lasts?
What is all this stuff?
Can you tell from that if a big man- eater is around?
Don't they have lifejackets or something? An extra boat?
I'm familiar with the fact that you are going to ignore this thing until it swims up and bites you on the ass! There are only two ways to solve this thing: you can kill it, or you can cut off its food supply...
This has got to be one big violation...
What's that, a ship?
What day is this?
Think she might've run out on you?
You from around here?
What d'you pay for a place just for the summer?
You wanna call it a night after here?
Better than Cousteau, or Compagno with computers, telemetry, Defense Department funding...
I just wanted to know if you were all right... the Coast Guard let me use their radio. Is Chief Brody there?
Who've you told this to, Lenny?
What's that supposed to prove?
Watch it! Compressed air -- you screw around with one of those and Boom! Careful, huh?
Gettin' ready to run again -- no? No?  What's he playin' here?  Put the gloves on!  Let's see who's gonna tease who now!
I don't know what it is, but it's not a shark.
Coming right to us!
Carcaradon carcharias. A Great White.
Paul? Are you coming downstairs to eat?
You ran eight miles today, Puppy.
Yeah, typically. That's what happens when our moms and teachers get pregnant.
Well! Nothing like experimenting.
So, it looks like you're getting pregnant-er these days.
Really? What are they like?
Hey Junebug, when all this is over we should get the band back together again.
We could get back together too.
We're getting a stretch limo.
You know it's okay.
Mine too.
What a trip, man.
What is your job title, exactly?
Oh, God...
No.
A couple of hours? Why are you going up there in the first place?
It doesn't work that way, kiddo. You don't know squat about the dynamics of marriage.
Ow, ow, fuckity-ow. Bren, when do I get that Spinal Tap thing?
Shit.  Hey, can we give my kid the damn spinal tap already?
What? My eyes are not lying!
Good. Call me when you're OFF the rag.
Whoah. I don't want to see pictures. I don't need to be notified of anything. Can't we just kick it old school? I could just put the baby in a basket and send it your way. You know, like Moses in the reeds.
Well, you don't just invite a random pregnant teenager into your house and leave her unsupervised. I could be a total klepto, for all you know.
Oh. That's, uh, my room. Vanessa lets me have a room for all my old stuff.
Nuh-uh, 1977! Punk Volume 1. You weren't there, so you can't understand the magic.
Like what?
Titanium Power! Get more snatch by the batch!
It's the least I can do. What did you say your favorite band was?
The Wizard of Gore?
Argento's good, but Lewis is completely demented. We're talking buckets of goo. Red corn syrup everywhere. And fake brains up the yin-yang.
This is even better than Suspiria. You've got decent taste in slasher movies, Mark.
So, have you and Vanessa thought of a name for the baby yet?
Nothing. She just hates when I sit around watching movies and 'not contributing.'
I doubt anyone's throwing us a shower.
I imagine you have a collection of punk chestnuts to prove your point.
Wow, I actually feel like less of a fat dork now.
No.
No. No, you definitely cannot do that, Mark. That's a big, fat sack of no!
A baby is not going to fix everything. Besides, I don't know if I'm ready to be a father.
That's not the point. We're just not in love anymore.
Please don't get a divorce! God, Mark, just do me a solid and stay with your wife.
You should try Adderall.
Hi! I'm Vanessa. You must be Juno and Mr. MacGuff. I'm Vanessa.
The tough part's almost over for you. I mean, my girlfriends always tell me the first couple months are the hardest.
Well, shall we start looking over the paperwork? Gerta has already drafted some preliminary documents.
Oh. Sure. Of course you'd want to know how your kid is cooking.
What...
Um, I think people are kind of unsure about the situation because it's not, you know, set in stone.
Right. Well, Juno, your parents must be wondering where you are. You might want to head home.
Hi. I'm here for the big show?
My partner uses these every time we have intercourse. They make his balls smell like pie.
Who is the kid?
What?
Damn skippy, you're not! You don't even remember to give Liberty Bell her breathing meds.
I thought you were the kind of girl who knew when to say when.
Tot ice skating? Tots can't ice skate. Liberty Bell's still getting the hang of stairs.
I'm losing my faith in humanity.
Yeah, like people in love.
What?!
Well, well. If it isn't MacGuff the Crime Dog! Back for another test?
Heavy lifting can only help you at this point.
What are you doing here, dumbass? I thought I was supposed to pick you up at four.
Maybe they'll totally shit and be super mad at you and not let you graduate or go to Cabo San Lucas for spring break.
Well, maybe you could look at one of those adoption ads. I see them all the time in the Penny Saver.
Best to just tell them, man. Rip off the Band-Aid and let it bleed.
Aw, please Junebug?
How do you know I'm so poisonous? Like, what if the adoptive parents turn out to be evil molesters?
Yum. This pretzel tastes like a friggin' donut!
No way! She's pretty.
I wouldn't be so sure about that. He did it with you. He's a man now.
Are you jealous? I thought you said you didn't care what he did.
Okay Juno, I'm really convinced.
Hello. Thank you for having me and my irresponsible child over to your home.
You're doing an amazing and selfless thing for us.
That wall is going to need something. Maybe we could put our first family picture there.
What would be a good time for you?
You lose!
Is it hard to learn?
You dropped this.
...Hey you're good. Thought you said you never played before?
My momma's a beautician. Guess that's where I get it from. She wouldn't hear of my moving in with Early... on account of his just getting out of jail and all. Ain't seen her in nearly a year now. I wish she'd call me, just once.
What?
What's up Adele? Dinner ready?
What if they're dangerous?
Early, what're you doin'?
...thank you.
What's wrong with her?
What's your name, boy?
Where you from Walter?
Never heard of it, any huntin'?
Tight fit.
Can't hurt.
This the book your writing?
This guy killed a mess of people.
Henry Lucas.
...They never caught that Black Dolya Killer, huh?
That your... "theory", ain't that what they call it?
Sure.
...Well I probably drunk more than my share, anyway... you go on an' have it.
...Well then, that's how many I killed.
So tell me... what happened here?
Executing the killer wouldn't bring my mother back.
Tonight turned out to be pretty interesting.
I thought you wanted to be a writer.
So how's it going?
I like that.
We could have been in and out of there in less than ten minutes...
All set?
There's more...
I can't believe I agreed to do this.
I'm sorry, but I just can't see you veggin' out in LA-LA LAND.
...never?
You were plenty hot.
...You know what I mean?
What happened?
Hell if I know, crazy son of a bitch said he was thinking of moving to Texas.
What about the owner of the house...  ...this John Diebold, any idea where he might be?
Well, girl. You tested negative for all sexually transmitted diseases and infections.
What do you think?
She can fuck?
Oh man, it smells like butterscotch.
Oh man, that's the best.
Well, I was flipping through a picture book of her and her family, right.
That would be good. But I mean more like. I don't know. Like when I was having sex with her, I kept thinking how much I would like to put it in her ass. Just to see what would happen.
You thirsty?
You down with the boost?
But that's the thing. Girl's like it slow. They like romance. They like things to be sweet and romantic.
I mean I've been with a lot of girls I know.
Man, this guy is really good.
Darcy. Benny's little sister.
Yeah. She's so little, so pretty, and innocent.
She was handing out those watermelon slices. And I sat down over on the other side, And I watched her.
I don't care motha fucka. I'll bet you money she fucks me.
You wanna run by the park and see what everybody's doing? Get zooted?
Yo. I'm gonna get buff dude.
Nah.
Yo, you think we killed that guy?
You sure?
I don't know. I just never seen girls that did that shit before. But I think it looks nice.
What?
Sup then? Sup?
You should come back with me to Steven's house.
I'm nervous.
You think I want a baby? When you're with me, you don't have to worry about that kinda stuff.
Come dance.
Jennie. You've tested positive for the HIV infection.
I'm sorry.
Sorry.
Are you in trouble with the law?
Like where are your erogenous zones?
Just a lot of crazy shit.
Do you know where he went?
Yep.
And you don't get shit out of it.
Yep. That's the best way. It's that boom boom boom.
You know what it's like. It's like when you really love someone, it's like awww.
Yeah. Mine are my toes. Oh my God if someone sucks my toes I'll come in like ten seconds!
Yep.
Yeah. The shit gets wacked. Fifteen minutes.
Yeah. I've always hated that kid. He used to eat glue in like seventh grade.
Not too late.
Hello?
That's the whole thing. You know if you look at it. I mean all you hear about is disease this and disease that. And everyone's dying. And you better wear a condom or else. But the truth is. I don't know any kids with AIDS. No one I know has ever died from that shit. It's like some weird make-believe story that the whole world believes.
Right.
What man? What is it?
That's crazy!  Why would I draw attention to myself like that?
All you gotta do is look at the map.
Are you crazy?
That's right.  I guess only the killer would know that.
No.
What if he doesn't bite?  What if he's an exceptionally bright Raccoon?
You got it on the board.
The message!  I figured out--
What do you think?
We wouldn't want someone's death to interfere with your games.
What is it?
You should be an actor, Frank.  You looked like you were really mad.  The veins popping out on your neck was a really nice touch.
What do you mean, stand out?
It doesn't make sense because we don't understand it.
We'll find the evidence.
Hello?
Why her?
Just for that no hint today.
Have you any idea what the message is?
What word did you leave last night?
I was thinking about leaving the phone line open so you could hear her die -- but I've decided it's better if you don't know exactly when I kill her. Good-bye Peter.
How'd you know I wouldn't be in the same room with her?
Naw, it's all fixed.  I also loaded up a program that'll analyze your games three hundred percent faster.
Nope.  Nothing.
There's three.  The first is 1983. Lionel Baines.  The Boston...
You're safe.  He wouldn't come here.
So, are you having a good time on the Island?
Okay.  Nice meeting you.
Congratulations, dad.
Whaddaya got, Nolan?
What about prints?
Kathy?
Before we go in I gotta tell you this isn't going to be pretty.
If you can think of anything else give us a call.
This is a printout from the hotel computer for all the messages logged to your room.  Here's one at 9:04 pm.  It says:  From Debi.  Please call me at home.
Why didn't you tell us you were there earlier?
What have you come up with on the riddle?
As large as castles.  You are still light as air, one hundred men can't move me.
He's using the map as a chessboard! The sonofabitch is playing chess with me!!
It's a commercial area.  No one lives there.
Sounds very violent.
You.
Well, I think I've had enough.
What are you looking for?
You sure you don't want to eat something?
It's going to be a long night.  It could take hours before we know something.  You should try to eat.
No.
Can you go fifteen minutes without thinking about it?
Alright.  What about me?
It's alright.  It was a long time ago.
You.
He's replaying the game I played against him move by move, using these girls as the Chess pieces.  All the girls have been found in their homes except Christie Eastman, who was found in back of a warehouse.  Why?
The other night -- I said some things that maybe I shouldn't have.  I mean, you haven't known me very long and I can see how you thought what you did.
That's still no excuse.  You treat everything like a game.
Then help me to understand.  I want to understand.
No, I want you to do good.  That way when I beat you at the end I'll look that much better.
I'm not nervous.
You're really not bad looking. Almost handsome.
We're almost married.
There. Now you look like someone I might want to marry.
Lyssa ... Lyssa ...
Have they harmed you?
Lyssa. Where are they keeping you?
Lyssa ...
Colwyn ...
But it opens onto the sheer wall of the Needle. There's no way down.
I am too old to climb down a rope.
There is nothing.
You must break when the strain becomes too great, or you will harm yourself. And you must concentrate your powers for when they are needed most. What did she answer?
Yes. Each dawn it rises in a different land: sometimes in the mountains, sometimes in the jungle, sometimes the desert, sometimes the sea. Never in the same place twice.
I can't reach her.
I cannot reach her.
Yes.
Can she be forced?
Never.
She must make a glaive.
The spiral begins in the west.
What use is my sword? I can't reach her!
It is my fate to die in the Fortress.
Slayers!
I feel your pain, but I cannot betray her.
I just remembered I have urgent business in this direction.
Your kingship ... your lord high mightiness ... when I called you a ... a ... whatever I called you, I didn't realize that you were ... were ...
And where do you lead, boy?
Forgive me, my friends. I saw terrible things.
Go. I command you.
We must cover a hundred leagues before sunrise.
What is that awful looking place?
Can't I come, too?
If I could wish ...  ... for anything, I'd wish for a venison pie the size of a ...  ... mountain. No, that's too greedy. I'd settle for one the size of a house.
One puppy? Why not wish for a hundred?
Passable, pimple, very passable.
One with red eyes, the other with one eye, both trying to kill me.
He was aiming a huge spear right at me!
He didn't join them. They joined him.
He is the King.
He will not!
Sixty at the needle, another thirty in the forest. Only ten of us made it back.
The new King.
We'll seek an Emerald Seer. They have great powers of vision.
I must go to the widow. Perhaps she will help.
She has the power of vision.
We must reach the Valley of Reeds before the next dawn.
I'll stay behind and keep them busy.
She was not as beautiful.
You had a son.
You had left me! I kept silent out of rage.
You see?
Knowledge.
The Fortress of Krull. When will it come near here?
I cannot stop the sand.
He forgot his money...  My mother's got a pub, behind the corner, and he forgot his money, about 100$.
Good, what are you going to do? Do you come back?
...You moved too, didn't you?
At a certain moment I thought: maybe Leon would like working on his own? So he makes some little extras?
Yeah... Well... I don't know.. I don't know any.
Well, if the guy is far, in a car, and I know weather is going to be bad, rain for example, I think I would plastic the car, with a remote here. I shoot from the distance and if I miss I plastic.
Rocket launcher.
Mathilda? May I come in?
...I'm going to kiss you.
OK, OK! Excuse me! How old were you when you had your first contract?
...I'd like knowing what he's listening to...
Mathilda... There's equally a lot of other things!
May I ask you a personal question?
What do you do, with the money you earn?
I don't know... Five minutes.
How shall we get out now, Leon?
You say it just to calm me!
Huh! You made an error, baby.  I don't know any Danielle.
...Composer.
Because you have to pay.  It's like a parking meter: if you stay, you pay. It's the rule...
Is he still alive?
I think I will get back in Messina this summer... It's too long I haven't been there.
This smells good.
I've all ready gone six hundred miles... I can't do it again.
Then it'll have to wait until I finish.
We're very sorry about that.  Some of our men were on the scene of the accident.
Mine.
Are you a preacher?
A wife?... Did someone piss drunk run into your wife?  Crushed her like a bug.  Snapped her bones?
Oh the preacher's getting angry again...  Tell me something.  Did she die instantly or did she feel every torn muscle and shattered bone? Were you there to help her?  Or were you safe at home when the windshield sliced into her face --
So what's the deal Maurice?
Yes -- you are.
I've seen it before.
You're feeling old and you want to start exercising.  A lot of men your age feel the need to recapture their youth.  Don't feel embarrassed about it.
Why do you polish that thing all the time?
Walk with me?
Ellen, there are two kinds of people in the world --
Your father?
Why there?
Maurice?
Why?
Doubts?  About what?
Why so vague?  Why so evasive?  He could be somebody hot.
A marriage certificate?  Who the hell carries their marriage certificate around?
Your parents would want you to be in bed.
This story is big huh?
The hairs on my arm are standing up... Something strange is happening.
You're amazing... What are you doing Mr. Parker?
You're walking to California?
Ellen told me that she didn't know if I loved her.
Pacifica, California... that's a long ways away.
Are they standing?
In a hospital.
What do your friends call you?
You're in pain.
I don't have kids.
Where did he go?
May I ask you a question that might sound strange?
How are you feeling?
He wants to reward you... That's why I'm here.
If that ain't fate?... Hi, I'm Dave Caldwell.  I do the copy for the anchor on the evening news down here.
I really want that watch.
No alcohol. You gotta get something else. Everything's ten dollars. What do you want?
Non-alcoholic malt beverage?
Orange soda?
Coffee?
Water?
I guess I do too.
Mind if I use the bathroom?
Do you want to fuck now?
If I was I'm sorry.
...or a girlfriend, but if you have some free time... maybe we could have dinner.
I think you know I'm serious. I'll pay you if you like... but I'd like to see you.
Yes.
It wasn't so important to me. I mean, he never asked me why I was a hooker, and that was impressive. I really liked him. So I decided to just play my part. I mean... it's good to help someone once in a while, it's a bonus to being alive, and that was my plan... to stay alive. I suddenly came to a decision.
Let's face it, what the fuck are you doing in Las Vegas?
I don't know.  I'll go and sort it out today. Why don't you come?... We'll find a real room for me. You can pick it out, a tower on the strip.
Sera you are crazy.
Don't you like me, Ben?
Sera... what you don't understand is...
Hi!
Ben?
Why?
What do you mean?
How are you doing?
You were OK for a while, so we walked for about a block and then you said you wanted to go home and fuck, but I think even you knew that wasn't going to happen. We got a cab and you asked him to stop at a liquor store, even though I told you that we had plenty at home. In the store you gave the kid a hundred and told him to keep the change. I asked you if you knew it was a hundred. You said you did, so I let you do it. We got here, you fell asleep on the couch and I covered you up and came to bed.
Here's my speech...  ...I know this shouldn't be acceptable to me, but it is. Don't ask me why. I sense that your trouble is very big... and I'm scared for you... and so I'm doing what I think you need me to do. Falling down in casinos is little stuff. It doesn't bother me. It has nothing to do with us.
Please!
I'll be back home around three. If you're back by then we can watch TV or something... I guess what I'm saying is... that I hope you are back when I get home. Please be careful.
I've missed the best sun. Why did you have to pawn your watch?
I wanted to see you...
What did they look like?
About ready for another drink?
I don't want this. Yuri, please. I really don't want this. You know I don't like to do groups.
You have been lonely?
I'm pleased with you, Sera... how you have moved up in the world. I showed you a glamorous world when I took you off the streets...  and how you repay me.
Go, Sera.  Go. Stay at home. I will call you tomorrow.
Well, then. You'll need excellent recommendations from your professors, a heck of an admissions essay and at least a one-seventy-five on your LSATs.
What're you so happy about? You're on trial for murder.
But is he an ass that's gonna win my case?
I'm a Delta Gamma and I'm a huge fan of yours!
No!
I got out of the shower, walked downstairs, saw her standing over my father, and called the police.
Chutney, why is it that Tracy Marcinko's curls were ruined when she got hosed down?
Come again?
What are you talking about?
I'm sorry, but --
I didn't even get to go to his birthday party.
You ready?
Uh -- family.
I believe her, too. I don't think she's having an affair with Enrique.
Too demure?
Do they just -- put you on the spot like that? Like, all the time?
Donovan, Royalton and Levinson.
And make sure you read the footnotes in Levinson's class. That's where all her exam questions come from.
Okay, if Brooke didn't kill the guy, who did?
Aside from that.
A) He's an old man with a really big penis. B) She never told me I was fat. And C) Victoria Principal sells on that network.
But maybe it's not what you think.
You're kind of being a butt-head right now.
Damn. We can't see her for an hour?
She's not!
The what?
Okay, how would it work?
I can't.
He's gay! Enrique is gay!
Up for a celebration dinner?
Neither.
I did?
I don't know --
Amazing how?
Wait -- my social events schedule is missing.
Of course.
I told you, Elle. I need someone -- serious.
I'm sorry, I just hallucinated.
If you tell him, you'll probably make summer associate. Who cares about Brooke? Think about yourself.
Pink ones.
She's naked.
So, I hear the tart from California shot Heyworth.
Hovering?
Is it a Kappa?
Oh, God. What if Josh doesn't think I'm serious enough?
There he is!
Why so few?
Fool's magic.
Fight's over before it's begun... soon the survivors will be in full retreat.
We come watch... we come watch...
Dumb magic.  Giant smash peewee.
We go out, smash 'em now?
Your love.
I speak of love, and you think only of the lash.
On the contrary!  The puling, pallid creature you were before was truly something disgusting.  Now you are splendid... a fierce goddess... the embodiment of all that is strong and beautiful.
God protect me.
Sweet Princess, you begin to sound most reasonable.
Yes?
It's odd... when I first found myself... changing... I was sick with loathing and disgust.  I thought I was so ugly I wanted to die...
You come stealee tleasoo?
Dlagon not like that.  Dlagon is spilit of life... spilit of stlength and goodness.
Flozen foleva not good.
You come stealee tleasoo?
Baron Couer de Noir is a blight 'gainst all nature.  We dwarves be not fighters; still we are with you in this battle.  Some of our handiwork may be of assistance.
No!  Tis not the time!  I want no part of your frolic.
You have me word, lad.  To answer a faerie riddle deserves as much.
Generally known!  What general ever knew more than to lace up his boots?
Don't you know?
That much magic I can offer ye, a small measure of entertainment at best.  Making the world a frozen hell is beyond me modest powers.
Here now.  Toss her this when you've the chance.  Jenny Greenteeth can't resist the sight of herself in a glass.  She's terribly vain.  Praise her beauty and you'll lull her sweet as a babe in a cradle.
I'll do what I have to do, for Princess Lili's sake!
So I'm to be a dragon-slayer, is that it?
Better pray the worm's a sound sleeper, Jack.
There be no finer victuals than worm flesh, lad.
What is it?
Pregnant, is she?
This is ogre's magic.
I trust our own welcome will be more hospitable.
Certainly understandable.
Wait!
We're blind now.  Oona was our eyes and ears.  How do we find the Castle Couer de Noir without her?
Aye.  We be on a quest to set the world aright --
Give in to despair and all is lost.
Water doesn't burn...
One more turn...
Nay.  You've not reckoned with the powers of faerie medicine.
Because sunlight will kill him. Quickly now, give me the key.
Aye.  Hurry now, Gump, the key!
The kitchen be the most important room in a palace, for if the victuals ain't right, little else is likely to be so.
Not in the mood, I'm afraid.
On a day like none other the blessed earth has ever seen... A day so fair as forty springtimes --
Well done, lad.  Stout heart.
Barely living, from the looks of it.
Look at that shot!  Three at once! I can't miss!
Start acting like you're worthy of this mission... Here.  Whatever you do, don't dare drop it.
Dolt!
But you did... you did!
Liar!
It's my father, gone a-hunting.  The Baron Couer de Noir is his guest and must be provided with some sport.
A promise is a sacred oath.
A gentleman would offer water.
What shall we do?
Such grace... and their smell; it's ambrosia.
Jack!
He'll not flee if I show myself?
I've no fear of failure.  Your implications are most unbecoming.
What happened?
Its powers are strong.
I'm afraid it may storm.
I have no wife.
If wishes were horses even beggars would ride.
I thought you were dead... I --
It's the Baron's damnable work!  Too cowardly to stand and fight... he used you to save himself.
Sunlight?
So, he's hiding in the dark...
Sweet Jack.  I'm so sorry you found me asleep.  Don't know what came over me.
Nay, dearest Jack... you are to be my husband.  I want none other.
What's the matter?
Biting you?
Pinching?  Where?
Honored to make your acquaintance.
I like well your conceit, Jack.  Tis rare to find an honest lad in this troubled world.
Not very precise directions.
Nay.  Tempting as your invitation be.  Tell me one thing more.
Princess Lili, Godwin's daughter. She was with me when calamity struck, but after I could find no trace of her.
I don't believe you.
I'm promised to another!
Oona... don't cry... please, you mustn't...
What care I for the human heart! Such a soft, spiritless thing it is. I prefer the hearts of hawks and wolves; fierce and free and keen as steel!
What do we do now?
I'm in your debt, Screwball.
Where?
What can you steal from a man already lost his life?
What care the bones when the soul is free?
Each fit for a hero... My uncle fashioned a hammer for Thor.  Twas he named it Mjolnir.  Grandfather forged Excalibur... You won't ever see finer craftsmanship.
How came you by this blade?
You're with us in battle.
There'll be spoils aplenty if you guide us there.  Once we breach the walls, help yourself to all you can carry.
Let that be our problem, just get us there.
Plenty treasure inside... Jimmy seen it once.
And we got to take all the old paint off all the doors and then George taught us how to stain everything and he even let me choose the color I liked best!  And he said he loved me!
Did you know him before you knew Dad?
What's that for?
Atonement.
Are you his friend?
What's today?
I had them in my pocket.
You're a good girl.
You have to ask like that?
Did you feel anything?
It's not what I was expecting.
Hey.
You should stay.
Where's your dad?
I can't even take a shower here.
I might not stay, anyway.
Your dad dated my mom after her divorce.
Not really.  No.  Kinda.  He got busted?
Why are you so uptight?
It means I'm gonna shampoo my hair and stay out of your way.
Hey, I can get you three hundred cash for two hours.
He's at work while I'm here.
I have the permit.
I'm good, thanks.
Then it sounds like I'm doing you a favor.
Is Alyssa home?
Sam?
The whole summer, man.  Party in Tahoe.
Who are you, anyway?  I don't even know you.
Your nose ring comes out of your nose. If you've got them in your nipples, they come out, too.  And there's no make-up at my house.  No glue sniffing.  Huffing. No pills, no grass.
Probably in the bible.
What are you doing?!
Do you ever get like the slightest inkling that you might want to help me instead of doing absolutely nothing?
It bugs me.
I don't know.
What would you like to be?
What would you be doing now?
If I asked you to stop, would you?
And you told Mom today?
I never tried to get you to like me.  I tried to get you to love me.
I'd eat a lot of red meat.
I aimed high.
It was in my name so he wouldn't lose it. He stole it from everyone that deserved it by putting me on title.
Ah!  Oh....
Why do you let your dog crap on his lawn, day after day?
Lock the door behind you.
I drove over and you were gone.
You head was pressed against my chest.  I could feel your heart racing.  And I remember I kissed your hair.
Do you need help?
It's been a while.
Let's see if you've gotten any better.
I thought we were helping.
Nothing is going on with us, is it?
Don't move!
Nothing.
Do you think it's odd your kids don't hug you?
If I let everything that should worry me, worry me, I'd be dead from worry.
I'd love to drive through New England in the Fall.
Hey.
Do you know anything about building a house?
I guess I could teach you some things.
What are you doing in my room?
The door was open.
Ryan, would you rather swim or work?
No, nigger.
Maybe you didn't notice, but this is a prison.
Look, I am truly sorry about this. I'd like to help you...
Yeah...
You been on the farm for quite a spell, haven't you?
You know I trust you, Claude.
Cool it, Ray. You're gonna get us in a lot of trouble.
Season tickets to the Yankees. Right there on the first base line.  What's wrong, baby?
Yeah, that side of the family has all the looks and none of the brains. I hope he don't mess things up.
I've never seen you in here before.
Start your job? What kind of job?
That's some long green.
No, tell me what's so funny.
The Negro League don't pay so good. And you're always on the road. That don't wash with Daisy.
At some point a man's got to get serious about his future. I'm sure you have no idea what I'm talking about.
Like this?
I said you're soft.
Alright. You want some pie?
Nice meeting you? You've been here before, haven't you?
Guess we better get going, huh?
What are you talking about?
What ain't there?
Man, this is gonna delay everything. Spanky's gonna be pissed.
I wouldn't do that if I was you.
What a second, you've been in here since you were thirteen?
No, man. I want you to have it.
Cookie drew me a map to Greenville.
What does that mean?
Look, my cousin Maynard is a lawyer. He filed an appeal on my behalf --
Come on, man. Don't shut me out. I'm telling you, you and me, that map, we can go places.
You call this a map? What was Cookie smoking when he drew this?
All right, man, just settle down. We'll get outta here, Claude. We'll get outta here real soon.
Give me back that hot dog. I'll eat it myself.
You can starve to death for all I care. Now shut up, the game's about to start.
Let it go, Claude.
He said they keep it parked out behind the barn. Can't be that hard to fly a plane. Lots of people do it.
Better watch yourself Claude, before you say something you regret.
I hope you don't think I owe you anything. Because I don't owe you a damn thing.
I was sorry to hear about your mama passing.
What?!
Damn, it was getting hot in there.
You didn't think I was gonna let you escape alone, did you?
What'd you say?
Nurse Humphries was checking my prostate this morning. I got an erection.
It's too late for plans.
Next thing, you're gonna be complaining about the seats.
How you doin'?
Then you won't have no problem making the adjustment. You need anything, help of any kind, gimme a holler. Name's Jangle Leg.
At least he didn't kill Santa Claus with his bare hands.
Why ain't his pick swinging?
He's from New York City. That one, too.
All in, boss!
Maybe I oughta eat your corn bread.
That's right, fellas. Catch any cab heading uptown. All the drivers know Ray's Boom-Boom Room.
What do you think about that?
Wait for the firemen!
Lemonade?
Respect? Well, isn't that progressive.
Is there any truth to what he's saying, Pike?
Yeah, it's special. They don't make 'em like this anymore.
Apparently, your sister died.
Hey, Ray, Goldmouth don't believe me. Ain't it so they got trains up in New York City that run under the streets?
Hey, Ray, what's the name of that nightclub of yours?
Blacks welcome there?
You don't have to drown that fella, Spanky. You already scared him half to death. He didn't know who he was fucking with.
Adrian, you gotta come back to Hell. Dad's sick.
Of course I can. Drink or she dies.  Unlike you, she won't come back from where she's going.
Um, excuse me, we're having a private conversation here.
I lowered the drinking age to ten.
Thank you, Nicky. Cause now I'm gonna bust Adrian's head wide open.
Oh, Nicky, I've missed you. Come on out and say hello...
The home of eternal damnation, house of Hades, H.E. double toothpicks...
What is it?
Where is he? He's late.
They castrated him. He can't shoot arrows, he can't piss smoke.
Oh my God, he just opened his mouth and swallowed that spit.
Okay, just point me in the right direction next time.
You can't do jack shit... unless you learn your evil powers.
We had the greatest afternoon of my life until Adrian made me tell her she had a heart-shaped ass.
What's with all the whoo-whoo noises?
Yeah, but Joe was coming here anyways. Just go back to Earth and enjoy your records and the Hall of Fame and the beautiful family and all that.
No, no, that's not what I said. He can keep his thumbs, but the fingers gotta go.
Check one-two. Check one-two.
This was a very difficult decision, because I have three wonderful sons. I mean, Adrian, so smart, so ruthless. And Cassius, so strong, so tough. And Nicky, so... so...
I don't care what kind of mood you're in at the start of that song. When it's over, that mood has been altered. Wow. Great shit. What's next?
To do that Cassius and Adrian have to come back through the other way.
That's a train, son. Don't stand in front of them.
Listen, I got down low. Your mom's got up high. You take care of the middle.
I'm lucky to get away with just the head boobs, right?
You know, I was the one who created Hell.
You know what was in Hell when I came down here, Cassius?
No wonder your uncle's so weird...
Easy, Liberace.
What's with that guy?
Looking for the chief.
This don't look good.
What's Ozzy trying to say there?
No thanks. I'm afraid I wouldn't be able to give Ozzy the focus he deserves.
So I was driving to work today, and some bozo in a Cadillac cut me off...
I'm not Nicky. I'm not home! I don't live here!
You think I'm a tourist?
Want to? A million angry octopus people couldn't hold me back!
For me? Better feel sorry for yourself, Sandman!
How do you think we got here??!!
Never a pair. I have never had a pair.
Answer the question!
There must be somebody else up here. I can't believe that he's --
You should've seen me take my last Runner... perfect.  I backed him up against a residence pool and when he terminated... his hand...  So now you've seen him... what's the difference awake or asleep?
That was a great shot you made.
That's right. The other one came after. The older one. Smashing, killing, burning!
What's wrong, Available?
Please... no?  You mean "not here" -- that's it? You're a private Available but particular.  Don't worry. There's no one here but me. And you.
Sad? What made you sad?
Of course.
About running, dying what?
Where did you get that?
I wish I could help you.
They're like beasts. Wild.
Yes, but they won't know that... or care. They're hunting you, Logan. Maybe me too, now...
Are you taking me to them?
You think Sandmen will?  There's no other way for me,
I'm afraid.
Because you felt like a Runner, didn't you.
It's getting dark and cold. I'm tired.
"Beloved son"...  So people stayed together for that feeling of love... They would live and raise children together and be remembered.  I think I feel that way, Logan. Can we be that way?
Is it inside the city?
Yes, cats, of course. What else could they be? Cats. Of course each one has his own name too.
What belongs to the people?
Hello, Sandman.
We don't get many Sandmen. I think we've only had one other since I've been here.
How long have you been living here?
Are there any other humans?
It isn't fair. I'll give you one of my favorite cats... a Jellicle cat.  "Jellicle cats have cheerful faces, Jellicle cats have bright black eyes; They like to practice their airs and graces And wait for the Jellicle Moon to rise."
We're leaving.
Thousands and thousands... as many as my cats?
You're not contagious are you?
You want somethin'?
Pete... You okay?
I'm, okay... You okay?
Do you always sleep here?... In this room?... Both of you?
I like to remember things my own way.
Why not?
Do you own a video camera?
No.
We'll see that the patrol of the house is doubled.
Like you'd get if it was hand held.
You recognize that guy?
He'll kill us.
Lemme call him now. Make sure he's not already busy tomorrow night.
You killed him.
Look at all this shit... I know a fence... he'll give us money and get us passports in exchange for this and the car...  We can go anywhere.
Dick Laurent?
Wonderful!!... Wonderful to see you, Pete. How are you?
What night is that?
Goin' out with these clowns for a while.
What's up?
You don't look so good.
Please tell me.
Where's Pete?
Where is he now?
Did you ask him who he is?
One of the guards must have leaked it.
You just gonna let him go?
Now, Mack, what's the situation?
I wouldn't know how.
When he went to work, right.
I want to see him.
No... I don't feel so good. I would like some aspirin.
Who is it?
I'll get a manual.  and study it.
It's nice to know I can still make you laugh.
What's that?
Who's it from?
Good book, huh?
Same one you were reading the other night?
I called, you know.
I had a dream about you last night...
Don't you want to watch it?
We will.
I'll make sure the alarm is set from now on.
Let's go home.
I mean it, Pete... Like THAT!! 
At sixty?
Thanks, Mr. Eddy.
Mr. Eddy?
I missed you.
You want some company?
You still care about me?
Sheila?!
Sheila...
Hey... Sheila.
Not even a radio?
What about those men we met this morning?
Two years!?
Fossils, huh?
Sorry.
Yeah, I remember. You said that before.
I see.
Wait a minute. Is it a good morning? Say, we're supposed to be traveling east, aren't we?
I always get it twisted because I'm left-handed.
Yes. And who is he ? How'd he get there?
Left us here to rot. That's what they've done. Heroes of the newspapers!
And say, honey, you look a million per cent better. Wholesome, kind of - and clean. You take a tip from me, and don't you ever put that stuff on your face again. Why, it's like hiding behind a mask.
Yes.
You were asked to have a glass of wine. Sit down!
Oh my, isn't that pretty! What is it?
Hey, what's happened to you?
All right! If you insist on being an idiot, I'm not going to waste time coaxing you.  How about you?
Where is your mad pilot?
Goodness, no!
Oh, yes.
You know, that's the fourth time you've said that today. You should have a record made of it.
Who?
Your brother seems quite fascinated by her.
Please calm yourself. You'll soon be well if you do.
What exactly do you mean by "almost any time now"?
Amazing, Mr. Chang. This place is amazing! And that marble quarry in the valley is simply magnificent. Oh, I've looked around. I've seen everything. Your woodworkers and your cloth-weavers - they all seem so very, very happy.
Oh, yes. There is a tribe of porters some five hundred miles from here. That is our only contact with the outside world. Every now and again, depending upon favorable weather of course, they make the journey.
The High Lama is the only one from whom any information can come.
The High Lama? Who pays any attention to him? The porters laugh at the High Lama. All they want to know is how much gold he will give them. Well, I gave them more gold. I've been stealing it for a year. I'd do anything to get out of this place. To get away from that High Lama - the one who calls himself Father Perrault! Why, he's been insane for years!
He's dead? That's fine. You won't see me shedding any tears over him!  Oh George, you must take me with you!
I trust you have been comfortable at Shangri-La, since your arrival.
We need men like you here, to be sure that our community will continue to thrive. In return for which, Shangri-La has much to give you. You are still, by the world's standards, a youngish man. Yet in the normal course of existence, you can expect twenty or thirty years of gradually diminishing activity. Here, however, in Shangri- La, by our standards your life has just begun, and may go on and on.
Yes, of course, your brother is a problem. It was to be expected.
The next time you're in wild country like this, keep in touch with the British Consul.
Did you say we saved ninety white people?
Oh, stop it!
Something happened to me, when we arrived here, George, that - well - did you ever go to a totally strange place, and feel certain that you've been there before?
I don't know.
Well - I mean—
Uh-huh.
Porters?
For heaven's sake, Bob, what's the matter with you? You went out there for the purpose of—
George - you're behaving like a child. You haven't opened your mouth in two weeks.
I said we're getting out of here. Back to civilization. I made a deal with the porters. They brought in a load of books or something, and they're leaving tomorrow at dawn. They're waiting for us five miles outside the valley. Come on, get your things together. Where's your top coat?
You've got to talk about it. What about me? You said they stole that plane to bring you here. I didn't want to come. You owe me some responsibility.
Look here, Bob, Ever since I can remember, you've looked after me. Now I think you're the one that needs looking after. I'm your brother, Bob. If there's something wrong with you, let me help you.
I'd go mad!
Maria?
Where did you come from?
No. That's not possible! If we had landed, we all would have been awakened.
We'll smash his face in. That's what we'll do.
At the mercy of a mad pilot.
A man whose life was empty!
I really only brought you here to show you my pigeons!
What is?
I'm sorry. I thought I was to be the light. But why do I confuse you? Am I so strange?
I'm sure of it. Just as I'm sure there's a wish for Shangri-La in everyone's heart. I have never seen the outside world. But I understand there are millions and millions of people who are supposed to be mean and greedy. Yet I just know that secretly they are all hoping to find a garden spot where there is peace and security, where there's beauty and comfort, where they wouldn't have to be mean and greedy. Oh, I just wish the whole world might come to this valley.
Beautiful! I'm waiting for the bump.
I've thought about it for years.  I knew you'd come. And I knew if you did - you'd never leave.  Am I forgiven for sending for you?
What do you want him to do?
Why, he's speaking English.
That's what I mean - mysterious. Mr. Conway, I don't like that man. He's too vague.
How about you? Do you want to go?
I don't care what you've got started. Do you want to go?
You promised to come for tea yesterday. I waited for so long.
Thank you.
So... this door.  It's... not an exit...  ?
... think that maybe my supervisors referred me here because of certain issues which I assure you I have spent a good deal of time working very hard to correct--
Well... you know, when you say "normal," what, exactly...
From now on, you'll respond only to the name "Jay." You'll dress in appropriate attire specially sanctioned by the INS Special Services. You're not to stand out in any way.  Understand?
Cowan.  Do you ever think that maybe, just maybe, other people might be right and you might be wrong?
Which do you have your money on, Dee?
Helluva night, isn't it?
This is a neurelyser. it was a gift from some friends from out of town. I need you to look at it.  This red eye here isolates and measures the nature of the electronic impulses currently in your brain.  More specifically, the ones -for memory, which it will then block.   I said I need you to look right here.
Underground gas vein.  Next time, be more careful when you shoot off your guns.
I'm just saying it was cold.  I think she kind of liked me.
Hey, I was workin' her.  I was workin' my thing.
Kay, um... how, uh, fast does this thing actually go ... ?
Jeebs is eager to have me deport him. But would rather kill himself than go downtown. Why?
Looks like a train ticket.
Jesus...
Since how long?
It's marble.
Would you call this a code 100?
Yeah.  His dream and our worst nightmare.
Once-- just once-- I thought I'd made the discovery of a lifetime...
Why don't you ask the Mosebacke?     Brazil. Until 44 years ago they ate with their hands, lived in huts, and didn't even know the rest of the world existed. 44 years ago a well intentioned missionary gave them a fork.  Today, they don't exist.
Hmnn... wall, it's funny, cause usually I'm not all that attracted to stupid guys, but--
We need to talk to you about the alien.
Which way?
How's Dee?
He's gone, too.
Even that little bug you found in Sudbury seems to have taken off.
Hard to tell.  I hope not.
I'm getting a trajectory...
And they're buying it?
As far as I can tell, the guy's what he says he is - alone, and unarmed.  All he wants is five minutes to introduce himself to the public.
How'd you know?
Why, you might ask?  Because you're ready.  Because you've finally gone as far as you can go without it.
A good question.  And a simple answer.  No more hunger.  No more smog. No more overpopulation.  No more war.
Wally!
What?
I can't.  I have to know.
I always wondered what the world would be like.  But now that I've seen it, I don't need to see any more.  It's all right.  Once I'm in the tank, I won't remember any of this.
The drowning woman.  Anne... But it was too late.  Her little girl was already gone.
I'm so sorry... I just want him back... I want him back so bad...
John?  What is it?
That's not much.
So uh, if you were a plastic surgeon before...
There's food in the refrigerator. Make sure you drink a lot of water.
That's right.  It's a combined data stream based on all three previsions.
Looks like she was a neuroin addict like John Doe here, but I show an address history that includes the Beaton Clinic.
Which makes this the worst possible time to show that we're only human.
You understand that a week from now people are going to vote on whether or not what we've been doing down here has been some noble-minded enterprise or a chance to change the way this country fights crime.
I need you to do two things for me. One, watch Danny Witwer.
Danny Witwer is scheduled for a tour of Containment tomorrow --
Lara called me.
You understand, John, that the minute Precrime goes national, they're going to take it away from us.
I'm out of breath!  I'm a fucking fugitive!
Don't run, Chief.  You know we'll catch you.  You trained us.
Look at the kid.  In this one, he's on the left of the man in the suit.
Red Ball?
I show time of occurrence, Friday at fifteen-zero-six hours.
Confirm with trig and image.
As I recall, they outlawed compression firearms in the District ten years ago.
The fact that you prevented it from happening doesn't change the fact that it was going to happen.
The Precogs don't see what you intend to do, only what you will do.
To them.
But you call this room the "temple".
Sorry.  Old habit.  I spent three years at Fuller Seminary before I became a cop.  My father was a minister.  Lutheran.
Flaws.
Wally, listen to me...
Are these all of her previsions?
Detective.  Nice of you to come down here.  Seeing as every cop in the world is looking for you right now.  Jesus, what's up with your eye?
Are you reading my mind right now?
C'mon, Rufus, you've been busted twice for felony hacking.
Four.  Wow.  What a big boy.  I love you, Sean.
Sean --
It floated back up.  I had to take him out and --
But you have to.  They said you would.
You're supposed to kill me.  He said you would.
Yes, I'm afraid that would be from the Doll's Eye.
You don't seem all that proud.
Heal who?
What safe place is that?
John?
This is all my fault.
It's insanity around here.
Lamar, do you know the reason why John came here to work with you?
All right.  Tell you what I'll do. First thing Monday, I'll look over the Witwer evidence and I'll have Gideon run the Containment files, see if anyone drowned a woman named -- what did you say her name was?
Lamar, I found something.
He told me about this.  You got this from Containment?
Now the second image.  Watch the water.  The wind's changed.  The ripples are going the other way.
According to the Sentry, Anderton was watching this at Containment right before he was tagged.
I did find it.  It was inside of Agatha all this time.  So the question is, why would someone want this erased from the data file?
I'm thinking someone got away with murder.
Precog Deja Vu...
What?
Crime of passion.  No premeditation.  They show up late. Most of our scrambles are flash events like this one.  We rarely see anything with premeditation anymore.
Because of the nature of murder.  "There's nothing more destructive to the metaphysical fabric that binds us than the untimely murder of one human being by another".
The man across the street.  I've seen him before...
Cream and sugar.
Just sugar then.  You and John ever come here?
What do you think?  So he can kill whoever he wants to without anyone knowing about it.
Hey. I don't know, I don't want to know. Far as I'm concerned, you're a good kid. I got news, though, without you here I can't keep on your friend. I got enough people pretending to sweep.
Hi, uh, excuse me. I'm here to see Mr. Reuben.
He'll be a minute, hon. You want some coffee?
Yeah, snifters are for cognac --
Thank you very much, sir.
It's as good a suite as we have, unless you want two bedrooms.
Women?
I don't know, Forum's pretty hot tonight. It might be hard to get in, though.
Is he cute?
I know.
What the fuck was that about?
You think he don't know? I give him his cut of seventeen hundred, I think he knows I can't make that lap dancing.
No.
You're not my daddy.
I don't know.
No.
Oh, please.
You talk to Max today?
No coke tonight.  Right?
Max offered to stake me.
I never promised you anything.
Take her.
But what about them?
Your dance is over.
What's up. You all ready to meet Ruiz?
He making the drop?
What's his name?
He must have that shit troughed.
You're not driving Jess no more. Two strikes, Bobby, and this last one was big. The bachelor's father goes to my schul.
Bobby. You're a bull terrier and I got you herding sheep.
Don't I put food on you're table? I sponsor your training, I take care of your girl and her little baby. I even pay that deadbeat friend of yours to push a goddamn broom.
Now you wanna shut up and listen and hear what I got to say?
I got a way we make everybody happy.
Yes, for expenses and such. Now, you'll be contacted on your pager as to where you should go. You each have been given an extra battery, so there is absolutely no excuse as to why a page would not be immediately returned. Am I making myself abundantly clear?
Nah.
Harlem? What is it, a restaurant?
Spa?
This Ruiz guy, what's his deal?
Sorry, man, but...
Did Max mention anything about any jobs?
I wouldn't keep bugging you, but you said he said he would have a job for us.
So I'm like, 'Maybe I'm not on the list cause I'm not a fuckin Persian.'
I do. It's a fuckin Persian Palace.
I think we might.
Shit. Who we kidding? I know I suck, and I held you up for ten rounds --
Please. I got three inches on you. You wouldn't have landed a punch if I didn't let you.
I still can't believe you missed the fucking team bus.
No, man. It wrinkles my shit. Let's grab a fuckin beer --
Jesus Christ, fine. Alright?
Oh, give me a break. Look at her. She don't even know where the hell she is. She'd have more fun at Bordner's.
I don't know.
Holy shit. Can you believe this?
Unless we're supposed to whack out the fuckin' pilot, I don't think we're gonna have to work in the next five hours.
Who you calling?
How much was it?
Great. On my fucking room.
Who's gonna smell me a mile away?
What exactly did they say?
This is bullshit, man.
No. Tell me. What's so fucking horrible about this gig? You've been crawling up my ass for six months to get your name on Maxie's list, and here we are.
Yeah, but you know Horrace. What did you get off him?
You happy?
Yeah, me too. You're a fucking bull in a china shop.
What the hell did you do?
He said it's being arranged. He said Jimmy will know.
Put that shit out...
I swear to God, I'll fucking puke.
The penguin house.
Wanna bet?
Float me a hundred bucks.
You coulda picked up a tab every once in a while.
You did?
It's gonna be fine.
Scenario B. I think I'm getting under Ruiz's skin. I'm no dummy. He doesn't like how it went down with the Red Drag -- Welshman, whatever. Now I got Fruitpie the Magician telling me I can't call my man Max? And that Welshman's sketchy.  Whatever, I don't know where it's coming, which way it's coming from, I'm telling you one thing right now, I'm not gonna be late for the dance.
Look. They're together. You telling me this ain't a set-up?
I don't wear a white wig, I don't carry a gavel.
Yeah. Ricky Slade.
Yes?
I operate out of the Chicago O'Hare hub. Can I help you with anything else?
Stop.
The Welsh dude, sees all these niggers in perms and diamonds and shit, he gets nervous. But you motherfuckers, he just laughs. All beat up in your babaloo suit like Fruitpie the Magician.
Ow, shit...
No shit?
Brilliantly. Care for a pint?
Ricky.
So whenever we want...
I don't know. I thought you might. Any idea what the job is?
A lot of Persians?
What the fuck you think, I wanna 'hang' with you motherfuckers? Yeah you're working. And put down the champagne.
What the fuck was you told? Don't talk, right?
No...
The Red Dragon.
Yeah.
And here I thought you flew in some out of town muscle. How's it going, men?
Well, that's news to me. The name's Tom.
Dip?
I'm working trains. Selling.
Not this boy... I ain't fighting their war. I got my own. Right chere. Heard tell you're a good man to know.
You ain't bullshitting me, is you, boy?
Is your papa West Indian?
Why?
How's it feel?
I told you less paper, less trouble.
1, 2, 8 hit, didn't it?
Shit, what else she gonna say?
Oh, sit down, man. What you tasting? I'm buying.
I'll give you back the 600.
Let Billie finish.
If you ain't trying to punk me, what's your hype?
Talk, daddy, I'm listening. Hey that ain't bad. You got some more?
You ain't lying.
Putting all that poison in your hair.
Leggo. I got to wash it out.
Sure, burn yourself, pain yourself, put all that poison into your hair, into your body -- trying to be white.
I respect myself. A man cuss because he hasn't got the words to say what's on his mind.
Man, I'm studying in the man's book. I don't dig half the words.
Where am I gonna start?
Sure, white man throw us a bone and that's supposed to make us forget 400 years.
Little.
I'm not Malcolm Little and I'm not Satan.
I can't.
I don't know how.
Brother Bembry, can we fix it so our loudspeaker is heard on the street?
I'll have it tomorrow.
Folks are sitting out there today, not next week, expecting to hear our program.
Women talk too much. To tell a woman not to talk is like telling Jesse James not to carry a gun or a hen not to cackle. And Samson, the strongest man that ever lived, was destroyed by the woman who slept in his arms.
Sat down with a pretty girl and had an ice cream soda.
Talk about what?
Do you know what Bembry is doing? You're so blind, everyone can see this but you!!!
Get some sleep.
Let's cancel.
Just what are you saying?
Mr. X is a demagogue. He has no place to go, so he exaggerates. He's a disservice to every good law-abiding Negro in the country. Can I ask you a question?
Can I ask you something?
Fourteen counts of 8 to 10 years.
Baby, I'll call you tomorrow.
Make it 1000. We got a lot of fishing to do.
Sheeet, you ain't. I had aplenty.
You like 'em scrambled soft or hard, sweetie?
Sweetie, they're almost ready.
You evil this morning.
You will, baby -- if the time come.
Well, all right, then.
That's a fine chick.
Bang, bang. You're dead.
I forgot to tell you I'm wearing a bulletproof vest.
I'm tired of always playing the cops. I wanna be Bogart sometimes.
That ain't bad.
What did you do, Homey, palm it?
I got to hand it to you, Homey. That's the best preacher hype I ever did hear.
You is something, Homeboy. My trouble is -- I ain't had enough stuff yet, I ain't et all the ribs I want and I sure ain't had enough white tail yet.
I'm half wop, half nigger and ain't afraid of no one.
Then I put him to bed and pour talcum powder on him like a baby. He gets his jollies off.
So? The man got silver, china, rugs --
Only a pig could do a thing like that.
What am I doing here?
You walk out and deal justice. You're what I wish I could be.  The policemen who kills you, his family will have all they want.
Creasy...  I'd have liked to have known you under different circumstances.
[Senor?]
Where do I find you?
What do you know about the cop? Tazinari. The one who made the ransom drop with Samuel Ramos?
Another favor... get me banking info on Jordan Kalfus. U.S. deposits or withdrawals. Thanks. Oh, get me the same on Samuel Ramos.
I traced the PIN. I have an address for you. But I need to see you.
[Don't lie to me.]
[What money?]
[Do you ever see the hand of God in what you do?]
[The Ramos kidnapping. How did it work?]
[I don't know! We work in parts. A voice calls in a kidnapping. We deliver the target to the guardians. We don't even know them. They might transfer to other guardians. The negotiators and the bosses don't even see the target. They just make the deal!]
[I see him sometimes at the handball court in Chapultepec on a Saturday afternoon.]
[Hello Daniel. I've got your family and I want to negotiate.]
[Please, don't...]
[That he used policemen. That you killed them, it made it a police matter. The Ramos family couldn't refuse our involvement.]
[Who gave the bags to Ramos?]
[That's all I know! Please. I'm sorry for the girl. But it was business! I'm a professional.]
Were you provided with a gun?
What is it?
And what if amateurs try it?
But don't you stay in El Paso?
You been working?
It's not exactly a scam, Crease. Even at half speed you're pretty damn good.
Frank doesn't take to most people. Do you speak German?
Where are you from, Creasy?
No.
Potential? I don't understand.
Pinta, do you have a pencil?
What are you doing?
Do you think he'll come back?
They'll be back in a week.
Do you always sleep with him?
Did you sleep alright?
Doesn't matter. I always finish second.
Why do you ask?
Well, it's a sort of wife.
So how come you know so much about those countries?
What did you do in Asia? Is that where you met the man with cigarettes?
You don't flinch when a gun goes off; you react. You go. Don't listen for the sound; don't anticipate it. Concentrate on the sound itself.
Where you're from isn't so much about geography; it's about events. Where you're from is what happened to you.
I'm tough, Creasy. I'm tough as you.
My mom drinks, too... Why do people drink, Creasy?
That's strange. Frank was a no-show. Not like him to miss a ride.
Continue to play in the wrong key, like you're dyslexic.
The world of our children. How dare they?
How are you getting along with Pinta?
You should know they're tenacious when they want something. And Pinta wants to be friends.
Creasy... Wait.
The family paid the ransom and he was returned two days later.  His father still hasn't gotten up the nerve to ask him if they fucked him up the ass.
And Lisa will be able to save face. We won't be the only family without a bodyguard.
Good news. You're going back to school.
Yes, mom?
I think he's been sick. He's alright now, but I think he's been very, very sick.
I'll call you from Detroit, baby.
My wife, Mr. Creasy.
He has to go, Samuel.
[A bodyguard was shot trying to protect a 9 year old. The bodyguard's American. Not only that he's black.]
He was doing his job, protecting the girl. If police were involved, you figure it out. I'm here for him.
None of your business. Or mine for that matter. I got nothing more to say.
I told you she wasn't especially attractive, but that she had a good deal of charm, and she's really a real nice girl...
I'll call her up.
My old lady, every word outta her mouth, when you gonna get married?
There's a nice-looking little short one for you right now.
We gotta whole pot inna kitchen. We give you a plate-a your own.
Marty, let's go downna Seventy-Second Street area tonight.
I didn't think she was so bad-looking.
Hello, Lou, Angie come in yet?
Hey! What are you doing here?
I gotta pains in my shoulder too. I have a pain in my hip, and my right arm aches so much I can't sleep. It's a curse to be old. How you feel?
We gotta postcard from my son Nickie and his bride. They're inna big hotel in Florida on their honeymoon. Everything is very nice.
Oh.
Who?
I wake up this morning, I hear the baby crying. So I wake up. I come in their room. That girl is shaking her hand atta baby. I said, "You brute! Don't you strike that baby! That's my son's baby!"
When was this?
What they say?
Catherine, you are very dear to me. We have cried many times together. When my husband died, I would have gone insane if it were not for you. I ask you to come to my house, because I can make you happy. Please come to my house.
Hey, I come home from your house last night, Marty was here with a girl.
Marty.
Well, what Marty you think is gonna be here in this house with a girl?
Well, I wouldn't call it an elegant profession. It's in a lower social scale. People look down on butchers.
Well, the point is Mr. Gazzara wantsa sell his shop now, because he and his wife are lonely, and they wanna move out to California in Los Angeles and live near their married daughter. Because she's always writing them to come out there. So it's a nice little shop. I handle his books for him, so I know he has a thirty-five percent markup which is not unreasonable, and he takes home net maybe a hundred, hundred and fifty bucks a week. The point is, of course, you gotta worry about the supermarkets. There's two inna neighborhood now, and there's an A&P coming in, at least that's the rumor. Of course, mosta his trade is strictly Italian, but the younger Italian girls, they get married, and they don't stick to the old Italian dishes so much. I mean, you gotta take that into account too.
I only got about three bucks on me now, but I just live about eight blocks from here on the other side of Webster Avenue. Why don't we walk back to my house? I'll run in, pick up some dough, and let's step out somewhere.
It's only a quarter of twelve. The clock's right over there.
I think you're kidding yourself, Clara. I used to think about moving out, you know? And that's what I used to say. "My mother needs me." But when you really get down to it, that ain't it at all. Actually, you need your father. You know what I mean? You're living at home, and you got your father and mother there, and you can go on like that -- being a little girl all your life.
So I was telling you, my kid brother Nickie got married last Sunday. That was a very nice affair. And they had this statue of some woman, and they had whiskey spouting outta her mouth. I never saw anything so grand in my life.  And watta meal. I'm a butcher, so I know a good hunka steak when I see one. That was choice filet, right off the toppa the chuck. A buck eighty a pound. Of course, if you wanna cheaper cut, get rib steak. That gotta lotta waste on it, but it comes to about a buck and a quarter a pound, if it's trimmed. Listen, Clara, make yourself comfortable. You're all tense.
You want me to take you home, I'll take you home.
Okay, so I'll see you tomorrow night then.
No, thank you, really, Mrs. Pilletti.
Well, maybe that's what they teach you in New York University. In real life, it don't work out that way. You wait till you are a mother.
Are you kidding?
Herbie! Wadda you doing here?!
Oh, that's nice. So the doctor was wrong, wasn't he?
Tommy, before you go, I wonder if you gimme a little advice.
Boy, beautiful day, hey, Thomas?
Tommy, gimme a coupla minutes, because I promised Mr. Gazzara I'd let him know tomorrow. See, what I wanna know, Tom, if a buncha individual retail merchants get together, how does it operate? On individual mark- ups? You know what I mean? Say I'm the butcher and Aldo Capelli, he's the dairyman and grocer, so suppose I mark up thirty-five percent, but he works on forty, so...
Sure. This girl said...
Ha! Who told you about the Stardust Ballroom?
Blue suit, gray suit, I'm still a fat man. A fat ugly man.
How'd you come home, Ma? Thomas give you a ride?
Oh, she's coming, eh, Ma?
Did you offer the young lady some fruit?
I said, is she Italian girl?
I don't like her.
I look over at this one nexta me, not bad, about thirty-five -- Hiya, Marty...
So, Marty, lemme tell you about these nurses, Marty...
So, Marty, let me tell you about these nurses...
I'm with a girl, Ralph.
My son Frank, he was married when he was nineteen years old. Watsa matter with you?
All right, Ginnie, don't get so excited.
Oh, he'll get married, don't worry, Aunt Theresa.
I just wanna thank you people again, because the situation was just becoming impossible.
Sure.
On accounta...
Well, I'll tell you, Aunt Theresa...
There's sort of a built-in prayer for the sick man to get well, but of course that's not the basic intention.
How they goin', Losing Preacher? What do you hear from the Pope?
What do I do with it Hawk? This is a little out of my line.
Good. You've both been working close to the front.
Don't you use olives?
She had this shiny black hair piled up on her head, but later on she let it hang loose and I'll be damned if it didn't come all the way down to her ass.
Okay, I'm a witness, but how do you prove who's right?
Well, he's taken care of. Scratch one hot dog.
Because is not democrash? All peoples created equal?
I don't think I should have opened my big mouth. Sorry, Ho-Jon.
I don't believe it's right for you to involve a boy who's not seventeen years old yet...
So long, Ho-Jon.
Christ Almighty, I think he means it!
Yeah, that's right.  You better get us a chest-cutter before there's trouble.
And you've had a natural four times in a row in a crap game. Right? Does that mean...?
I guess that's why you go for Hot Lips Houlihan.
How can you say a thing like that about an officer in the United States Army?
Don't try to get it far down. Kick it up high so we can get there and surround that son-ofa-bitch.
Any time. Whenever we want.
Let's hear from you, you goddam Yankee. Be nice to see you some time.
There's no point appealing to Colonel Blake. They've got him bewitched.
Give us this day our daily...
If we had closer relations, there wouldn't be any misunderstandings. That's where a football game would help. Between your outfit and mine.
You betcher ass, Dad.
I'm going to play poker until three a.m. or until the patient is ready for surgery. However, if you'd like to operate on him yourself right now, be my guest. I get the same dough whether I work or not.
Now, General, I'm going to sandbag you. Do you think we're ready to get out of this belly?
Well, Dad, we haven't found any holes in the large bowel. They've all been in the small bowel, but the smell is different. I caught a whiff of large bowel, but it ain't staring us in the face, right?
Must be fun. But the point we want to make about Henry...
A-negative. I've cross-matched it.
Radar!
I think I've seen this nut somewhere.  Haven't I?
I came within about ten yards of you. You know something, Trapper, the way we been going, if we ever got to see a real golf course again, I bet we could burn it up.
Is he out?
Best thing you could do for all of us is grab some sack time.
Christ, it's Ho-Jon!
If we squeeze him through, I'm going to get him into Androscoggin College.
Dartmouth's too big and too expensive. If he's as good as I think he is, he can move into the big league later. But Androscoggin first.
It was in the cava and the hole sealed itself off. I must have jiggled it just enough to turn it loose. I can't feel it in the heart or the right pulmonary artery. So it's in the left pulmonary artery.
We'll have to close this hole and make one on the other side.
It's five minutes into nurses' shower hour. Where are they?
That kind of familiarity is inconsistent with maximum efficiency in a military organization.
Listen, we look pretty lousy out there, right?
What's the matter?
Isn't this ridiculous, Doctor? Six months I've been here and there are still times when I can't stand it. I just go to pieces.
But I'm married.
I couldn't have slept tonight anyhow.
Dear, sweet Hawkeye.
How would he avoid it... as if I needed to ask?
Do you think anything between us could be impersonal? Or pure? You better forget logic, because you're proving why I shouldn't go to bed with you.
You're asking for somebody else?
It's your decision, Maria. I don't want to high-pressure you.
Two-man job. How much blood has he had?
You really say the cutest things.
Painless, you mustn't talk that way. It's a lot of crap. Cover for what?
Morning Painless. How they goin'?
Good morning, Captain Pierce and Captain Forrest.
Pain bad, Ho-Jon?
The blonde dish.
You work those kind of hours, you got to have rest. Which you can't get with somebody jabbering away on a direct line to heaven.
It's a nice idea. I mean it has style.
Yes, that's what I mean.
If you say so, Henry. But remember my claustrophobia.
We got it, men... Ho-Jon's keep as Androscoggin... if there is such a place. And the big news is, the General wants a rematch.
O'Reilly!
Can you make out what they're talking about?
Chopper coming in, Colonel. Two of them, I'm afraid.
If I can make a suggestion, Coach.
Those two big guys were tackles on the Cleveland Browns, and the redhead played halfback with the Rams.
Morning, girls. Good morning Major.
Planes mostly. May take a crack at rickshaws. How does the direct approach work over here?
Soup? Rice? What are we doing, beginning all over again?
You're a couple o' sticks shy in your column, Ann.
Did you get it, too?
Never mind those guys. All right, stand up. Now let's see what you look like when you protest.
Hello, John.
Do you care if I sit down out here?
But here's the funniest part of it all. I was the fella up there doing the marrying. You know, the Justice of the Peace or something . . .
Money?  Well, I'm glad to hear somebody admit it. Do you suppose you could write a radio speech that would put that fellow over?
Do it, and I'll give you a hundred dollars a week.
Tomorrow night, before a crowd of fifteen thousand people, and talking over a nation-wide radio hook-up, John Doe will announce the formation of a third party.
What for? I gave you fifty just the other day.
The Websters!
What?
There's enough in it for a hundred speeches, things people ought to hear nowadays. You be careful of it, won't you dear?  It's always helped keep your father alive for me.
I'll tell you what I'll do. I get thirty dollars a week. I'll take twenty-five, twenty if necessary. I'll do anything you say.
The letter from John Doe.
We'll get a handwriting expert to—  What!
Say that again.
You made it up.
You're supposed to be a smart guy! If it was raining hundred dollar bills, you'd be out looking for a dime you lost some place.
Hurry up, Pop.
All right, boys, here he is.
Well, okay. But we don't want more than a couple o' hundred people in on this thing. Now the first thing I want is an exact copy of the John Doe letter in your own handwriting.
Yeah, but it's got everybody sore. Ads are being pulled—the Governor's starting a libel suit—what's more, they all know John Doe's a phoney—and they insist on seeing him.
Listen. If that guy lays an egg. I want to get something out of it. I'm getting a Jane Doe ready!
How many is that, six? Pretty hungry, weren't you?
Had any schooling?
What do you do when you work?
Hey, Doc, look. Look, Doc. Gimme that again, will yuh? Who's gonna get him?
Listen, sucker, yuh ever been broke?
Well, sir, about a dozen families got together and gave Grubbel a job watering their lawns. Isn't that wonderful? And then we found jobs for six other people and they've all gone off relief!
I gotta figure some way out of this thing!
Yeah, she's a heelot just like the rest of them. It's lucky you got away from her.
Four bits.
Join the John Doe Club.
Hello, Mr. Connell.
Listen, pal—this fifth column stuff's pretty rotten, isn't it?[11]
Is that so? Then what's a big political boss like Hammett doing in town? And a labor leader like Bennett? And a lot of other big shots who are up at D. B.'s house right now? Wolves, John, wolves waiting to cut up the John Does!  Wait till you get a gander at that speech you're gonna make tonight!
Go down to the office and arrange for some radio time.
I want it as soon as possible.
I see. I'd better stick to running the paper, huh?
Run a story. Say John Doe was in here, and is sorry he wrote the letter and—
What's your name?
That's a lie!
Yep. There was a major league scout there watching me, too. And he came down after the game with a contract. Do you know what?  I couldn't life my arm to sign it. But I'll be okay again as soon as I get it fixed up.
Racket? What do you mean?
Say, who's putting up this dough?
Then he may be caught on a ledge! Look again!
What's the line?
What happened? Is there a problem?
You gotta do this for me. I'm in here because of you.
Don't make do it, Mike.
Tell me what's wrong.
Tell my dad.
I hate fucking Springfield.
It's my job to see that no one gets killed, Earl... Including you.
Really?
Look, why don't you just come on back inside for a second.
We got a guy who's probably on drugs. He's got a record of 459's and he was busted on possession. But he's never been busted on a major felony. What's his demeanor?
You can't kill me like this.
You ever been in a hostage situation?
What's the point of this?
You don't like New York?
How are we gonna get him out of there?
We see each other every couple of months.
That's a lot of commitment. I admire that.
Lesson two, "Dead Eye"... should have been lesson one. Never exchange yourself for a hostage.
I can't do that.
You could say something like,  "Tell me what the scumbag's name is. Maybe we can work something out."
Get good at it.
What did you see?
Ronnie... Yeah, so.
They need to run first and second?
We won.
Is it always like this?
What the fuck is going on.
And what about the ones you don't save?
And what if you can't live with it?
McCall, you all right?
Roper. Metro Division. Hostage Negotiator. Give me the short version.
Is the hostage injured?
Oh, hell, forget it. This won't work.
Something I guess I can't have anymore.
You think I didn't need you?
It's already started.
What do you think?
It's not that world. It's your world. It's part of who you are.
Yeah?
Scottie?
Yeah.
Scott...
...at the top of the stretch it's Cozy Girl in front with Backtrack coming on... Cozy Girl by a length, Backtrack closing...
Are you going to make this hard for me?
Great, send him to the Marines. This guy's not a negotiator. He'll quit in two weeks.
Like ahh... I don't know...  Five thousand dollars.
The car is part of the deal.
Roper...
What have you promised them?
They have nothing to do with this --
Why?
This is how you pick up women --
The guests are here.
The patterns were moved around, but they weren't changed.
You are not a God.
The new world.
But what if he doesn't --
Where you plugged-in from?
What?
He had access to the keys --
Then what's with all the staffing programs in his account?
Need the disk back!
You went to my high-school?
Most nights you wake up crying. Never knowing why.
We worked together on the inside. You were on my programming team --
That's why they told you you can't go inside.  They can't have you running into her.
You said we were on the same programming team.
What?
I wasn't with you.
It was just there.
Program name?
Connection approved.  Ready to transmit --
Select uplink for Federal Communications Office.  Department of Enforcement.
We've got him locked!
WE CAN'T BREAK FREE!
In the language of the Nathadians, "Nin" stands for "man", "jetti" stands for "animal".  Ninjetti  - man and animal, together as one.  Now, put your hands inside the flame.
I heard that!
Let's teach these vermin a few manners.
That's pretty bad.
Release the power WITH the power.
It is said that to those who possess the Power... all things are possible.
I see... a fox
PTERODACTYL!
I am the wolf, cunning and swift!
Of course!  The power is of another world.  Another dimension.
NEW POWER COINS!!
009843... 42... 41!  WE'RE IN ALIGNMENT!
Be the eagle.  Be the eagle.
There goes the neighborhood.
SKULL!!
It's... an eagle?
As soon as we've taken over the world I'm gonna change my name to Sir Mordant.  Or how about MAJOR Mordant?!
Just shut your gap!
GET OFF ME!
Simon says...
What!
Don't you ever have anything nice to say?!
Six become one... the combined forces of the Ninjetti.
THREE SECONDS!!
What you're sayin' makes a lotta sense. Ya know, if I keep on killin' people like I have, I won't have no more friends left!
Ya still owe me fifty bucks for the train ticket.
One fuckin' year ago I had ta hit you up for train fare. Now I can buy the fuckin' train. And I ain't even a fuckin' Sicilian!
You ever been near a meat packing plant? My father makes a couple million per, but the smell in his office is enough to make you puke.
Up here, Boss.
Why should you be payin' me when we're all equals?
When my money moves, I go with it.
Scotch is a very valuable commodity these days.
I ain't mad. I ain't even surprised. But I can't let ya fuck me. On the other hand, if ya got needs beyond the thirty-five, I'll advance it to you against our next deal on the same terms.
I got my partner in there!
But Maranzano's got the men and the brains.
Bastard didn't even show.
The deal's too good, Frankie
I'm sorry, but I sleep better when I know I'm with the winning side.
No. They envy you.
What's the matter?
Come on. It's Christmas. At least stay for breakfast.
You got something to hide?
Have you thought about this?
Well, good. Woman like that you don't have to keep an eye on.
We're going to Atlantic City for the honeymoon.
We need to put together a meet for the whole country. We all got the same problems. We could talk. Meet the guys we don't know. Lift a few with the guys we do.
You bastards, I said twenty!
Tommy Reina's gone over to Maranzano, but so far Masseria ain't lifted a finger,
Meyer, ain't anybody ever told you ya look more like a bookkeeper than a fuckin' mobster?
It's just that Maranzano's the only bastard I ever heard brag about gettin' audited by the IRS. He came out clean, so he thinks his shit don't stink.
Yeah. So who the fuck does?
We're gonna change it, Bugs. Once we get rid of the Dons, the Commission's gonna rule. No more wars. No more vendettas. No more Boss of All the Bosses.
Tommy tells me that Capone's coming in from Chicago.
Where we headed?
And what went on your little party in Atlantic City. I got ears.
One move pardner, and you're a dead man.
Good liquor draws a good crowd.
Mussolini is raping Sicily like every Roman before him. So our brothers are coming to America. Soldiers willing to fight and die. Men who know the meaning of honor.
The Internal Revenue came to my offices. I turned over all my ledgers. They found nothing. Charlie, I am a businessman.
Sorry, Charlie. I gotta get my Johnson worked tonight.
So we're gonna knock 'em both off?
Yes?
How do you get from <u>here</u> - to <u>there</u>?
What?
Monkeybone?
What's the maximum safe dose?
Jeez, it all looks like bad late-night cable.
Three months. <i></i> There's always some brain damage. But at three months...the chances of coming back shrink dramatically with every day.
Herb, it's too much. It's all out of hand.
Herb. <u>I have to go</u>.
So here's my idea. We do a giveaway at the zoo benefit. We get a big piñata. We fill it with Monkeybone dolls - <u>hundreds</u> of 'em.
Holy shit.
The Nightmare Juice! It's gone! Somebody switched it for a beaker of grape Kool-Aid!!
Oh, baby, I can't believe you're back.
You're wearing a <u>topcoat</u>, Stu. - Where are your pants?
Did we just - <u>hit</u> something?
Kimmy! What's the matter?
Hypnos?
I'm so sorry, Stu. I <u>wanted</u> to tell you what was going on. I really, really liked you.
Don't ask where I got it.
Go. Just <u>go</u>.
You are too! Mooning over Julie when we could <u>both</u> be gettin' some o' this fine local action. It's not like she's gonna know. Out of town, under five minutes, and in a coma don't <u>count</u>.
He's ninety. He's practically dead already. How come <u>he</u> goes back and <u>I</u> stay here?
Y'call that art? Why, my three-year-old can paint better than that.
How'd <u>you</u> get in there?
He's taking her to the land of Death, right? So all we've gotta do is...hitch a ride! <i></i> Stop shaking! I'll protect you.
Oh, let me get out of your way then.
Is there something else I can do for you?
I wanted to ask you something.  Those motorcycles across the street ...?
... What are they all doing there?
Dating anyone?
Well, they were right out in plain view.
Don, this is my mother.  Mom, this is my boss, Don Palmer.
Mother, I ...
Mom, I need to talk to you.
I think you should consider coming out and staying with me longer.
Well, bye.  And have a safe trip ... and ... Paris in the spring!
Who is it?
She's at work.  I'm her mother.
Really?
I wonder what they do in there?  Don't they frighten you?  They all look so ...
Uh, yes.  My husband passed away recently ...
... And the children thought I should take a trip.
Ohhh.  Do you know the East Village?
--what possible explanation can you offer for this charge being--as you say--"trumped up" against you!
And you say you never signed this contract with Mr. Allen?
Getting on to dinner, isn't it, pal?
Oh--that again. Yeah.
No--don't do it. I'm sure. The truth is, Diz--there's no man I've seen yet or--must be something wrong with me. I've been feeling low for weeks.
What! Who?
Sit tight, Diz. The show commences in just a minute.
Ah. One of the supporting characters.
You play--left field.
Well--I stuck my foot in it again at the President's press conference today--  How come so early? Get the day off?
Oh--yeah--
Do you know how I felt, Diz?
Well--cut it out. See? Who *cares* anyway?
Okay. You don't mind?
Or angry little mountain streams-- and cattle moving against the sun. You haven't seen any of that, have you, Diz?
Where?
Nothing like--uh--Susan--or anything like that, huh?
The war's on!
Taylor, my dear.
I do *not* want a Senator. And I do *not* want any more of this nonsense! Emma!
Are you ready for him, Bill?
*Henry Hill?* That crackpot? That long-haired--! Why, you should have killed that so fast--!
I said forget 'em! Horace Miller goes to the Senate--and that settles it!
--a *boy ranger* a squirrel chaser-- to the United States Senate!
But you went ahead and made this appointment without asking me--
Yes! He's about to blow the whole machine to smithereens--and *you with it*, Mr. Governor!
Gosh, Pop--head of the Boy Rangers!
Well--it started with a little mimeograph sheet--and it's just grown out of all sense and reason--
Maybe you'd like to come along and watch, Governor? Jefferson's done a wonderful job with that leg.
I just can't, son--not the head and tail both!
Gee, I wouldn't appoint an old twerp like Horace Miller--Taylor or no Taylor!
My pigeons--I better see about my pigeons.
He's a newspaper publisher I know-- and--
Where were you?
Ma's told me about it a thousand times.
I mean, sir--if I'm going to stay in the Senate--I ought to know what I'm doing--at least, I ought to try to study the Bills that are coming up--
Yes, I was--
Senator Paine, if I could do just that one thing while I'm here, I-- I'd feel that I--
Thank you, sir. Thank you for your time.
I'm sorry! Gee! I hope--
Gosh!  Well--looks good as new. If there *is* any damage, I'll--
It does!
I have no defense against forged papers and--
Yes, sir, I yield for a question.
Yes, Ma?
*No*!
Is--is something the matter?
One of those sightseers--you know. You see, I--gosh, I've never been called absent-minded or... but there it was all of a sudden--looking right at me through one of the station doors--
Go out to Mount Vernon. It'd be a sort of fine thing to do--see Washington's home just before walking into the Senate for the first time-- don't you think?
No, gee--I couldn't stay here--
Pardon me. Senator Paine decided this *with* you?
If I were *triplets*, I couldn't--. Look, Senator--let me give you a rough idea. A member has a Bill in mind--like you--a camp. Right?
Oh, yes. And *I'm* helping. Simple-- and I'm helping. So we knock this off in record-breaking time of--let's say three or four days--
You get to your feet in the Senate and present it. Then you take the Bill and put it in a little box-- like a letter box--on the side of the rostrum. Just hold it between thumb and forefinger and drop it in. Clerks read it and refer it to the right committee--
That's how Congress--or any large body--is run. All work has to be done by committee.
Good. Where are we?
That's the order of business. Your Bill has to stand *way* back there in line unless the Steering Committee decides it is important enough to be--
A committee of the majority party leaders. They decide when a Bill is important enough to be moved up toward the head of the list--
Well, anyway, it's *something* like that--  And it *is* important. That--that Steering Committee has *got* to see it that way. And I'm sure Senator Paine will do all he can--  He's a fine man, Miss Saunders, isn't he? He knew my father, you know.
But you've had beautiful country all around you. You've just had to life up your eyes!
I take it your--your parents couldn't-- uh--
I never met anyone more--more intelligent--or capable. I--I don't know where I'd be on this bill of mine without your help--
Saunders. That's better.  Good morning, Saunders. Hello, Saunders. How's the bill coming, Saunders--?
Yeah. Yeah. Well, anyway, we've got "Saunders" settled. Maybe that was my trouble all along.  YEs, *sir*. I'm all ready to go now--  What's your *first* name?
Well--nobody calls you anything but Saunders.
Clarissa. Oh. Uh-huh.  Well, Saunders--let's go--
Uh--Willet Creek. It's just a little stream--
What do they--? Who are all those--?
Do you mean all--look--look we'd better open them up--see what they say here--look at the money--what does it say--"Dear Senator Smith, I would like to come to your boy's camp and I shine shoes at the station and here's nine cents." Oh, isn't that wonderful. Look and he signs it. "Yours truly, Stinky Moore." Isn't that marvelous?  Say--have I got some paper here?
No! Letters. I've got to write to the Rangers and Ma--and--I'm bustin' with news! Why, I've introduced a bill! Me--Jeff Smith. I got up and talked in the Senate! 
Hello.
It might save some of the pieces, Jeff. It would leave a doubt about the whole thing--about you. Might blow over, this way.
Where do we go from here?
Jeff--wait--they want you to speak!
A camp! Well!
How--how do you do, Miss Paine?  I--I apologize for looking like this-- I--I have to be going now--
Uh--that's good. And--uh--you?
Oh, the bill. Oh--splendid--I mean--  I--I just can't seem to talk in this suit.  I'll tell you a secret. It's brand new.
Funnier things have happened. Ma says when Pa was courting her, he acted strange for months. Didn't make sense--or anything. And one day, on a hunch, Ma said: "Clayton, so help me, you talk like a man whose collar is too tight to bear." "Not the collar, Mary," he said, "my shoes." "Well, for land's sake," Ma said, "Take the pesky things off!" Which Pa did, an' they were engaged within a week.
However, Senator Smith is still a member of this Body and as such has equal claim on the attention of the Chair--
Order, gentlemen!
I said--I mean--Washington didn't live to see it finished. Congress didn't move here from Philadelphia till eighteen hundred.
Ax?
I wouldn't wait if I were you.
Eleven B Street, Northeast. Take his bags and your own right over--and get yourself a room in the same place--
What are you driving at? You want *me* to get him to sign that?
Well--me, too!
Joe--I've got a lot of people to take care of in this State.
Wait a minute, boys. Happy may have hit on something tremendous here. Rather than let Miller or anyone else in at this stage, we simply put blinders on this simple son of nature-- and turn him loose on monuments. He's completely out of the way in Washington, and as Happy says, you make political capital out of it at home.
Jeff--this is Mr. Taylor.
Jim--the boy's talking to that State-- the story is out--!
I hit him from the floor with everything I knew!
How nice.
Mr. President...
Mr. President! Will the Senator yield?
I accuse this man--by his tone--by his careful denials--he is deliberately trying to plant damaging impressions of my conduct--! *I'll* tell you why we were in tht room. Because Mr. Taylor, a respected citizen of our State, had brought with him the evidence against this man, later presented from this floor, and *we were urging him to resign*-- !
Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?
Good morning.
I say, my friend, do you know a fellow by the name of Longfellow Deeds?
Pixilated.
He walks in the rain, without his hat, and talks to himself.
Why, you own it, Longfellow.
Why, everybody in Mandrake Falls in pixilated - except us.
Oh, yes.
All right, Mr. Dodsworth. I think you'll qualify.  Take this to that desk over there for further instructions.
You don't go out with girls very much, do you?
Thank you, Your Honor. Are you employed by the Morning Mail?
Did you subsequently write a series of articles about him?
And you saw them happen?
Tell me more about yourself.
What?
Sure. I met you.
Gosh, you look pretty tonight.
Huh?  Oh. They said I was crazy. Said I wanted to run it like a grocery store.
Would you like to walk the rest of the way? It's so nice out.
Now, what do you see?
Here's a nice place.
You said I was a lady in distress.
Oh, yes. I used to have a lot of fun there when I was a little girl. I used to love to go fishing with my father. That's funny. He was a lot like you, my father was. Talked like you, too. Sometimes he'd let me hold the line while he smoked - and we'd just sit there for hours. And after awhile, for no reason, I'd go over and kiss him and sit in his lap. He never said very much but once I remember him saying: "No matter what happens, honey, don't complain."
Oh, I suppose you could do better.
Couldn't sleep. Kinda wanted to talk to you. Do you mind?
You know what I've been doing since I got home? Been working on a poem.  It's about you.  Sometimes it's kinda hard for me to say things - so I write 'em.
Do you mind if I talk to you, Mary? You don't have to pay any attention to me.
What's up, Babe? Something's eating you.
Why there she is!  Of course she's home.  Stupid of me . . .
Look, I can do it!
Oh, he's not getting away with anything.
Did it?
What's bothering you, huh?
Proposed to you! You mean he asked you to marry him?
What're you going to do?
Yeah. Mac threw Cobb out again.
Ow! My foot's asleep!
don't want to be critical, John, but here it is—
Will you show Mr. Hallor to the front door?
You can't come up here!
We'll send for the police!
He's what?
You will please permit Mr. Deeds to finish.
Yeah. A glorified doormat.
Look!
Well, your uncle was Chairman of the Board of Directors. They probably expect you to carry on.
Mr. Deeds, does the name of Martin W. Semple mean anything to you?
Are you a married man, Mr. Deeds?
Saving a lady in distress, eh? Well, I suppose we all have dreams like that when we are young.  Incidentally, we'd better get started. You'll have to pack.
It's merely a suggestion. I don't wish to press the point, Mr. Deeds, but if you'll give me your Power of Attorney we'll take care of everything. It'll save you a lot of petty annoyances. Every shark in town will be trying to sell you something.
Why not? Who is he?
Sit down. Sure I couldn't get you a glass of lemonade or something?
Sounds like a two weeks' notice to me.
That's funny. Why is that?
Name your poison and I'll supply it.
I don't remember. "Cinderella Man!" What do they mean by that?
But what about this "Cinderella Man"?
Just as I suspected, wise guy! I don't mind you making a sap out of yourself - but you made one out of me, too.
Naturally.
Here's the order for the plows. We got a good price on them.
Yes, sir.
Well, what about it, Mr. Deeds?
You're making a mistake, Mr. Deeds.
There's one nice thing about being rich - you ring a bell and things happen. When the servant comes in, Mr. Hallor, I'm going to ask him to show you to the door. Many people don't know where it is.
No - I don't want it, thank you.
I'd like to get in my two cents' worth.
Mr. Deeds, you haven't yet touched upon a most important thing. This rather fantastic idea of yours to want to give away your entire fortune. It is, to say the least, most uncommon.
Brookfield just came in.
Oh, what a magnificent deflation of smugness. Pal, you've added ten years to my life!  A poet with a straight left and a right hook - delicious! Delicious!  You're my guest from now on - forever and a day - even unto eternity!
Who are they?
He's got a lot of foolish notions - about saving a lady in distress.
Yes, sir.
I'd better call her up and apologize. I don't remember taking her home last night.
What do you mean? I remember everything!  Hand me my pants - I wrote her phone number on a piece of paper.
Yes, sir. I beg pardon, sir, but did you ever find what you were looking for, sir?
But she's on the telephone—
It's the kids, you know, not Jeremy. He had nothing to do with this -- except pay, of course. He's always willing to pay. He's extremely generous.  I'm so humiliated that my own children would threaten me.
I said... you must come out to the house for dinner on Thursday.
-- The argument had nothing to do with it.
I had ordered some books. "The 100 Greatest Books Ever Written."
Oh, all the great writers -- Shakespeare, Charles Dickens, Moby Dick... those people. Each is bound in genuine premium leather with 22 carat gold accents. It's a magnificent set -- and only $33.50 per volume. Right away you get Great Expectations for just $6.99.
I know I shoulda come to your office. I was gonna, actually, but then when you walked in here today...
It's my daughter Sofie... she's gotta problem.
You're the shrink, aren't you?
But you do therapy?
But they're certainly dead. And yes, personally, I find it a bit odd.
Interesting approach. What was his name?
I see.
My guess is these images were burned into your brain when you were young. Maybe if we could nail down the exact fantasies that are haunting you -- maybe you could get past them... Anyway, I thought we could try an experiment.
I didn't see you there. Can I help you?
I think you'll like this. Know much about Cuban cigars?
Althea hasn't told you?
Are you disrespecting this court, Mr. White?
So, is this like a Japanese restaurant?
Does the phrase "nosy" have any meaning to you, Lily?
What do you want to know?
How ya doin', Ainge? Evenin', Lily.
They come through a few times each year.  Hello, Mrs. Saito, good to see you again!  It's a tour.
Lily, I want you to meet Skip. Skip, Lily.
Doc...
Don't you at least have a back door I can use?
It's a country club. Don't worry about it.
What's wrong with her?
It'll never happen! You're in big trouble, mister.
I think you do.
Just who is here, can you tell me?
Sofie. It's so obvious... you're after my daughter.
No.
I don't know. I barely made it today.
Is it contagious? 'Cause everyone agrees my immune system's way down.
I'm not making any promises.
We don't discuss it.
Please... forgive me.
I've offended you!
No, not really. They're about the same. My marriage was one long headache.
There... I've given myself a real whopper.
It doesn't matter. Go on.
And he's where?
I'm thinking a gal could make a good living doing this. How hard could it be squeezing out some fourteen year old?
-- you've been a tremendous help to me.
Yes! And my ex-husband -- he never accepted me for who I was, just like Mother. The things you've said have helped me understand what a dick he is.
Is it something you've heard about me?
The point is this -- I am not a blank page. I did not just fall off the turnip truck. Do you know what I mean?
I know a little about psychology. I took three different courses in college. It's true, none of them were above the two hundred level, but I took them... And there was one concept I remember very well.
Sofie...
...How violated I feel?
We're only talking about six weeks.
Don't do that thing...  ...that shrink thing.
Pro boner?  Pro bono, huh? For whose good, supposedly?
These appointments were not my idea, remember.
...I mean, Doc, the dude is seriously deluded. I said that to him, I said, "If you think I'm gonna do all that shit for you, man, you are seriously deluded."
What did he want you to do?
..."Find the need and fill it" my dad used to say -- I guess a lot of dads say that -- but I did and it just took off.
Would you like another beer?
Amazing.
How many sessions have we had now, Doc?  Six. And it's been good... like we were two buddies hanging out. Just shootin' the shit.
All right, I'm just gonna tell you, as simple and direct as I can.  And you understand that this is a big secret? Just between us?  Okay. You know I've got this gift for certain kinds of... machines.
Of course, him being insane didn't make it all right that I fell in love with his wife.
And a birth certificate is enough?
I've never brought anyone down here before.
I'm here for you, Doc.
It's possible. I don't know about that.
I trained in the east, myself -- Cornell -- and I don't care what anyone says, there really are regional differences. I found the state certification exams out here quite harrowing... Did you?
And what ritual would that be?
Oh yes, of course.
Goin' somewhere?
Oh yeah,... sorry bout that.  So who's this guy?
I'm sorry, it was an accident.
You put up with me, because I can read and write ancient Egyptian, decipher hieroglyphs and hieratic, and I'm the only person within a thousand miles who knows how to properly code and catalogue this library.
And you think this justifies killing innocent people!?
I'm thinking that if the black Book Of The Dead can bring people back to life --
So your sayin', if we find the book made outta gold --
You think it'll send this guy back to hell?
The hell with this. I'm goin, downstairs to get me a drink. You want somethin'?
Could you tell me how to get there? The exact location?
Sorry, didn't mean to scare ya.
There's something out there, you know, something under that sand.
I don't believe in fairy tales and hokum, Mister O'Connell, but I do believe that one of the most famous books in history is buried out there, The Book Of The Living. It's what first interested me in Egypt as a child. It's why I came here, sort of a life's pursuit.
Relax! I'm the map!  It's all up here.
According to Bembridge Scholars, inside the statue of Anubis was a secret compartment, perhaps containing The Book Of The Living.
Yes, they never used it because they feared it so. It's written, that if a victim of the HOM-DAI should ever arise, he would bring with him the ten plagues of Egypt.
You called me your girl?
Don't do it, Evelyn.
You...! YOU...!
Oh yes I do! I have something right here!
Ah, begging your pardon, but shouldn't we be going?
It's called mummification. You're dead when they do this
Juicy?
I found it, Evy! I found it
What do I do, Evy!? What do I do!?
Ummm, Hootash im... Hootash im now what is this last symbol here?
Ah! Ah! Ahmenophus!
Tough break.
What?
Do I?
Come on, baby!
Atta, girl!
Who are you?
And you can't count Horst Buckholtz anyway.
How about... the Savage Six?
Casanova said that in two days the entire city would belong to him... and there wasn't a thing that we could do about it.
Yes!
Elizabeth! Little Elizabeth! Why you're so... middle aged!
Doc, these are my friends. We're superheroes, and we need your help.
What did you do with Captain Amazing?
Thanks for reminding me which team I'm on.
Are you an actress?
Who's the artist?
I'd better go.
Who?
Or talk?
You know what? Underneath all that anger I think there's just a little boy who wants everyone to love him.
You're the Sphinx.
We're all the same really. Our songs, our dreams, our seeds are all just a brave attempt to live forever. 
Oh don't start that again --
What are you talking about?
You sure that's how you spell it?
There's just not enough of us.
We need a break, that's all! Nobody'd ever heard of him until he busted Casanova Frankenstein!
Maybe you should try a more romantic approach.
I'm soaked.  Oh great.
So you're only invisible... to yourself?
So you're only invisible, when absolutely no one is looking at you?
Firepower costs money.
Jeffrey!
What are you doing in the silver drawer?
Oh, Mother, I'm sorry. I know how much you wanted me to be a doctor or a lawyer with a family -- but it's just not who I am!
I use it... to fight evil.
This is bad.
Do we have to?
And a social life.
That was too close.
But, since the fire, a completely new spirit has been aroused in the nation.  The French have become an army of criminals, against whom Russia must be avenged, against whom she is now prepared to fight to the death.
Well, that is a very interesting idea, General Kutusov, but I can assure you that Napoleon is no beginner at this.  Whatever analysis you have done on this situation, I am sure that he has gone over the same ground.
And, what a great pleasure it is, indeed, to meet you, Alexander.
Ah, my dear friend, come in, come in.  Please sit down.
To be perfectly honest, I haven't the vaguest idea.
Is this enough to oppose 40,000 men?
But where are my wife and son? What's become of them?  Where is Marmont?  Where is Mortier?
But did she have the best doctors? Wasn't there any chance at all to save her?
Ah, my poor Josephine.  She was the most alluring, most glamorous creature I have ever known -- a woman in every sense of the word, and she had the kindest heart in the world.  She may have been a liar and a spendthrift, but she had something that was irresistible -- she was a women to her very fingertips... How impossible it is to believe that she is dead.
Who is there?
Read it back.
This dispatch has just arrived from Aboukir, marked highest priority, for General Bonaparte's eyes only.
Bastia -- and you?
I haven't been there for three years.
Why are you carrying the dog?
When you eat him, may I have some?
Why didn't you wake me then?
The Emperor has decided to marry your Archduchess, Marie-Louise.
Earlier this afternoon, the Emperor refused the hand of the Grand Duchess Anna, of Russia, and, as I'm sure you can appreciate, he is quite able to change his mind again.  For the Emperor, to choose a wife, is only a matter of minutes.
That is correct.
Ah, my dear Francis, what a genuine pleasure it is to meet you at last.
Shall we move closer to the fire?
Oh...?
Thank you, Napoleon.
The weather is terrible, isn't it, sir?
You must be chilled to the bone, standing out of doors like this.
No, I'm only here on leave.  My regiment is at Valence.
Well, it must be a good deal warmer than it is here on the street.
Uh-hh... yes, of course -- if you would like to go... there... but... I have very little money.
Naturally, one does not take much stock in such a piece of filth but, on the other hand, it is not the sort of thing one can simply ignore. What do you think, Joseph?
Yes, of course, I would.  You know I am not one of your wife's greatest admirers, but I certainly know nothing about this.
Of course not, but such violence of feeling makes me wonder.
Oh, it's not the slightest inconvenience, General Bonaparte. It is an honor to have you here.
Were you in love with him?
But you have had mistresses while you were away.
Were any of them prettier than I am?
Promise.
Yes -- what is it?
Yes!!
Oh -- I didn't tell you... I've seen Dr. Corvisart, and he was very reassuring and encouraging.  He has had excellent results with the waters of Plombiers, and he thinks it would be a good idea for me to spend a few weeks there. Apparently, he sent Madame Le Floch there last year, and she gave birth to twins.
Well, maybe he's only looking out for your best interests.
You couldn't face telling me what?
You could hear them?
Can you give me a drink, please?
And, where did you see my portrait?
Papa said only to comply with any request you might make of me.
Article 46, calls for the virtual dismemberment of Prussia, reducing her population by half and her army to a token force.
Those are extremely harsh terms.
And where do you place Alexander?
A revolution is not a polite discussion in a parlor, Citizen Lieutenant.  One does not call it murder to kill such vermin.
What did you say his name was?
Come in.
Napoleon was born at Ajaccio in Corsica on August 15th, 1769.  He had not been a healthy baby and his mother, Letizia, lavished him with care and devotion.  In middle age, he would write about her from St. Helena.
Led by the warlike Queen Louisa, and her fashion-minded husband, King Frederich Wilhelm, the Prussians still believed themselves cast in the mold of Frederick the Great, and more than a match for Napoleon.  The King had a special collection of 60 splendid uniforms, and was personally involved in the design of all the Prussian army uniforms.
Send Betty my love.  Boy you looking good.  I'mma take these in the house for you, man... and when you finish with this cat, come inside.  I got something to show you.
Well, let me in.
Y'all never use it?
Who are you?
What's the green stuff poking out?
Naw, I already ate.
It's about to work, just come on.
Dude, dogs hate me.  I don't know why. Me and K-9's just don't get along.
Who is that?
Restraining order?  Where the hell you meet this girl?
Damn, you got a stalker.
Yo know what?  I'm starting to like Rancho Cucamonga.
What's the matter?
It works.
You see that?
Yeah, air.
You make it sound so easy.
You go first.
Hello, remember me?
Most definitely.
Huh?
Delivery!
Here I come!
Must be your upper lip, 'cause I don't smell nothing.
I gotta get'em fixed.  They don't roll down.
Look, Roach, I know you ain't never worked in a record shop before and you're a little excited.  But if Pinky catches you doing that X-Games shit off his counter top, we both getting fired.  You feel me?
I say we go over there and kick their asses.  I can take the little one.
Roach...Roach, come on.
Where did Craig move to?
What you say?
Rancho Cucamonga?
Ezal!  Ezal!
Make sure you look after my son out here. Don't get him involved with none of your bullshit, Roy.
Somebody left me a message.  Well where's Craig and Day-Day?
Craig, I want you to meet my old lady, Suga.  Suga, this is Craig.
Elroy, what happen?
You just come in on Amtrack?
Somebody close?
Look...I've... I've got a problem. A big problem...
I need your help.
You were saying?  Your daughter....?
Mrs. Grant, Governor...I won't hurt you.
You were very nervous.
How do you know that?
Who did?
What?
There's only one way to find out for sure. Try to cancel the last speech.
It's the last chance they have for me to kill you. Try to get out of it. They won't let you. They can't. Try to change the schedule and you'll know I'm right. What have you got to lose? It comes down to who you trust, them or me? Test them.
For what?
Could I see some identification, sir?
Come with us, sir.
This is for you. In it there is a picture of a woman and an itinerary. It is her itinerary. She is presently - are you listening, Mr. Watson?
What about the gun?
What...?
You killed him.
I kill her - and you kill me.
Come back.
My wife always said I had a problem trusting people.
I don't know.
The man following me has a walkie- talkie. If he sees I'm not here he'll call his partner. I do anything out of line and he'll send the word to kill my daughter.
Who is this? Are you sure we can trust him?
We have to hurry.
Now, see, this is why you should always wear a helmet and knee pads. You never know when you're going to fall down and go boom. Right?
He has to say "over and out". Daddy, you have to say "over and out".
Will you promise me that?
I said I have to do something.
You got anything smaller?
Can I get out to Flower Street from here?
Something is going to happen. When it's over you'll know what I was talking about.
Cover your mouth.
Meet Irene.
For the last time, I don't want it cleaned. Now get the hell out of here!
Hey!
Goddamnit, you fuckin' bum, come here!
He brought a gun onto the pool deck.
He got onto the pool deck with a gun. How did he get past her Security carrying a
Where are we going?
I've got something for you.
Get moving.
You talk to a cop, you even look at a cop too long and your daughter is dead.  Do it.
Yeah.
Put her on.
He was a cool one, that Harper. Never broke.
Think of it, Ben! With that cursed, bloodied gold!
Salvation is a last-minute business, boy.
Won't he bust it, Uncle Birdie?
Got a good buy in soap, Miz Cooper.
Draggin' the name of the Lord through the evil mud of his soul!
He taken the Lord's name in vain and he trampled on His Holy Book!
Willa Harper there is certain plain facts of life that adds up just like two plus two makes four and one of them is this: No woman is good enough to raise growin' youngsters alone! The Lord meant that job for two!
If ever I saw a Sign from Heaven!
Pearl dotes on him.
She tarried around the kitchen after I'd gone up, and when I went downstairs to see what was wrong...
I tried to save her.
John...
Where's Mom?
Please be quiet -- Oh please, Pearl!
Get in the skiff, Pearl, goodness, goodness, hurry!
Don't you hurt her!
I'm butcherin' my hog myself, smokin' the hams, and cannin' the sausage.  You-all have your work cut out!
This watch is the nicest watch I ever had.
Did you hear what I said, son?
Married! We have decided to go to Sistersville tomorrow, and when we come back --
What are you doing, boy?
I thought I told you to keep your mouth shut --
All right boy: where's the money?
Now where, boy? Mind; no tricks. I can't abide liars.
I'll tell you a secret.
Why, pray tell?
Surely. I'd like to talk to you, my dear.
Harry!
You thought, Willa, that the moment you walked in that door I'd start in to pawing you in the abominable way men are supposed to do on their wedding night. Ain't that right, now?
It's the business of our marriage to mind those two you have now -- not to beget more.
You were listening outside the parlor window.
You're Miz Cooper, I take it.
Shall I tell ye the little story of Right-Hand-Left-Hand -- the tale of Good and Evil?
What do you want?
You'll whip me!
What'd you all talk about?
They're just simple tests, Nan. We'll both be right here.
What the hell's going on!?
You okay?
M'god, I look twenty years old.  You have any weird dreams last night?
Okay?
Whenever I get nervous I eat.
What happens if they don't do that?
Bring him out of what?
Rod's not a lunatic.
You used me, daddy!
He's dangerous.
Hello Nancy.
I've got a proposition for you. Listen very carefully, please.
Lieutenant Thompson. Sorry to wake you, but --
Looks like her boyfriend did it. Rod Lane. Musician type, arrests for brawling, dope --
Maybe god's punishing us all...
Nancy, don't fall asleep in there.
Mother, for petesakes.
You okay?
I must be going nuts...
You okay?
It's real, Mamma. Feel it.
What's with the bars?
Mom, I want to know what you know about Fred Krueger.
Feeling better?
No.
What you mean 'all at once'?
I can't believe his mother let him come over here.
What you dream?
Bring me forty-five back.
Good evening, Anna.
An omelet! Aren't you living a little above your ration?
That's just it. It makes people feel queer. I dont' want you to get in any trouble.
You know how it is today... all you have to do is wear a pair of silk stockings and they suspect you of counter-revolution.
A dress you wear in the evening.
What is it, Anna?
You want this?
Comrades! Comrades! Don't let's give in so quickly. After all we have to uphold the prestige of Russia.
You wouldn't like Razinin.
You must help us, Leon... if you don't win her over we're on our way to Siberia!
Can you blame them?... at least the May Day parade is over.
Let's fill it with confitures, des prunes...
Yes! We could stay with Leon!
What a lovely room you have here.
She's right...  anyhow let's talk ourselves into it.
Is there anything I can do for you, monsieur?
May I ask how much your rooms are?
This is the apartment we have reserved for you, Comrade Yakushova. I hope you like it.
Do you spell Buljanoff with one or two f's?
Don't forget, the day will come when you will have to face Razinin.
And there is a Russian saying: "The cat who has cream on his whiskers had better find good excuses."
Guest?
You think because you represent the former Duchess...
Not that we are giving in one inch, but tell us... what is in your mind?
About this telegram to Moscow. Why should you bother? I'll write it for you.
Have you?
And Gaston, I was happier all day long. I felt I'd contributed something.
They hope the settlement will bring you a fortune.
Is this satisfactory?
They tell me when you ring once the valet comes in; when you ring twice you get the waiter; and do you know what happens when you ring three times? A maid comes in -- a French maid.
I don't want to go to the Hotel Terminus.
Leon, my little boy.
This is a fine thing. Maybe we've missed him already.
Let's do that.
...des petites fraises des bois... de la crème de Bretagne... 
There's something in Constantinople... something irresistible....
We don't want to be disturbed.
Well, gentlemen... how about a little lunch?
Comrade Buljanoff...
How much does this cost?
A week?
Only myself and two other girls. One is a cello player in the opera and the other a street-car conductor.
What's new?
I am ashamed to put the picture of Lenin in a room like this.  Comrades, your telegram was received with great disfavor in Moscow.
We dealt directly with the representative of the Grand Duchess. I am sure if we call him he will give you a very clear picture.
We cannot feed the Russian people on your intentions. Fifty per cent to a so-called Duchess!... Half of every loaf of bread to our enemy! Comrade Kopalski, go at once to our Embassy and get the address of the best lawyer in Paris.
Pardon me, I am very interested in what you just said -- you mean when an envoy goes back to Russia -- if they don't like what he has done they put him out of the way?
She must have her little joke.  You're not going to take that seriously.
I want to see a friend of mine... a very dear friend.... It's a personal matter which has nothing to do with politics or social philosophies.... It's a girl.
I must get into that country of yours!
Now look here... you advertise all over the world that you want people to go into your country and when someone tries to get in, you keep him out!
You, please.
Yes. Could you give me some information?
Thank you.
Facing north... I'd hate to commit myself without my compass... Pardon me... are you an explorer?
For my own information would you call your approach toward me typical of the local morale?
You are very sure of yourself, aren't you?
Then you don't want me to go there.
Good evening, comrade.  This man is horribly old. You should not make him work.
Well, may I offer you a drink, or how about something to eat?
What do we do now?
You are bringing in wrong values. Love is a romantic designation for a most ordinary biological, or shall we say chemical, process. A lot of nonsense is talked and written about it.
It is out of the question. If you wish to approach me...
Room service speaking.
Just an old man. His memory is getting weak.
Ha! Ha! Now go back.
Probably not.
I wish they had never met.
You remember this room?
Well, first I should like to take off my hat and jacket.  Then could we have some music?
No... go on.
Leon, I would like to ask you something.
If you don't want to answer, you needn't. But if you do, you must tell me the truth.
I suppose she is very entertaining... It must be lots of fun to be with her, so witty, so glamorous...
Leon, don't ever ask me for a picture of myself... I couldn't bear the thought of being shut up in a drawer... I couldn't breathe, I couldn't stand it.
It's funny to look back. I was brought up on goat's milk, I had a ration of vodka in the army, and now champagne.
From what I read I thought champagne was a strong drink. It's very delicate. Do people ever get drunk on this?
Quickly, please... tell me one of your funny stories.
Go on.
But, darling, you can't do that.
Quite right... yes, yes, yes, but first you're going in that door and you're going to take a little spirits of ammonia and lie down.
Yes, sweetheart... all by ourselves.
It wouldn't be fair to the man in the street.  There they are... they are terrible things, those jewels....
Trying to keep me away from you! It couldn't be done. Naturally I couldn't go on forever punching passport officials in the nose -- but I found a way, didn't I? Darling, I had to see you. I wrote and wrote but all my letters came back.
Hello, Leon!
Those newspaper people?
Oh, Leon!
First tell me, are you my little Volga boatman?
I've got one chapter Guizot thinks is terrific. "Caviar and Blood." Swana escapes over the ice!
Did I hear something about jewels?
Thank you.
Yes, Swana, you did.
There's a charming crowd here tonight, isn't there?
Did I act stupidly last night? Should I apologize?
Leon! This has the ugly sound of regeneration.
Knowing the efficiency of the French Air Service I think I can guarantee that Madame Yakushova has already taken off for Moscow.
She's gone, Leon.
That does it, Swana.  Now you mustn't miss your appointment with your hair-dresser.
Not at all.... I understand perfectly, Count d'Algout gave you a dog. You made it very clear, madame.
How stale last night's gaiety looks! It has the taste of a dead cigarette.
I just dropped in to have a little heart-to-heart talk with you.
My palace in Petrograd... yes, you took that away from me. You took away my czar, my country, my people, everything I had...  but nothing more -- I warn you.
I wouldn't waken Leon. After last night I would say not before three o'clock at the earliest.
Where are they?
Where are they?
My lawyer agrees with you. He says France will uphold it in every court, but I will drag you through every court, don't forget that. And when I say it will take two years I am, as always, conservative.
No, I just wanted to be absolutely impartial. Both of us are faced with two rather uncomfortable years. We can condense these two years to two minutes if you want to accept my proposition. Ninotchka now realizes what she is after.
You mean you have finished the whole investigation?
That's marvelous.... You must have worked day and night.... Don't you ever sleep?
Well, Comrade, have you heard from your friends Kopalski, Buljanoff, and Iranoff?
I appreciate the confidence you show in me, but I must ask you to entrust someone else with this mission. I should hate to interrupt my present work. I am positive that my survey is more important than finding out whether three of our comrades have been drinking some extra glasses of champagne.
This way, madame. Are you alone? By the window perhaps?  Or a nice little corner table?
Your Highness, forgive this intrusion, but...
I am sorry... I have to leave.
You're lawyers.  How can you let this shit go by!  Look!  This?  Nixon can't say this.
For Christ's sake, it soils my mother's memory.  Do you think I want the whole goddamn world to see my mother like this?  Raising a dirty mouth!
He says if he doesn't get it right away, he's going to blow us out of the water.  And he means it.  Ever since his wife died in the plane crash, he's been over the edge.
Executive clemency ...
We could get that.
I understand that, sir.
I was sorry to hear about your wife.
Let's not forget they're just kids, they don't vote.
Yeah ... Sullivan thinks Henry's leaking.  He's the one ...
It's a code or something.
They went after Castro.  In some crazy way it got turned on Kennedy.  I don't think the "P" knows what happened, but he's afraid to find out.  It's got him shitting peach pits.
Eight words back in '72 -- "I covered up.  I was wrong.  I'm sorry" -- and the American public would've forgiven him.  But we never opened our mouths, John.  We failed him.
Mitchell's out of his mind now. Martha just put her head through a plate-glass window.
I like it.  I like the idea.
Oh, I suppose you would've just let them take over.  These aren't fraternity pranks, John.  It's anarchy.  A revolution!
Why not?
What about England?
This is June twentieth?
No, sir, you did not.
It's the President's personal property!  I will never give up my tapes to a bunch of Kennedy-loving Harvard Democrat cocksuckers!
Let 'em try!  I appointed three of those bastards!  I'm not giving 'em my tapes!
Who the fuck does Cox think he is?  I never made a dime from public office!  I'm honest.  My dad died broke.  You know the sonofabitch went to law school with Jack Kennedy? ... The last gasp of the Establishment! They got the hell kicked out of 'em in the election, so now they gotta squeal about Watergate 'cause we were the first real threat to them in years. And by God, Al, we would have changed it, changed it so they couldn't have changed it back in a hundred years, if only ...
Who?
"Victory at Sea," Al ... Henry.  The Pacific Theatre.  Christ, you can almost feel the waves breaking over the decks.
Your lawyers feel it's the ... "smoking gun."
Sir, the deadline is today.
Sir, you talked about opening up the whole "Bay of Pigs" thing again.
... they smelled the blood on me this time, Al.  I got soft.  You know ... that rusty, metallic smell ...
It came over from Vietnam, you know.
But O'Brien doesn't even use that office.  The Democrats've moved to Miami.  There's nothing there!
Their fourth!
I did?
Uh, no one, of course, is going to see these tapes, but ...
It's got nothing to do with justice. It's national security.
This isn't a "moral" issue, Bob.  We have to keep our enemies at bay or our whole program is gonna go down the tubes.  The FBI is filled with people who are pissed that I put Gray in and not one of their own.  Vietnam, China, the Soviet Union: when you look at the big picture, Bob, you'll see we're doing a hell of a lotta good in this world.  Let's not screw it up with some shit-ass, third-rate burglary.
Cue the crowd.  Go to the woman's group.  Get the bald guy, he's great ...
If they didn't tell Kennedy about Track 2, how did Hoover find out?
... never complain, never explain, John ...
We really must go, Mr. President.
And his staff.  Come on, the copy they were filing from China was great.
The blacks are lost, the "schwartzes" are gone ...
Gentlemen, I think it's about time for us to be getting to the airport.
You know, they all miss the point. Probably our biggest achievement as an administration, when it's all said and done, isn't China or Russia.  It's pulling out of Vietnam without a right wing revolt.
I promised Iran to Townsend.
Richard ... come with me, would you ...
Please!  I'll never let you down again, Mother.  Never.  I promise.
It's meant to make us stronger.  Thou art stronger than Harold ... stronger than Arthur.  God has chosen thee to survive ...
Not if I give you all the cards ...
Mr. Castro.
We have recent intelligence that a Soviet nuclear submarine has docked at Cienfuegos.
Not if you have spies in the White House, it isn't your job.
CIA policy?  The CIA has no policy, Mr. Helms.  Except what I dictate to you ...  I try to adjust to the world as it is today, not as you or I wanted it to be ten years ago.
This is an extremely dangerous direction, Mr. President.  Terrible consequences can result from such enormous errors in judgement.
No.  They make me sick.  They smell like death ... I had two brothers die young.  But let me tell you, there are worse things than death.  There is such a thing as evil.
I want to see him tomorrow, Clyde.
My father built the house where I was born with his own hands.  Oh, it wasn't a big house ...
Oh, my goodness ...
Can't we just talk here?  I've got the police chiefs in San Diego.
Roselli?  Johnny Roselli?
I never met the man.
Jesus, I'd like to book him into a psychiatrist's office.  He comes in here ranting and raving, dumping his crap all over the place ... Could you prove it, Edgar?
So, does Tricky Dick know about this?
Mein Kampf?
Personally I'd prefer a greyhound with a shot of speed.
I know for a fact that the one with the big tits is a Republican, and she'd do anything for the Party.
Hell, Kennedy's pissed Cuba away to the Russians.  And he don't know what the hell he's doing in Vietnam.  These are dangerous times, Dick, especially for business ...
Only if Kennedy dumps Johnson.
Desi's got a point.  What the hell are we gonna do about the Communists right here in our backyard?!
... And now I have a federal judge ordering me to bus my kids halfway 'cross town to go to school with some nigger kids. I think, Mr. President, you're forgetting who put you where you are.
That's triangular diplomacy, gentlemen.
Can you imagine what this man would have been had he ever been loved?
But your writings have changed the world, Mr. Chairman.
I must say you look very good, Mr. Chairman.
Yes, well ... Gentlemen, I promised my wife.  I'm out of politics.
It was illegal, what he did.
How many?
This isn't '48, Dick.  They'll never buy it.
But it was all we had.
Hi, I'm Dick Nixon.
What you have to understand, Mr. Nixon, is that we are willing to die for what we believe in.
We gotta make 'em think we're just as tough as they are -- that Nixon's a mad bomber, he might do anything!  I played a lot of poker in World War II , and I won big, and let me tell you this -- unpredictability is our best asset.  That redneck Johnson left me with a shitty hand and I'm bluffing.  I've got to play the hawk in Vietnam and the dove in China. And if we keep our heads, we can win this thing.
Mr. President, the press guys asked if you could come back for a minute.
What's in there?
Proud?
Or we could write "expletive deleted."
We lost ...
It makes us human ...
It is.  We know that.  And it's enough that we know.  Just think of the girls.  They're still young.  We never see them.  I lost my parents.  I don't want them to lose theirs; I don't want them to grow up without a mother and father ...
You're not a failure, Dick.
Amen to that.
My God -- divorce?  What about the girls?
It would ruin us, Buddy, our family.
Everything's political, for Christ's sake!  I'm political.  And you're political, too!
Dick, don't...
I'll do it.  No more.
You don't have to go.
It was our dream, too, Buddy, together ... always.
Yes ... you know it!  Yes ... I will. Yeah!
Anything.
I do.  I do.  In my own way.
No, it isn't.  I won't interfere with you anymore.  I'm finished trying.
You don't expect me to believe that for one minute, do you?  Does it matter what's on them? Really? ... Murder, Dick?  Sex?  Your secrets, your fantasies?  Or just me and you and ...
It'll be over soon.
Oh, Happy!  Dick Nixon ... You remember him.
What?
Some say you are, Rocky.
But -- how'd you know it was mine?
How fresh is this coffee?
What would you a done if he'd been released?
I'm kindly surprised to hear you say that.
No money in his room there?
Well, I don't know. He don't need any trouble from you.
Who's he in trouble with then?
Llewelyn can take care of hisself.
Yes ma'am?
You wouldn't think a car would burn like that.
Yessir, his vehicle. Man killed Lamar's deputy, took his car, killed someone on the highway, swapped for his car, and now here it is and he's swapped again for god knows what.
I know this truck. Belongs to a feller named Moss.
Are you telling me he shot this boy in the head and then went fishin' around in there with a pocket knife?
I'm goin' to try and keep from it as much as I can.
What do you think.
I mean, would you care to join me.
...How'd you sleep?
I put it in, Mama.
Not like that. Not like you say.
Did you buy that gun?
Odessa.
Not we, you. Stay with your mother.
What should I do?
Llewelyn, I ain't gonna leave you in the lurch.
What's that.
Hello?
...Where's the transponder?
...You getting anything on this?
...You need to talk to me.
You're in the hospital across the river. But that's not where I'm going. Do you know where I'm going?
You know how this is going to turn out, don't you?
How much?
What way would that be?
Didn't mean nothin'.
Now. We close now.
...What's the most you've ever lost on a coin toss?
Don't put it in your pocket. It's your lucky quarter.
You on all night?
I want you to take me to another motel.
November the 28th, last year.
Well enough.
...I'm wondering...
...An attempt at humor, I suppose.
...You pick the option with the applicable rate.
Could I get another room.
No, I want to keep my room, and get another one.
Lookin' for what's comin'.
...Don't worry. I'm not the man that's after you.
It's called a transponder.
What did you do?
So was I.
Look. You need to give me the money. I've got no other reason to protect you.
Why would he go to Odessa?
The heroin. You don't have it.
What outfit.
Ahh, what'd you do now... fall off your bike again?
It wasn't a woman.
Junior year!
So? ...Suppose Betty found out about them?
A woman can write a check.
What if the killers didn't see her? You published her picture -- you're gonna get her killed!
That's bullshit, Sheriff! You think she's a suspect!
What the hell do you want?... Hey, Sue Ann, what's up?
I just got something off the wire. The woman who owns it was murdered last night.  Now, I'm not saying I agree with you or nothing, but... what else do you know?
That's a lie! I figured it out! I've been trying to tell this dumbass --
You must be joking.
Oh, yeah, he's got things up and running, alright...
You really... didn't have anything to do with what Del was doing, did you?
...well, if you're not going to slit my throat, why'd you come up here?
Wait, Betty... you still haven't answered me.
Betty, I don't wanna shrivel up alone in some stinking prison. No way. I've got some professional pride. And I don't want anybody else to get the credit for taking me out.
I'll give you a hint. If you scrunch up your eyes a bit it looks just like a Jaguar...
The LeSabre!
Sorry, hon. Happy Birthday...
Let me know if you need anything, okay?
Betty, honey, listen to me. A man came by from Mutual Life Insurance. He says you've got money comin' to you from Del's policy.  Del's life insurance policy -- Are you with me?
Tell Del I'm sorry. I left so quick, but I need to do this.
I beg your pardon?
I tried to tell myself it was for the best, that there was a reason behind it. But... Del?
For Mother's Day, I used all my allowance that I'd been saving to take my mother to Kansas City. We got our nails done and had lunch at "Skies," a restaurant at the top of a building from where you can see the whole city. It was the last outing we took together. She died the following year.
Yeah, I felt that way, too, when I first started, but now... the hours, the repetition... it's not all glamour and mall openings anymore. Maybe I should've listened to my people and tried to make the crossover to nights earlier, I don't know...  ...I just hope it's not too late for me. God! Listen to me, "Me, me, me." It's so easy to get caught up in the whole ego cycle of this business and make it all about yourself. Stop, right? That's it, no more about me tonight, I promise... Let's talk about you... what do you think about me? I'm kidding... Seriously, Betty, I'm doing all the talking here...
But I'm David... I mean, I'm not David, but she thinks I am! You heard her...  Stop staring at me... I'm not crazy, she is!
I have... did it sound that bad?
I don't need one, but it's kind of a special night, and --
I took the blue Corsica, Del. Relax.
Hi, Betty. You're looking good...
What're you doing here, Roy?
Yes.
What's the matter here?
So you're into "Reason," too? Finally, someone civilized! I'm Ellen, what can I get you?
I can't believe I remembered that, although I suppose I should. I wrote it...  But that was seven years ago, and you're quoting it verbatim. I'm flattered... I think. Or frightened. What's your name?
Well, David moved out here and started his residency. Then he met Leslie --
What are you doing?
Hmmm. Sounds like you've had a pretty tough go of it with men...
Guess who I saw today.
I spent my weekend looking for someone who does -- not -- exist. I should have been here at the hospital with my brother, but I was with you.
Were you with him this whole time?
No, I'm not sure I could begin to imagine... So, where'd you go?
Was it a huge place? With a view of the whole world?
This isn't fair, you know. Do you always get what you want?
You should have a little faith in people.
...this is your sweater, right?
Yeah, but your running away isn't going to help you with all this...
These guys are here to help you, Betty.
He goin' crazy on us, or what?
All right gentlemen, let's get down to it. I need to know if you're for real.
You're not a dumb fuck, are you, Del?
You did not just say "Injuns," Del.
Like what?
Oh, Jesus, please... Please, God.
No, that's ignorant. They just don't know any better.
Del's dead, by the way. I sent him to the Great Beyond.
So she gets rid of the asshole and is set for life in the same day.
No, I see Betty as a Midwestern Stoic type. Ice water in her veins. A clear thinker. Probably a Swede or a Finn.
Thas' it, thas' it... conquer that bitch.  What time're they coming?
Let's get out of here. We got another long drive ahead of us.  ...the fuck where I do not know, but I know it's gonna be long.
Do I deserve this? In the twilight of my career, do I deserve this? I don't think so! I've always tried to do what's right. I never took out anybody who didn't have it coming. I'm a professional!  AND WHERE THE FUCK AM I? I'M IN PURGATORY!
I said 'got it?'
Hmm... you two in high school together?
Funny, that's just what I was thinking...
I'll tell the cast ahead of time. What do you say?
Hmm?
All right, everybody! That's ten minutes!
Jesus, don't do that! If it gets around that you fired me, I'll never land a pilot.
...what kinda car's Jasmine drive?
Damn, that's sweet...  She really that good-looking in person?
Because it ain't natural, young man.
No... before that.
What do you think my father would do if I told him I didn't want to be a lawyer anymore?
SHUT UP! Shut the fuck up, both of you, before I kill you!
Mrs. Rogers? I'm Dwight Campbell, with Neighborly Life Insurance. I'm looking for Betty Sizemore.
Huh?
Thankee boys for throwin' in that fricasee. I'm a man a large appetite and even with lunch under my belt I was feeling a mite peckish.
...Pete?
We didn't abandon you, Pete, we just thought you was a toad.
I'm sorry we got you into this, Tommy.
How'd he know about the treasure?
...but try getting a decent hair jelly.
...I'm not sure that's Pete.
It's Tommy! They got Tommy!
I'm just makin' a point, you stupid sonofabitch!
Y'ignorant slope-shouldered sack a guts!  Why we'd look like a buncha satchel-ass Johnnie-Come-Latelies braggin' on our own midget! Don't matter how stumpy! And that's the goddamn problem right there - people think this Stokes got fresh ideas, he's oh coorant and we the past.
I'm sayin' we har this man away.
Finest governor we've ever had in M'sippi.
No, I believe he's a-gonna paddle it.
Helluva idea.
Have him join us, run our campaign 'stead a that pencil-neck's.
...Time for this old boy to enjoy some repose.
That's not my ring.
I said I thought it was in the rolltop desk.
Well, I'm sorry honey -
Well now honey, that ring is at the bottom of a pretty durned big lake.
Yes, but honey -
I counted to three, honey.
Huh?! They dam that river on the 21st.  Today's the 17th!
How's this a plan? How're we gonna get a car?
Well, I'll be a sonofabitch. Delmar's been saved!
A million dollars.
The hell it ain't square one! Ain't no one gonna pick up three filthy unshaved hitchhikers, and one of 'em a know-it-all that can't keep his trap shut!
It was a moment a weakness!
They lured me out for a bathe, then they dunked me'n trussed me up like a hog and turned me in for the bounty.
Pete, uh, I don't want ya to beat yourself up about this thing...
We prayed to God and he pitied us!
Now what can I do you for, Mister French?
It's bona fide!
How was the flight? They take care of you okay? Long way from Norfolk, isn't it?
Come back here, kid!
Okay, okay. You win.
Hey, honey, look at this! My son! Isn't he beautiful?  You should've called!
I thought you quit school. Last I heard you were on your way to a construction job or something down in Brazil.
Ay, palequero. Never hochi in the P.I.
Who's that?
Who?  Aw shit, Zackie, let's not get off on your mother again, please.
Hey, baby, you could get sent to war, get your ass shot down.
Good morning, girls.
He doesn't mean anything by it, Zack. Do you, Joe?
Stop eyeballing me, mister! I've looked through your file and done a little checking, and I know it all. I know about your mother. I know your old man's an alcoholic and a whore chaser.  Life sure has dealt you some shitty cards! Hasn't it, Mayo?
I thought the D.I.'s were supposed to help you in this place! What kind of human being are you?
You're good.
I know.
What did you call me?
What did you call me, boy?
Only two things come out of Oklahoma, steers and queers. Which one are you, boy? I don't see any horns so you must be a queer.
Stop eyeballing me, boy! You are not worthy enough to look your superiors in the eye. Use your peripheral vision! Understand?!
I don't know what it is. It could be anything.
Is this you boys first night of liberty since you got here?
Exactly how late are you, Lynette?
But... but what would we do? Where would we go?
See you in a month when you get liberty!
Well, it you're not gonna ask, then I will. How was it?
How did it go with you guys?
He ask you out for next weekend?
You serious about having him over?
God! I've never seen anything like that in my whole life! Did you see that guy's nose?
And you turned him down??
You got a girl?
I hear most of the girls who come to these things are looking for a husband.
Yeah? Why're you here?
Just think 'I'm gonna do it!' Program yourself. See yourself making it. It'll happen. I know 'cause I just read this article in Cosmo, and it was about that very thing.
My old lady swallowed a bottle of pills one day while I was at school.
I'm sorry. I can't sit with you.
I'm so embarrassed. I knew I shouldn't have brought you here.
Some day. When I'm sure I can do a better job of it than my folks.
For a start, I wouldn't marry a man I wasn't in love with.
Your real father was an Officer candidate like me?
I'm looking for Sid.
Paula, he DORed and nobody's seen him.
Hey! You know goddamn well what happened so let's not play any games, okay?
Please stop it. None of that's true. Goddamnit, I love you. I loved you ever since I met you.
Yeah. You got the whole story just right.
I see you didn't DOR, Mayo.
Hey, do you guys ever... feel like you don't belong here...?
How about that prick! He told me he wasn't officer material because he grew up poor like me.
That isn't true, is it?
I kid you not, Mayo, I am in love. We must've set a new indoor record today. You want to know how many times we did it?
I don't believe that. They're just having a good time, same as us.
So what's the problem? Girls do that all the time.
Sid, what happened?
Please, Zack -- go back to the barracks!
What?
Stop it!  Stop it!
Me.  I am.
She's fuckin' crazy, she killed the kid!  She just killed her own kid!
Let me fucking finish this so we can get out of here.
-- posed to mean?
NOT THAT ONE?!
Got her right where you want her, Junior.
She said she did.
What do you want?
One day you will learn to respect other people's time, Lydia, one day you --
That's highly inappropriate.
-- seventeen feet wide, fifty-five feet deep, forty-two hundred square feet, four floors with a rentable basement apartment, so five altogether, courtyard in back --
None, there's nothing else, you know how tight the market is.
Too many stairs.
What?!
What do we do?
What if they get in here?
Why did the chicken cross the road?
Strip 'em, expose the ends, try blue first, blue is phones!
He'll do something.
He's just across the park, this is why we got places so close to each other, in case we needed each other, we're still a family, he'll help us...
Why?
Okay, you just gotta calm yourself down, that's all, just stay calm and your adrenaline will go back to normal and you'll be fine.
Little Bobby... Just a kid...
What? We're the leadership, you and me. There ain't enough of us to...
Spontaneous my ass!! You told the press and you don't tell me. Remember you're working for us.
I can't... they don't operate that way...
Yeah... I'm fucked up. You're fucked up. Government's fucked up. Whole country's fucked up. You got no idea what's going on here. This is bigger than you and me. We're just little tiny soldiers getting moved around on some big asshole's desk. The Panthers... fuck you're history... they killed you and you don't even know it.
Hey, this what they got you doing now?
Man, did you see Huey down on Grove street? All up on that cop, that was beautiful.
You got it. Berkeley?
Heh, bunch of shines running around in dark caps waving their fists about some streetlight. They're loud, but they aren't dangerous,
You want me to put a man on it?
Now hold on Rodgers...
Rodgers... this is no good...
Trust me Huey, this picture will be worth a thousand words. Now have you given any thought to that Peace and Freedom Party thing. They really want to hook up with us. Do a rally together. Hell it'd broaden our base of visibility.
...at least that takes Bobby Seale off the street...
Granted, the Free Huey thing has become a bit of a rallying cry for the left...
Shit, nothing but Paper Panthers.
We'll get them. Right now we got to worry about being armed and ready to protect Betty Shabazz. Those phonies sure as hell can't. We need guns.
Tell that to the pigs. Better yet tell that to Malcolm.
Judge... we're doing security for Betty Shabazz's visit next week. I'd like to have someone who knows there way around a pistol there. Someone like you.
Hey, GI bill pays for school. And shit, if I stuck around here, instead of signing up, I'd probably be in jail, or sitting on the stoop drinking Bitter Dog with Rose, you know?
The pigs are gonna start flooding us with dope. Huey wants us to stop them.
Unh... Unh Man... I don't take no money from friends that need help. Fuck no. What do you think I am a bum?
Judge... I... I shoulda told you this before but... well... fuck...
Ain't no one seen him.
Rose?
Motherfuck... well then I got something to do.
You meet those friends of yours in jail too?
If I'd known you were going to look like this, I never would have put ink in your tea.
Next time we'll bring more blankets.
Am I one of that sort?
Well?
You got salt last week.
They're from good stock on their mother's side.
I should have known... once I would have... I used to be wary... and today I watched my son killed before my eyes... your sister civilized me and I damn myself for having let her...
I know that.
We did.
First, you have in your possession certain belongings of mine, including clothing, private papers, furniture and personal effects of a non-military nature which I would like to have returned to me.
And if I triumph, you triumph.
How can we end this madness?
How old are you?
These four wagons must be his.
Lord Cornwallis is brilliant.  His weakness is that he knows it.
You learned her lessons better than I.
It was a different time, son.  And you're a better man than that.
Mister Robinson, I fought with Captain Marion in the French and Indian War, including the Wilderness Campaign.  We served as scouts under Washington and I have no doubts about Captain Marion's courage or competence on a battlefield. There's not a man in this room, or anywhere, for that matter, to whom I would more willingly trust my life.
... time, royal succession, regicide, bribery...
And your principles?
Where is he now?
Not me, you.  I'm going north with every Continental regular I can find to reinforce Washington or he won't last six weeks.
They'd be better off, but the cause wouldn't be.
Goodbye, Francis.
And congratulations on the birth of your son.
Your son, what did you name him?
You may, of course, keep your weapons, but I must warn you that...
Father?
Father, you can't let them take him...
Yes, but the rope might be--
Yes.
And that someone cared enough about that animal to mark the spot.
Because you promised.
Ellie--
How can you call it a good thing? A graveyard for pets killed in the road! Built and maintained by broken- hearted children!
Was it Pascow?
Hey--they actually found the place!
I can hardly read these.
No--not right out loud. Their stones speak...or their markers. Even if the marker ain't nothing but a tin can someone wrote on with a Magic Marker, it speaks. Ain't that so, Louis?
No need to apologize.
No, you shouldn't have stopped. But you got away with it. Important thing is are you sure you're all right?
Micmacs used to call it Little God Swamp.
This was their burying ground, Louis.
Doesn't look like they last long.
A man doesn't always know why he does things, Louis. I think I did it because your daughter ain't ready for her favorite pet to die.
Rachel not feeling well?
Out of the mouths of babes, Louis.
Jud, I buried my son today and I'm very tired. I wonder if we could just--
Please, I want to wake up. Leave me alone. It's not my fault you died; you were as good as dead when they brought you in--
The door must not be opened. The barrier must not be crossed.
I'll tell you where the ground is sour--the ground in my heart is sour. Let me tell you something else, Vic-baby: Wrong is wrong.
Gage's gone!
It was that place. That creepy cemetery up in the woods. Whatever disease the kids in this town have got, I don't want Ellie to catch it.
That's enough of that kind of talk!
I'm sorry I couldn't go with you to Missy's funeral. And that I blew up when we went to that silly animal graveyard.
Not by me, it isn't. I know how badly I acted, how unfair I was. It's just that I..you know.
You better get going, hon.
What's in your head, boy?
No!  You gave your word!
You're setting me up for a double cross, you with the ship, and me with nothing more than your word!
No, I really think I do.
Just so you know, Jack -- I don't think you're that clever.  I think you're a fool.  A mortal fool.
That's proper, sir, according to the code.
And how does a maid come to own a trinket such as that?  A family heirloom, perhaps?
No, no, nothing like that.  Very well.  You hand that over, we'll put your town to our rudder and ne'er return.
Do you not know what this is, then?
Elizabeth, I'm relieved you're safe.  Clap him in irons.  And behind his back this time.
No.  The pirates have taken Will --
I knew it.
I know the code.
I could never forget it, Miss Swann.
Why would my father send this to me?
What?  What's wrong?  How will this help us get off the island?
You should look at our contretemps this way: we've got shade trees, thank the Lord.  We've got some food on the trees, thank the Lord again.  And we've got rum, praise the Lord.  We can stay alive a month, maybe more.  Keep a weather eye open for passing ships, and our chances are fair.
That was before I met one, of course.
When I get the Black Pearl back, I'm going to teach it to the whole crew, and we'll sing it all the time!
To freedom.
Make it last, then.  Now, what's the nature of this venture of yours?
Jack, it's a fool's errand: You've heard the tales they tell about the Pearl.
I'll tell lee.  Now, Jack Sparrow has an honest streak in him, and that's where the whole problem starts.  This was when he was Captain of the Black Pearl --
It's a signal.  If we resist, it won't just be death.  There'll be torture as well.
Raise the sails.
Some sort of to-do up at the fort, eh?  You two weren't invited?
What's your name?
Where does it make berth?
The ship's real enough.  So its anchorage must be a real place. Where is it?
Never.  They took Miss Swann.
Why are brothering with that?
I swear, you look just like him.
Just do it quickly.
Wait -- what about the pistol?
Miss Swann!  We're here to rescue you!  It's going badly!
Go to the opposite end of the island, and signal the ship.  I'll keep 'em busy.
Will -- don't do anything stupid! Don't say anything stupid --
You haven't seen it.
No.
Oh, and no ship that's not crewed by the damned and captained by a man so evil that hell itself spat him back out could possibly have black sails and therefore couldn't possibly be any ship other than the Black Pearl.  Is that what you're saying?
That Jack Sparrow ... he talked about the Black Pearl.
Commodore --
Mr. Sim, when you do locate him.  Do not scare him off again.  Just watch him.  I think you can handle that. Right, Mr. Sim?
Dr. Bright, I don't have to do anything.
I brought you up here, Dr. Bright, because I want you to understand that we are on the path.  The only difference is that you are walking with your head down, afraid to look up, to see where the path is going.
As you can see I am a new man, just like you.
You can't do this!  You owe me, O'Brien.  I made you plastic!  I made you!
Like rotting meat.
She says it's not.
It works, Poppy.  It works, it works!
But, Poppy, you don't know what this means --
Yes, that's true.  We have to find him, run tests, determine if the polymerization is stable.
Gently, Ott.  Gently.
Look at me, Icarus!  Look at my body.  I've done everything, changed anything you asked me to.  'We will always love most that which we create.'  Is that still true?
Consideration?
Can you feel it, Poppy?  The presence of the moment?  Can you feel the weight of its significance?
Poppy, please --
Okay.  Alright.  Okey-dokey.  Now, we need the nanobot.  The nanobot that initiated the reaction.  Once we have that we can stabilize the meltdown.  Simple really.  No problem.
Facts, Dr. Nebbleman.  Facts. You've been using cryogenics to control the waste from the mouse experiment, haven't you?
Where did he go?
Dr. Makeo is working on it now, sir. I estimate at least another six hours.
I just want to know what goes on in the mind of a litterbug.  What chemical is secreted by your smooth brain that tells you, 'It's okay, just chuck it'?
Yeah.  I knew him when I was still in school.
They also tried using viral R.N.A. as the bonding element.
Yeah, somebody broke in and stole the samples, one of those animal rights groups, right?  I remember now, they freed all the monkeys which caused that huge pileup on the Massachusetts Turnpike, right?
What did security say?
Well, you got another problem.
I bet he hasn't read a single report we've written on the waste problem.
Of course, sir.
Is that what Argon told you?
I think that either you're going to give them to him or he's going to make you give them to him.
Yes?
He's probably right, sir, the building is probably going to collapse under its own weight.
Daniel...
Really?  What have you been doing?
Oh no.  Not by a long shot.  I may look like the old Daniel O'Brien, but on the inside, nothing is the same.
I'm sorry I brought the whole thing up!  If you're gonna flip your wig --
You don't know?
But you've polymerized single-celled bacteria and the fruit flies, I know you have.
Oh God, please!  This can't be happening!  I can't be plastic!  A plastic man?!
Why?
Pills... you know how I feel about pills.
Why do we need it?
So right now there's little replicators spreading throughout Argon's lab?
Lungs sound fine.  You didn't have any pre-existing physical conditions, did you?  Allergies? Infections?
Oh yeah, real funny.  Yuk-yuk. Let's laugh at everything a man believes in.
What's that supposed to mean?
Do you have something to bring me down?
That's pretty good.
What's that?
Oh no.  They're trying to blame you for the accident.  That means they must not have been able to control the replicators.
Argon's private lab.
Daniel, just forget Argon.  Let's get out of here.  We'll find another way to stop the waste.
This is wonderfully accommodating of you all.  Now I won't have to come looking for you.
Mrs. Argon?  It's Sim.
I spoke to Dr. Argon this morning and he remains frustrated over the loss of the original nanobot.
What in the hell?
Goodbye, Miss Gallagher.
I'm sure you're quite willing to be decent about this.
May I use your telephone?
That's a good idea - telephone the police. The number is Spring 3100. Get a couple of cops over and we can have a rubber of bridge.
What do you want?
I don't know how to thank you. Mother'll be so grateful - she'll probably want to kiss you.
Really?
Oh, Mother!
Oh, Mother will give us the blue room. You haven't a red room, have you?  Well, bless her heart. Wouldn't that be nice! My, oh my - six rooms and two baths and a blue room. I guess she would let us have the right wing if we needed it, wouldn't she?
You wear them of course, silly.
I know that.
Anne, prepare yourself for the treat of your life. This is Gallagher.
You know, Stewart, you failed to mention that Miss Gallagher was a very beautiful young girl.
Yes. As a matter of fact, you failed to mention that Gallagher was a girl.
Is this true, Stewart? Did you really say it?
I'm talking about - I'm not going out.
I'll tell you what. Let's you and me sneak out all by ourselves—
Now wait, don't get excited, Anne. There's no reason for that. Perhaps the boys have had a little too much to drink. That's all right. I'm sorry. I'll go right down and throw them out. That's no reason for you to take this attitude. After all, I certainly have a right to invite a few of my friends to my house, haven't I?
—and if it's all the same to you, I'm moving out.
You should have known better than to write, Romeo. I found that out a long time ago.
You don't have anything to complain about, Mother. He was all right last night, wasn't he? I told you not to worry about him.
Ah-ah-ah!
What's the matter? Isn't there a 'bless you' in the crowd?
Fine newspaper the Tribune.
Yeah. The boss sent me over to offer you a job. He wants you to write a daily column on the Tribune.
It's all right. You can write your own ticket. A hundred and fifty bucks a week.
Well, Stew, that's all thrashed out. By golly, I'm surely glad to see that you're not really sore. You know our racket - after all, news is news.
Yeah.
Now listen boss, if you're going to kick about that expense account—
Not on my own beat, no.
I've heard of people being scooped on their own funerals, but this! Holy mackerel! Why, it's news when Anne Schuyler gets her fingernails manicured, but this! She gets married to one of our own reporters and the Tribune beat us to it!  Well! What do you guys want? Go on, get back to your desks. Go back to your work.  Now don't tell me you were drunk at the time and don't remember! Or is this one of Bingy's snow-storms?
Well, when are you quitting?
Is that so?
And live on your salary, I suppose?
What play?
Araby?
You're my what?
Thank you, thank you, thank you! I'll do that for you some time. That's very sweet. Say listen, what did you say your name was?
Dawson, huh? Was I very drunk last night?
Say, you are nice. You're all right. You'd make a good wife.
I was sent from the Post in place of our social editor.
That's a lovely dress.
The boss is getting hoarse.
Sure, sure. You've got a nose, Gallagher. You've got a nose. But there's different women, Gallagher. You know, like brewery horses and thoroughbreds.
How far have you gotten?
Who was that?
No.
Nice set of Conrads you have out there, Mrs. Schuyler. I was just glancing through this one.  What's Michael tearing the paper about?
Now don't be absurd, Smith—  May I come in?
Remember what I told you about that twentieth crack? All right, you've just made it. Before you go unconscious I want you to get this through your nut.
Yes.
I sort of invited him along to bend an elbow. You don't mind, do you?
Double-strength!
Dexter Grayson, you told me it was only ten thousand—and you didn't even get those letters from that Jezebel!
Nobody seems to want to do anything—  Why not ask me? Perhaps I can offer a suggestion. Do what about what?
Good morning, everybody—  Well, maybe it isn't a good morning, huh?  Anne, did you ever get the feeling that there was someone else in the room with you?
And you struck him right here in our house—?
Did you call, sir?
No, that's enough. I just wanted you to get the idea. Now you know. This house is haunted.
Can I ask you a question?
What?
No. I want to know.
It's okay. It's alright.
Wait.
I made you these for the trip. They're marshmallow rice squares.
Oh, hello Betty.
Where'd you get this?
Wait ...
What is that?
How was your day?
... And you always seemed so smart and everything. Like that report you did on "Our Town Hall." Gosh. I didn't know what I'd talk to you about.
So I know I haven't been steady with anybody, but I just don't want to rush it. You don't want to make a mistake with something that important.
Sure is pretty.
To be honest Mary Sue. I didn't think you'd want to come here until we'd been pinned for a little while.
Mary Sue--C'mon ...
"Changes."  And it's not just the fire or big stuff like that. It's little things.  Did you hear about Bill Miller?
Are you alright?  What is it?
You're not allowed to do this! I could arrest you for this.
YOU'RE OUT OF ORDER!
THIS BEHAVIOR WILL STOP AT ONCE.
It's not in ME.
What do you mean!?
And where's that?
Hear your Dad got a new car.
David, cut it out. Mark Davis is gonna like be here in five minutes.
Omigod, I don't be-lieeeeve this! He's gonna like beeeee here!
Can we do any better?
JENNIFER!
What do you mean?
They're happy like this.
David, let me tell you something. These people don't want to be geeks. They want to be "attractive." They've got a lot of potential, they just don't know any better.
Um ... They like wanna ask you a question ... I didn't know how to handle it. So ...
How come I'm still in black and white?
Are you sure?
Keeps going ...
Um ... You gotta turn off Main Street.
Yeah ... I guess.  I don't know.
You want some berries?
Salesman. What did Bud and Mary Sue name the cat they found in the gutter?
No. McIntire's. Remember:  "For the very best in men's attire, Head right down to McIntire's."
... See, every time I thought I'd found someone they'd turn out to disappoint me. They'd know the early episodes, but they wouldn't know the later ones ... They'd know all about Muffin but they wouldn't know about Bud ...
Where are you going ...
Hello there.
So even though I can't make any promises, well--I figured if you asked me real nice--I might just be willing to talk about it again.
What do you mean?
There aren't any cheeseburgers.
Well how do you know it won't go back to the way it was?
TV repair.
Yeah. TV busted?
Told you it was your lucky day. Bet you thought I was just a fan or something.
So uh ... Maybe we could uh ...
This is Barry.
Hello, Karen. I'm just working.
Well, I can't talk though --
Yes, I'll be there.
It's extension 215 if you want to try me back.
Hey, how are you? BARRY I'm fine, hi, how are you?
Well I don't want to do something like that.
I don't think I'm going to the party.
Please don't.
...please, I just don't want it....
I know.
-- do you think you'll ask her out?
I'm not gonna rag you. Why would I do this just to rag you?
Yeah I can't.
What's all this pudding?
Why's it here?
What about her? You didn't ask her out, you're such a pussy --
Oh My God, yeah, I know exactly where she is, why?
What? Tell me why you wanna know --
I'm horny, Jack, what about you?
Hi....what....what's up....?
I'm going to work.
I know but I....how much is it?
Yes I can't....I don't make enough money to be able to do that.
Should I call back and talk to your girlfriend?
Hello?
It was cool last night.
Are you telling me no?
...MOTHERFUCKER, NO....
Hi. Do you work at the mechanic?
There's a piano in the street.
Hi.
I was, yeah, I was thinking about going there for business --
Do you want to pick me up?
...really? That's nice...are you lying?
That's very nice. Thank you. Thank you for saying that.  You're friends with my sister?
That's nice. It's nice.  I've been looking around a lot lately at promotional giveaways, cross promotional work by some companies. Do you remember all that pudding?
....I'm sorry....I lost my thoughts, what I was saying....
-- the promotion says: buy any 10 Healthy Choice products and get 500 miles of airline travel or 1,000 for purchases made with a special coupon. So in the supermarket, you notice their products, first you notice they have a Teriyaki Chicken Dinner at $1.79 - that's a pretty good deal....but then I noticed they had soup at 89 cents a can.....and you start to do the math and you start to notice that it's a really amazing deal because I stumbled across the pudding at 25 cents a cup. Now the crucial thing is the bar codes on the label. That's those little bar codes, you know? The universal product codes?
You see?
No I didn't say that.
My friend Carlos is doing it who works with me. It's his. It's his pudding, he's doing it. It's not mine. He's crazy. I told him not to do it. He's the one who's insane. He only spent about one hundred dollars so far though --
This is Barry.
That was good.
Have a good trip.
Hello?
Well let's do something do you want to do something, can you meet me?
I just wanted to make sure.
Ok. So you were married for how long?
You got me out of my hotel room. You came and got me out of my room.
It's so nice.
Do you wanna have sex?
Yeah.
That's right you travel so much.
I forgot about that.
Yeah.
Ok.
....I'm not exactly sure what that means...
Ok...because of the time difference if you needed to call me early?
No.
I don't know.
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
I'm gonna call the police then, sir.
It's just for verification through the credit card company.
Who is this?
You better watch your mouth, cunt, you're gonna get hurt.
How you doin' Barry?
Mhm.
I know that. Maybe you know other doctors?
I don't have anyone to talk to things about and I understand it's confidential with a doctor - I'm embarrassed about that and I don't want my sisters to know?
Why you wearin' a suit?
Good morning, Barry....
It's not a piano. LANCE! LANCE! MAKE SURE THAT YOU CALL THAT GUY IN TOLEDO.
You talkin' to me about Ramada Inn?
....now: this pudding?
I need to talk to you for a second.
Yes.
HEY. You made a fucking sex call and now you're gonna pay. It's not a big thing -- just give us some money and then it's over -- we'll just walk down to the ATM and get your money out --
Yes. Sorry.
Ok.
I don't really remember that.
-- she didn't know what she was talking about --
That's it.
What's the problem?
We should be going --
I can't find that thing in my car, I can't find it so I'll just get it and give it to you later. So?
I think he's weird, but that's me.
Welcome to Charenton, Abbe du Maupas.
-- and the listless ones do the binding.
"One day, Fanchon's first client was a surgeon. He ran his fingers across her naked skin, pulling apart folds of flesh, inspecting each and every follicle..."
Then how can we know who is truly good, and who is evil?
Has he hurt you?
Charenton has changed; it's not safe for you here.
If you'd grant me a final favor, I'd like the chance to explain myself --
Free his mouth.
It's that Doctor fellow, isn't it? He's come to usurp your place here, hasn't he?
Fuck 'em! They're half-wits and pinheads. Let 'em die on the streets, as Nature intended.
I have a proposition.
Virgin birth -- ha! An entire religion, built on an oxymoron!
What on earth would that require?
OFF WITH YOUR CLOTHES!
Oh, I'm to be blamed now, am I?
For fuck's sake, Abbe! What am I to do? Police my readers as you police me? Suppose one of your precious wards had attempted to walk on water and drowned? Would you condemn the Bible? I think not!
It's no secret that you loved her.
I WANTED TO FUCK HER, THAT'S ALL!
Who's to say I did not?
Of course.
You're a man of Science; I'm a man of God. Charenton stands to profit from us both, I'm certain.
He's made a great success of our Little Theater; there's seldom an empty seat. Not to mention its therapeutic value.
It's essential to his recovery; a purgative for the toxins in his mind.
Have you tried bleeding him with leeches? The calming chair? Maybe you should flog him at the stake?
You're a sentimental man.
I have.
It was not inspired by circumstance.
You ought to be ashamed, Abbe. Exploiting those drooling, pathetic cretins for financial gain --
My, my. You have exceeded my expectations.
"As he loosened his manhood from beneath his robes, The Bishop muttered a Latin prayer. And then -- with a mighty thrust -- drove it into her very entrails --"
As for the author... shoot him.
Yes?
My darling, Eugenie, dainty morsel! Get on your back! Let's try it dorsal!
I'll plunder every lovely pore until you're week and cry "no more!"
It's the only frontier I have left, plumcake.
What have they done to you now?
My newest book begins at my right cuff, continues across my back, and completes itself at the base of my left shoe...
Surely you've seen a man naked.
The Abbe's sending me away. He fears for me here, what with the likes of you --
A tale more horrible than all the rest combined!
"By the time you read this, we'll be long gone; bound for England or points beyond..."
I assume you've come to plead for clemency on your husband's behalf.
If you're truly determined to step out of the shadow of your husband's celebrity --
Good God, Marquise --
Hm? Tell me. What other treats?
I'd prefer to have our brandy in the salon. There we can sit... side-by- side... before the fire.
So you ever gonna do a picture?
That's why he has the parties, he says it's like bringing the world to me.
Yeah, Orson's a real piece of work. But deep down, he's a good kid. Real deep down.
Listen, you come down and stay with us for a few days. Just tell the old man that--
When I met him I was just 20. And he was 55. I saw the gold ring and just grabbed on. And he was going to make me a star.
Who are you, sir?
In Hollywood the fiercest bulls are the most brutally killed.
I wonder. Do you have any idea what you have done?
Intimately. For every sin you have placed on my head I could give you a hundred others. I have been swimming in blood my entire life. But I retain a belief, perhaps you will think it old fashioned, undoubtedly you will, but I believe that private lives should not be public property.
There. That's right.
The Journal was pretty harsh to Roosevelt today.
I just want to understand--
The jigsaw puzzles and the, urn, career -- the man spending a fortune to make her a star -- only it's opera and not movies. And...
Thank you for your time
I pay you a good deal of money to be my eyes and ears in Hollywood, do I not? If you cannot provide this simple service you are of no use to me.
He lied to me
Now, Orson, you know I'm just dyin' to see your picture and I know it's gonna be boffo, but you're writing about a publisher, right?
You drink at 10 am, do you?
Nix, sweetie. You shelve it
I don't know what you expected with Joseph- fucking-Conrad for Chrissake. I mean this is Hollywood, pal.
What are movies about?
Not for me.
So, we've got to come up with our movie. Our biography.
We find the man and then we dissect him-
How about Howard Hughes? We could do Hughes
The great Spanish bullfighter
"In Xanadu did Kubla Khan a stately pleasure dome decree. . . "How big is it, all told? The estate?
Here you are, up with the birds for once, you vampire!
Oh Christ...
Now remember he's a public figure who sought out that publicity so legally he can't stop us from--
It's good, huh?
Who owns this town? Who runs every goddamn studio? The tribe, baby. These fuckers hear the word "Jew" and they start sweating. Like Ester Williams' pool they start sweating.
This is just the first shot. Maestro. Sooner or later she's gonna use the word. And all those boys know that there is only one thing this country hates more than the coloreds and that's the Jews.
Is that from one of the Gospels?
Oh God.
Monstro! Ran into Walter Winchell outside He wants to play Herod in the picture. Hiya, George.
May I help you?
Of course, of course. How can we be of service?
It came.
"Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud."
Pardon?
Now don't have a fit -- but I want you to think again about doing WAR OF THE WORLDS-
The magazines are one thing -- but Hedda! Why did we have to let her come?!
For Christ's sake, shut up--
How dare you talk to me like that! Do you think I'm like all the rest of those pirates?! Like Mayer and Warner? Is that what you think--?!
You're not still mad at me, I hope
Look, not a single scene shot in the studio! We've found natural locations for the whole story--
I told you! Where? Grauman's? El Capitan? Or did Radio City come crawling back?
It's just not low enough. This is the scene. We have to look up at these two man as pillars soaring to the sky. As towering virtues in combat--
You want to do the life of Jesus?
Let's go, Jake, wake up!
I don't run the joint. They just told me to bring you in.
He's an embarrassment because Frankie and the other guys are expectin' me to do something about it, and I'm lookin' very bad. I can't deliver a kid from my own neighborhood. Why's he make it so hard on himself? He comes to me, I can make it easier for him.
What who's been sayin'?
J.R., glad you could make it.
What's wrong?
Sure. What is it?
You want me to do what?
How do you know? You know her that good?
Huh?
With her? How?
He fights the toughest guys around that everybody else is afraid to fight...
You won and was robbed! You didn't do nothin' wrong.
Say what you're gonna say.
Sure, I'll keep an eye on her.
What? I just said hello. Since when I can't kiss my sister-in-law?
You're very smart, Joey, very smart. Nobody gives me a straight answer around here. You're givin' me these answers, but you still didn't answer my question. Did you fuck Vickie?
Yeah. At night.
I'll give you anything you want, Jake. I think you should come out for a few minutes -- give yourself a break.
Jake, this is your father's bedroom.
You said never to touch you before a fight.
You said I couldn't. You've been good for two weeks...
Joey's right. Janiro's up-and coming, he's good looking...
But, Jake, I was just...
You're not interested in him?
Then why'd you say that thing about Tony Janiro?
I went out.
Jake, no --
I didn't do anything wrong. I swear. I just had a few drinks.
I'll say anything you want me to say. I fuckled Salvy. I fucked Tommy. I fucked your brother. I fucked everybody! What do you want to hear? I sucked your brother's fuckin' cock!
Aw, c'mon. Don't say that.
What are you doing?
But they don't have a case against you.
Jake, be careful! What're you doing to the belt?!
Salvy, would I steer you wrong? Let's say that's the truck; it's full of cigarettes, right? Now, two o'clock this morning we move the truck from here to there,  take the cigarettes out, sell 'em, make some cash.
What do you want from my life, Salvy? He's my brother.
Tomorrow, at the gym. Don't forget.
Try to understand, Vickie. Jake's got a lotta aggravation. He's been a top contender too long.
Indo-China -- Jeff predicted it would go sky-high.
Bryce, the only man for this job is sitting right here in town.  Get me L. B. Jefferies.
Name me a better photographer.
It was in her favorite handbag -- And, Mr. Doyle, that can lead to only one conclusion.
You didn't see the killing, or the body? How do you know there was a murder?
It's too stupid and obvious a way to murder -- in full view of fifty windows -- and then sit over there --  -- smoking a cigar -- waiting for the police to pick him up.
His wife took a trip.
He has a six months lease, and has used up a little over five and a half months of it.  Quiet. Drinks, but not to drunkenness. Pays his bill promptly, with money earned as a consume jewelry salesman -- wholesale. Keeps to himself, and none of the neighbors got close to him, or his wife.
Feel a little foolish?
I can't do it even if he's gone.
You know, every day for three years I asked myself that same question?
Forget the story -- find the trunk. Mrs. Thorwald's in it!
Jewelry?
Tom, I've got something real big for you.
This is Wednesday.
I'll send you some comic books.
Hello.
Okay. Indo-China. Tuesday. We'll pick you up.
Hello.
Can you get me that ring back?
Readers' Digest, April, 1939.
Right now I'd even welcome trouble.
The insurance Company would be a lot happier if you slept in your bed, not the wheelchair.
Eyes bloodshot. Must have been staring out the window for hours.
What'll you do if one of them catches you?
He and his wife splitting up?
His personal effects. He's probably running away -- the coward.
Goodbye, Mr. Jefferies. I'll see you tomorrow.
I'm just going to get the name of their truck!
I wonder.
Miss Lonely Hearts just laid out something that looks like sodium trieckonal capsules.
What are you two talking about?
You know, Miss Fremont -- he might just have something there.
What's she trying to do? Why doesn't she turn him in?
What about the rest?
Not yet, Jeff.
I'll have him call the moment I hear from him.
Who's Thorwald?
How's your leg?
And your stomach?
It's opening night of the last depressing week of L. B. Jefferies in a cast.
Make the one you want.
Yes.
Don't laugh. -- I could do it!
I could see you looking handsome and successful in a dark blue flannel suit.
Oh? You can see my apartment all the way up on 63rd street?
Well, she picked the most prosperous looking one.
How can you tell that -- from here?
Why would a man leave his apartment three times, on a rainy night, with a suitcase? And come back three times?
Jeff -- if you could only see yourself.
Sitting around, looking out a window to kill time, is one thing -- but doing it the way you are --  -- with, with binoculars, and with wild opinions about every little movement you see -- is, is diseased!
What makes you think something's wrong with her?
Maybe she died.
That's where he's being clever. Acting nonchalant.
Okay, chief. What's my next assignment.
That alligator bag his wife had on the bedpost --
He had it hidden in the dresser! Well, at least it was in there. He took it out, went to the phone and called somebody long distance. -- His wife's jewelry was in the handbag. And something about it worried him. He was asking somebody advice over the phone.
Suppose he doesn't come back again?
But only her husband would know that.  And the jewelry! Women don't keep all their jewelry in a purse, all tangled, getting scratched and twisted up.
They do not! And they don't leave it behind them. A woman going anywhere but the hospital would always take makeup, perfume and jewelry.
I'd like to see your friend's face when we tell him. He doesn't sound like much of a detective.
You said I'd have to live out of one suitcase  I'll bet yours isn't this small?
Of course, they have the same chance. They can look at me like a bug under glass, if they want to.
Did Mr. Doyle think I stole this case.
For a minute, Doyle almost had me convinced I was wrong.
Get an ambulance.  Don't move. Try to lie still.
What's that?
We heard firing.  He get anybody? You alone?
Tell him why we moved here.
You can't protect me.
You thought I was Mom?
You awake?
Hey--I want to ask you something.
The kind we've been talking about. Can you answer me now?
Excuse us a minute?
Luck, Jim.  Don't forget.
Can't you answer?  What's the matter with you anyhow?
No!
Frank?  I'm frightened.
Is he there?
Do you know why you shot those puppies, John?  Is that what they call you or do you have a nickname?
What do you think's going to happen, you do things like that?
Where did you get the gun?
Excuse me--but--You know where I can find--I mean I don't remember his last name--
He has a knife.
Come out come out wherever you are!
Nobody talks to children!  They just tell them one thing and mean another.
What?
Isn't he schizoid?
Mom and Dad.  I used to be in my crib and I'd listen to them fight.
I don't want you for my father!
You promised to give it back.
I'm sorry.
Sit down and eat--you'll be late.
What happened, darling.  We were so worried.  I was going to take a sleeping pill, but I wouldn't till I knew you were home.
He's not saying that!  He's saying don't volunteer!
He called me chicken.
They think I'll make friends if we move.  Just move and everything'll be roses and sunshine.
Cut it out now.  I'm warning you.
"Life can be beautiful." Hey, I know where it was.
Where I saw you.  Everything going okay now?  You live around here?
Where's Dawson High School?
No--I was just--maybe--
I don't think you trust anybody, do you?
Sure.  Lots of times.
You can trust me, Judy.
Want to read any books?  Take your pick!  Isn't this the craziest?
Maybe he's scared of the dark.
You smell like baby powder.
Is he your friend?
Do you think your father means that?
Did you stop to talk to anyone, Judy?  Do you enjoy that?
Your mother will be down in a few minutes.
She's being called for.
You're too old for that kind of stuff, kiddo.  I thought you stopped doing that long ago.
So. This is the guy you been waiting for. Man of your dreams.
You better be here to be good to her, loverboy. 'Cause she's been good to you.
Read you're a man of some knowledge.
IS THIS NICK MASON!!??
I've been doing good, though.
Gabriel!
We sell children's toys --
Negative five?
No, not that, no...  I mean this, the whole thing. Start writing to a guy, guy in the bricks. Get a boyfriend like this. Tell me the truth.
All the guys I've ever been with... they never want to know me. Who I am on the inside. They just want to qet inside. When they do, they think that means they know who I am. That I trust them. That they know me. That there's nothing left to learn.  A guy like you, Nick -- six months before you can even touch my face. I figure a guy in that kind of bind, he's gonna hafta work to get to know me some other way.
Ashley, Jesus --
You need a COAT!
Baby, c'mon, all this stuff... I haven't gotten you anything --
Baby, I'm gonna go tell 'em not to disturb us for the rest of the year. I get back in that room, you better be wearing nothing but a candy cane.
When'd you decide to do it, Ash? After which of his letters, huh? The fortieth? The fiftieth? The first?!
Nick, please, it's me --
No, Nick, no --
Since when do some trucker pals start thinking big, anyway?
He working for them on this one?
Get your own room, Ashley.
So does it look a lot different?
They'll have guns.
Bullets or no bullets, he won't do it.
No.
I saved your life.
He did love you, you know. Nick. He did love you.
But I never said Rudy.
You... you don't know me --
Put him in the truck.
But you were saying you were...
I had better sex in prison.
Be more specific.
They won't recognize me.
Got something to say to me, Nick?
Across from blackjack, there's a security doorway. Keypad access.
I want a map of that security level. Every room, every guard, every thing.
Hey. They got a shitload of cookies.
Where the HELL did he go?
I'm bringing in this great showroom act next week; these three Russian girls, they look like Meryl Streep, they can juggle anything.
What about the Powwow Safe?
What the hell was that about --
What about the money?
Here's my present to you, truck drivers --
THERE ARE MONSTERS IN THE GELATIN!
Hell you haven't.
Three days, man.
Why you gotta. We were gonna give you a ride someplace, man. Now I just don't know.
So maybe after our week beneath the sheets, we'll head down to Motor City for New Year's. She says her roommate's skipping town for a few days, have the place to ourselves. Remember how her brother's a truck driver down there? I'm thinking he might be able to help get me some work.
GUARD! GUARD!
Millie here used to serve drinks to these gunrunning truckers, real big talkers, talking bout a real score one day. I was in the Mountain, man, what the hell, why not let her get friendly with 'em? Let her tell 'em an idea she had, 'bout writing guys in prison. Getting one who could show 'em a sure thing.
Hell, you never needed to convince Ashley you were me. Just the dumb fucking truckers. I figured I'd talked enough about the Tomahawk in the pen for you to get by --
That was my card, pop! My card! You hit for my card!
Switch seats with me.
Start talkin
That's what it looks like!
I told you I don't know anything about any fucking set up. I've only been on the force eight months, nobody tells me anything! I don't know anything! You can torture me if you want -
That I should've picked you up?
Jesus Christ, give me a fuckin' chance to breathe. I got a few questions of my own, ya know.
Daddy, did ya see that?
Nuts. We got a big meeting in Vegas coming up. And we're kinda just gettin ready for that right now.
What does it matter who stays with the cop? We ain't lettin' him go. Not after he's seen everybody. You should've never took him outta your trunk in the first place.
I was in the sixth grade when that show was on. I totally dug it. What the fuck was the name of the chick who played Christie Love?
No, it wasn't Pam Grier, Pam Grier was the other one. Pam Grier made the movies. Christie Love was like a Pam Grier TV show, without Pam Grier.
Say "hello" to a motherfucker who's inside. Cabot's doing a job and take a big fat guess who he wants on the team?
What?
Myself and Mr. Pink?
I'm sorry.
Ain't that a sad truth. Remy Martin?
Who's your parole officer?
How is he?
I just want you to know, Joe, how much I appreciate your care packages on the inside.
I just wanted you to know, they meant a lot.
Toby... who the fuck is Toby? Toby... Toby... think... think... think...
Wong?
Nobody's trading with anybody! Look, this ain't a goddamn fuckin' city counsel meeting! Listen up Mr. Pink. We got two ways here, my way or the highway. And you can go down either of 'em. So what's it gonna be, Mr. Pink?
You gonna put it away?
Joe, I don't know what you think you know, but you're wrong.
Larry, I'm gonna kill him.
Okay ramblers, let's get to rambling. Wait a minute, who didn't throw in?
Mr. Pink?  Why?
He don't believe in it?  You don't believe in it?
What the fuck are they waiting for? That motherfucker cut off my ear! He slashed my face! I'm deformed!
Fuck 'em, they set off the alarm, they deserve what they got.
Why?
I told 'em not to touch the alarm. They touched it. I blew 'em full of holes. If they hadn't done what I told 'em not it, they'd still be alive.
I'd go over twelve percent for that.
Do you know what this is? It's the world's smallest violin, playing just for the waitresses.
Waitressing is the number one occupation for female non-college graduates in this country. It's the one job basically any woman can get, and make a living on. The reason is because of tips.
How the fuck do you think? The cops shot him.
Look, enough of this "Mr White" shit -
I think he's a sick fuckin' maniac! We're awful goddamn lucky he didn't tag us, when he shot up the place. I came this fucking close -  to taking his ass out myself. Everybody panics. When things get tense, everybody panics. Everybody. I don't care what your name is, you can't help it. It's human nature. But ya panic on the inside. Ya panic in your head. Ya give yourself a couple a seconds of panic, then you get a grip and deal with the situation. What you don't do, is shoot up the place and kill everybody.
So, is he dead or what?
So what is it?
You didn't tell him your name, did ya?
We had just gotten away from the cops. He just got shot. It was my fuckin' fault he got shot. He's a fuckin' bloody mess - he's screaming. I swear to god, I thought we was gonna die right then and there. I'm tryin' to comfort him, telling him not to worry, he's gonna be okay, I'm gonna take care of him. And he asked me what my name was. I mean, the man was dyin' in my arms. What the fuck was I supposed to tell him, "Sorry, I can't give out that information, it's against the rules. I don't trust you enough."? Maybe I shoulda, but I couldn't.
Don't fuckin' patronize me.
And I'm very sad about that. But some fellas are lucky, and some ain't.
Then. That time has passed. Right now, Mr. Blonde is the only one I completely trust. He's too fuckin' homicidal to be workin' with the cops.
I told ya he'd be pissed.
He seems all right now, but he went crazy in the store.
Okay, Mr. Expert. If this is such a truism, how come every nigger I know treats his woman like a piece of shit?
And that's more important than finding Lednov?
Who shot who?
It doesn't matter who they are.
You can't leave us here.
We have to get to Sonora. There are jobs waiting for us there. We'll pay you for your trouble.
Where do you keep the can opener?
There's a nice boy.
You don't have to explain. Did I tell you how grateful I am for what you've done?
I hope you get everything you want out of life --
You've earned it -- the horse ranch on the Toulomoe -- the girl in the spotted gingham.
Ever since you've looked after Steve you've had the dream -- a ranch on the river -- good grass, good water, barn corral and house --- that part you've shared with Steve. The girl in gingham you plan sneakin' in when he isn't looking. 
He knows his alphabet.
Don't you trust me?
Why did you change your mind about bringing us along?
No, I'm not all right. I'm soaked and I hit myself against that rock.
Drop yours. I'm gunshy.
I -- lost something.
Stretch out under the seat, Miss.
How does she draw?
Like why you're buyin' a whole slew of 30 30 shells all of a sudden.
In a fight?
They sure must have been travelin'. This keeps up we can start a store.
Okeh, I was wrong. But you can't expect a fellow who never saw Lednov and never heard his name until a while ago to do too much worryin'. You've been sorta close mouthed about him.
Sure I do. Went off down to Mexico or something...
Oh... that's the time you went away.
I didn't stop to think, Clay.
Come on. We got a couple hours to eat and get some sleep.
You oughta say you're sorry -- that's what you oughta do.
It is so your fault and... and I guess maybe when we hit the ranch... you andme better...
You can light the lamp.  I'm sure glad it's you. We were afraid those killers might come back.
You can't stay here. There's snakes and it's cold and you'll just get sicker.
It isn't that --
That something I shouldn't see?
What's the matter -- restless?
When I ask questions, I like to hear answers.
There you are. Now take it easy and you'll be all right.
We tried to point that out. But there were some pretty nosey citizens who wouldn't listen to reason. They said Aspen had outgrown us. It's all right to play poker in your own home but not in a saloon.
I tried my best, but these things take time.
You're not giving up?
Maybe I better start working on him.
We might as well start a fire.
You said somebody was comin' back -- who's comin' back?
Why, yes. They're all I need...
U-n-i-c-o-r-n-... What in heck's that?
Well, Steve?
Sometimes not knowin' how to read has its points. You can't read books so you look at people and figure 'em out.
She was only teasin'.
Oh, he was a widower. Why didn't you say that?...  Don't worry, sweetie, I can whip up a new batch in a flash.
Are you okay? I thought I heard screaming.
So, I see you're really into spooks.
Maybe we can study together or something.
But, hey, maybe we can be friends.
Whoa, check this out. She looks like you.
Well, if that's Hanson, then who's the guy with the hand?
Like, I've always wanted to walk on the moon.
What are we gonna do? I'm cold. I can't move, I'm so cold.
Feel that?
Better try a little higher.
Cindy, please! It's a matter of life and death. I'm asking you a friend.
I know, but I've been thinking --
Stop it! I'm just trying to say I think we should take our friendship to the next level.
Good-night, Cin. I'll be next door if you need me.
Okay, I get the point.
Let her go, Cin.
Oh, my God, Ray! What are you doing here?
Ray, you saved my life. Are you okay?
It was you...
Father!
Oh.
Aww, the little bird died.
She'd have to be really pretty and I'd have to be very drunk.
Are you?
Professor, what's the history of this house?
Alright, Cindy, what's so important?
I got it!
Good idea, and don't forget to give her a good-night kiss.
Oh, my God. It happened right here. She came home. She saw them.
Let me help you.
Car accident, gun shot, multiple stabbings, a hook through the back... Where did you find these kids?
Fantastic. These kids are exactly the kind of catalyst needed to awaken Hell House.
Professor!
Are those cameras all throughout the house?
So, if one of our little chickadees is taking a shower which one of these buttons do I press to get a close- up?
Professor, we need to talk.
What are you working on?
Excuse me, sir, but the students have started to arrive. Dinner will be ready shortly.
Father, are you okay?
Remember, don't ask her too many questions.
Yo son, check this out.
Sorry, y'all. My bad.
"Fucked me."
"Ray!"
"Ray!"
Hi, Mom.
Oh, boy! 
0h, shit!
Bring her home... I guess.
I wouldn't give ya a nickel.
Here we go again.
How about Mrs. Ackerman? We both hate her!  Should she be the next victim?
I'm Dr. Eugene Sutphin. What's the trouble, officer?
No comment!
Sorry, ma'am.
Chip, honey?
You kids. Now Birdie, I want you to have a cookie and then run along home.
Bye, Birdie.  Chip, honey... I know it's hard being a teenager but I understand... I'm your mother and I love you.
I'm sorry he's dead, but... have you signed off yet?
Home Sweet Home! Everything's fine, kids!
I can't stop thinking about that poor teacher.  Goodnight, honey. Don't read late, we've got a big day with the birds tomorrow.
It's fine with me, Beverly.  You want to, honey? You think the kids are asleep?
"P" as in...
What exactly does this sick individual say to you?
MOTHERFUCKER!!
So you weren't drunk when you received those alleged obscene phonecalls?
State your name, please.
Ooohhhhhh! I made it all up! I never saw Beverly Sutphin in my life!
Yummy. Carl says if I lose ten pounds, he'll take me to the University of Maryland Fall Mixer.
Damn these yellow-jackets! I hate 'em!
That's like your car, Beverly,
Did you find your Franklin Mint egg, Rosemary darling?
Mrs. Ackerman, when you left me at the flea-market, where did you go?
Did Carl Padgett buy something you wanted?
And those were your scissors found sticking out of Mrs. Sterner's stomach, weren't they?
Mrs. Ackerman, do you recycle?
Mrs... Sutphin?
Chip is off to a fine start this year.  Focused... conscientious... participates actively in classroom discussion.
What is it, Mr. Stubbins?
He is assistant manager of a video shop...
What was that?
What is it, Betty?
Young man, this Faberge Egg is chipped.
I'll give you fifty cents.
That girl was looking for Jacqueline Gibson. I'd forget it if I were you.
The name may not mean anything to you, young lady, but say the word and I'll have your sister for you in forty-eight hours.
You can't tell.
Let's get out of here.
We can't stand here all night.
Then, you also understand that you must die.
May I have some water? I'm thirsty.
I read your book. The one in which you wrote about the cure for drinking.
I've come from Jacqueline. She needs money.
You're a curious man. You're willing to jeopardize Jacqueline's life in order to satisfy your own curiosity.
I don't get this. Miss Jacqueline was always so fond of you -- she was always talking about you -— had your picture in her office.
Some of us, Frances, must believe without understanding.
But I'd give a great deal to know.
I'm sorry. I didn't intend to treat you like a child.
You've never believed a word I told you about Mr. August.
But I'm better than a detective. I have an understanding of people - and a love of them -- an understanding of the city - -
But I understand her. That may be more important.
Well?
All very nice but, what are you going to do - listen at every house in New York for Jacqueline's voice?
She'll have to know some time.
And you don't want to die. I've always wanted to die -- always.
I'm tired of being afraid -— of waiting.
I don't know.
At least you knew about Dr. Judd.
I have been at the library.
I thought it would be, but just to be sure, I'll tell you that the Palladists are a society of Devil worshippers --
My window - - through which I see the world.
You went to see Mrs. Redi... She told you something -- what was it?
Not I —- I am alive, yet every hope I had is dead,  Death can be good. Death can be happy.. If I were really dying I could speak like Cyrano -— "My courage like a white plume" — and all the other lovely words with which he greeted death. Then perhaps you might understand,
I think I understand without your telling me. I know something of your history, Jason. I know that you haven't written for ten years.
If you like, I'll go with you to dinner.
Life has betrayed us. We've found there is no heaven on earth, so we must worship evil for evil's own sake. We're not wicked. We commit no violence, unless...
I've talked nonsense. I've scoffed and hooted -- but somewhere very deep down in me, I always felt that good held the balance of power.
Your sister - - have you heard from her lately?
That makes it all the more difficult ——
I went back through the history last night. I read about Johann Rozenquartz -- I read what he wrote --
I have taken care of Mary. I've spoken to her. She's going back to school.
Oh, uh-huh.
Well...
You play an instrument?
...free-lance. You know.
You mean like "time flies"?
How long has it been since you've seen John?
Nine years?
Do I pay taxes? Of course I pay taxes, only a liar doesn't pay taxes, I'm not a liar. A liar is the second lowest form of human being.
Yeah, I know. I mean, I'm not saying I know people think you're a bitch, I'm saying I know what you mean. And I don't even know that people think you're a bitch. Do they?
Do you understand what I'm trying to say?
You're what?
Well... are you self-conscious about it?
Aren't you?
It's a personal project I'm working on.
Oh, just a personal project like anyone else's personal project. Mine's just a little more personal.
What about sex?
Like what?
This is just... so...
I'm not sure why I came here. I had kind of decided not to talk to you after... you know.
But even if we had been speaking, I wouldn't have told you.
How do you pay for all this? I mean, rent, and tapes and this equipment.
What will you do when the money runs out?
Yes.
That's correct.
Her name was Elizabeth.
The problem was me. I was... I was a pathological liar. Or am, I should say. Lying is like alcoholism, one is always "recovering".
I loved her for how good she made me feel, and I hated her for how good she made me feel. And at that time, I tended to express my feelings non- verbally. I couldn't handle anyone having that much control over my emotions.
Now I make sure that no one has the opportunity to test me.
Did you confront John with the fact that you knew about him?
If you do get out of your marriage, will you continue to be inhibited?
Interesting analogy.
No, you're not.
But if you were?
But I feel like maybe I could be really comfortable with you.
I've told you.
You mean you're still in contact with her?
But you're planning to be?
Because.
Why are you ashamed?
But why can't you just put it all behind you? Can't you just forget it? All that stuff you did?
Oh, we get along okay. She's just very... she's an extrovert. I think she's loud. She probably wouldn't agree. Definitely wouldn't agree.
John?
Then maybe I saw an old message. There are a lot of them on my desk, you know.
There's nothing to know, Ann.
Ann, you are completely paranoid. Not ten minutes ago I wanted to make love for the first time in weeks, and you act like I'm dipped in shit. You know, I think there are a lot of women that would be glad to have a young, straight male making a pretty good living beside them in bed with a hard on.
I was just saying, you know? I didn't get paranoid when you didn't want to make love. I could have easily assumed that you didn't want to because you were having an affair.
I'm not either!!
Loud.
Goddammit, goddammit!! That son of a bitch!!  Well, at least I know you didn't fuck him.
You're leaving me for him, aren't you? Well, that makes a sad sort of sense. He can't, and you won't.
Goddam right.
You son of a bitch!!
God damn you!!
No, I didn't.
Do you have any idea what triggered this concern?
What brought this on?
There are many things that can exert control over one's life, good and bad. Religion, greed, philanthropy, drugs.
What?
I say it because it's descriptive.
I think you're afraid to put the two of us in the same room together. I think you're afraid he'll be undeniably drawn to me.
"My type"? What is this bullshit? How would you know what "my type" is?
Because I never got around to it.
No, it's nothing like that.
Yes, I did.
What!?
You couldn't do it, period.
No. I don't think they all did what I did.
Here it is.
And are you here to berate me for making her that way?
She didn't give you my address?
I don't understand. Why did you want to come here? I mean, I can't imagine Ann painted a very flattering portrait of me.
Well, either you are or you aren't. Which is it?
Doing what?
And you ask questions, right?
Do I sit or stand?
I'd rather sit. Are you ready?
Describe for me your first sexual experience.
Were you disappointed?
What did he say?
Hello.
I'm sure a substantial number of men in this town would volunteer.
Ouch. Okay, I deserved that. Cynthia, don't you understand? After the first time it's just not spontaneous. There's no edge anymore. Look at the tapes, there is only one date on each label. I have never taped anyone twice.
I've got to get back to the office.
Who said I was jealous?
I'm intrigued.
How about inviting me over to dinner?
Hello.
Well, this is timely. Your wife is here, would you like to speak to her?
It's just so blatantly stupid, I have a hard time believing you did it.
Of course. She is my sister. I tell her almost everything.
That's right. But I never took a vow in front of God and everybody to be "faithful" to my sister.
No, he didn't put me up to this. Jesus, I don't need people to tell me what I should do. I've just been thinking about things, that's all.
I know. Will you please leave now?
Student?
I wish I didn't have to live someplace.
Get rid of the car when you get your apartment, then you'll still have one key.
God, you need help.
Have you ever wanted to make love to someone other than your husband?
Answer him, goddammit!!
Mr. Millaney?
...probably nothing at all. It's probably just a bunch of, I don't know, fatty cysts. You can have them removed in a doctor's office. Has Nick seen a doctor?
OK, then. I'm gonna go back to the store and buy my own pack and smoke 'em all myself.
Jesus!
And that was her. Annabelle Horse... field.
OK, Roger. Here's the stuff you wanted. Files on Horsefield, Tudor, Swinburne, and Velakofsky. Papers published by Hobbes, Linsky, and Lefebvre in a couple of issues of the Bulletin of the Canadian Medical Association and also the Journal of the American Medical Association. And, as an added extra, a couple of odds and ends from the files I helped compile before your time here, Doctor. I thought they might interest you.
Another kiss?
Roger? If you're going to be staying here anyway, why don't you come up to my place for a late supper?
Forsythe, Forsythe! What's wrong? What's happened?
Didn't seem worried about them.
Not exactly the kind of lunch Hobbes would have laid on you, Rog, but it's all I got, and...  ...all I got I share with you. Go ahead. Take all you want.
I'm still a VD man under the skin, Rog. You know me. I'm a down-to-earth kinda guy, right?
I know. You're bored already. Transplants are yesterday's kishkas, right?
You put the bug into the body of a man with a diseased kidney, the bug attacks the bad kidney, dissolves it, it's assimilated by the body, and now you got a perfectly good parasite where you used to have a rotten kidney. I know what you're gonna say. You're gonna say it's crazy.
You want to help sick people for the rest of your life? God forbid I should talk you out of it.
OK. It's apartment 1009, South Tower, Starliner Towers. May as well go there directly.
BREAKING OUT
Later, Brenda.  Ah, Bert, could you spare a moment?
When do I get to see Brad?
Why Janet?
Of course, Mrs. Majors -- Janet -- But I'm puzzled.  If she was so keen on getting him in here, why wouldn't she sign the contract?
Oh, Oliver, you're so tolerant. Time for a coffee before you rush off?
McKinley?...McKinley?
Sounds like my husband.  He never came back either.  At least not after Flavors gave him a commercial break.
Conspiracy is right.  The Denton Dossier is...
I bet that Macy Struthers had a hand in this.  We'll probably be replaced by an hour of fashion tips!
Overreact!  You're the one with theories about conspirac...  Oliver?
Clever of you to find this spot, Betty.
A 'stately pleasure home' indeed.
Look.  Look at that.  Bert Schnick can see.  Why...he's...dancing.
Care to indulge?
Oh, Oliver.  What are we going to do?
SOME PEOPLE DO IT TO BE FUNNY
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR EACH OTHER
YOU'LL FIND A RAMBLING ROSE AND A PICKET FENCE
What are you talking about? Danny Slepstrini is a chip off the old block.  I played 18 holes of golf with his father just last week.  And Hank says Danny's moved to New York.  To better himself.
Mr.  Flavors -- may I have a moment of your time?
It's only one night, Janet. Let's not forget who we're doing this for?
Poor Brad.
Oh, Mac ran up this little crowd-pleaser.
He will.  But it's up to you to reawaken his feelings.  You've got to be fabulous, look, think and appear fabulous.  And Farley's given you that chance.  You can use the Breakfast Show to knock Denton dead.
. . .For his own good.
Brad!
Let's hear the five 'F's' for today.  F for...
F for...
This is the nerve center of operations, Janet.  You must stay here tonight.  That way we can all be here when Mr. Sun paints us a new day with his golden brush.
I FEEL THE HEAT FROM YOUR SKIN AND THE STUBBLE ON YOUR CHIN YOU'RE NO GOOD
THAT MINIMAL
This could be worse than the old series.
And none of them worked?
You don't think I fuck you, bitch? I'll fuck you.
And you liked fucking him, didn't you, you fat little whore?
How's the trip?
Actually there is word. I spoke to Keith Kurtzman this morning.
And... they're passing. Conundrum's passing. He said they really liked it. They really wanted to do it, but they just couldn't figure out how to market it. He said it was a tough call.
My condolences.
Now there's a girl who knows how to pour. What's your name?
Tastes good to me. You live around here, Stephanie?
I can explain.
Anything I'd know?
Whatever you girls want. It's on us tonight. Sky's the limit.
I don't think so. We're celebrating Miles's book deal.
Where the fuck were you, man? I was dying in there. We were supposed to be a hundred miles away by now.
Come on. You're fucking hungover.
No, I didn't. What I said was that my agent had heard there was some interest at Conundrum...
Yeah.
How about the new ending? Did you like that?
What?
How old's she going to be?
That's your problem, Miles.
You know what? Let's take the Santa Rosa turnoff and hit Sanford first.
This is rose, right?
First take your glass and examine the wine against the light. You're looking at color and clarity.
Huh. Maybe a little strawberry. Yeah, strawberry. I'm not so sure about the cheese.
No way. This would just provide some stability is what I'm saying. I can always squeeze in an audition or a commercial here and there, you know, keep myself in the game in case something big comes along.
Yeah. Tight.
Here's to my last week of freedom.
Sure I know Maya.
So what's a professor's wife doing waitressing? Obviously that's over.
Perfect.
The girl is looking to party, and you tell her we're going to go back to our motel room and crash? Jesus, Miles!
The chick digs you. She lit up like a pinball machine when she heard your novel was getting published.
She has the best palate of any woman I've ever known. She could even differentiate Italian wines.
Jesus Christ, Miles. Get out!
She called Maya, who's not working tonight, so we're all going out.
Oh, hey, change of plans. Steph's off today, so she and I are going on a hike.
Right now.
What the fuck are you doing?
This is totally different. I'm talking about avoiding what you're talking about. That's the distinction. I have not made the commitment yet. I am not married. I have not said the words. In a few days, I might get married, and if I do, then I won't be doing stuff like this anymore. Otherwise, what's the whole point of getting married?
That's a public course.  No Stephanie?
You know, in life you gotta strike when the iron's hot.
Is an abattoir like a... like a... what is that?
You ever actually read any of this guy's books?
Yo! Yo! Here's my boy! Here's my boy! Who's your daddy, boy? Who is yo' daddy?
So tell me everything. Details. I like details.
You didn't get any, did you?  You're a homo.
You ever actually been in there, Miles?
Let me use your phone.
What about that guy who wrote Confederacy of Dunces? He committed suicide before he got published, and look how famous he is.
See? Right there. Just what you just said. That's beautiful. A thumbprint on a skyscraper. I couldn't write that.
No, I did not. Must have been Gary at the Hitching Post. I think we mentioned it to him the first night.
Good thing you have a voice-over career.
So how did Stephanie know it was Saturday? We didn't get into that with Gary.
What's it look like to you?
No. She ordered them special. Took her forever to find them. They've got this design on them with dolphins and our names engraved in Sanskrit. We've got to go back. Christine'll fucking crucify me.
Please, Miles, please.
Fuck you. I'll get it myself.
Come on, let me drive.
What the fuck!
Look at this!
Love you, man.
I'm doing good, good. You look great. Did you lose some weight?
This is good. Little hints of clove.
So what gems do you have in your collection?
Seriously, the '61s are peaking, aren't they? At least that's what I've read.
Wow. We gotta give it a moment, but this is tasty. Really good. How about you?
Is she sleeping or...?
It's kind of weird sitting here with you in Stephanie's house. All those times you came into the restaurant. It's like you're a real person now. Almost.
Yeah, weird. But great.
What's the title?
Oh. You mean... today?
Yeah? Like what?
Hey, Miles, I heard you came by the restaurant last night looking for me.
About two-thirty.
Were you ever going to say anything?
Maya.
You know, I just spent three years trying to extricate myself from a relationship that turned out to be full of deception. And I've been doing just fine.
Hello?
Well, I'm not coming, Barbie. So you guys have fun.
That's great.
Seems like everyone's getting married. A year ago it was all divorces. Now it's all weddings. Cyclical, I guess.
Oh. Huh. Well...  Congratulations again, Vicki. That's wonderful news.
How much skin and stem contact?
Pour me a full glass. I'll pay for it.
What's everyone ordering? Then we can sort out the wine.
Where's Jack?
Me? No, I think it's kind of a stupid game. I mean, at least, I could never get into it. I tried it once.
Hi, guys. We should probably get going.
See you, Miles. You take care.
You talked to Wendy?
It makes me feel better.
Not English though. You heard the voices right Uncle Merrill?
Hi sweetie.
...Tell Graham --
You do?
It doesn't sound natural when I curse.
It was very dark.
It's noise.
How can you say that?
For the kids protection. All they were doing was watching TV from five a.m. I felt like they were getting obsessed like you said. They should be playing furry, furry rabbit or tea party or something right?
That's a game isn't it?  Anyway...  There's been some interesting developments.
I'm sorry, what book is this?
He was only a year and half old.
We won't be able to get out of there.
Merrill --
Don't touch him.
Scientists who have been persecuted for their beliefs.
Dad.
They'll read our minds!
What about them?
Second thing this week I can't explain.
I don't know whether to look for a midget or a --
Let me ask you two something. Don't be embarrassed by the answer. It is possible... Just possible now, you might have been chasing each other around? You said you went in opposite directions.
I don't think so.
There was an accident. Drunk driving. They weren't sure.
Is that him?
Some guy had a sign that said it was the end of the world.  Nothing really bad is going to happen, is it Uncle Merrill?
You brought a posse to my best hideout and you want to know if I mind. Mister, I don't know any of those names and you're about to die.
If we charge them, they won't have a chance. But we gotta get to the horses.
No, no, no! I winged him, and he dropped his gun.
Where are we?
I'd be worse if you hadn't come along.
This was my father's. The men who killed him took it.
I gotta get to my brother. If they came after me, they'll want him too.
Weren't you going to come out to say good-bye?
This time you're really going?  You know where I'll be.
I've got my people sitting down there...  ...swatting flies and raring to go.
Looks like those boys are headed south, so they weren't the same ones that jumped me. Which way you going?
What's Turley like?
They got a saloon there?
You'll have to deal me out on that. I've had some experience with that sort of thing, and I don't want any more.
I think I'll ride along with the lady here. Just take a look at this farmland before I come into Silverado. See what makes a trip this hard worth taking.  I'll see you around.
All I'm saying is, you won't trip over me if you look her up.
I'll see you around.
What about the law?
Never will again.
Mr. and Mrs. Parker have agreed to join their parcel to mine. We'll work them together.  Mine starts right over there. It's all I've ever wanted. Pretty land, isn't it?
It was not -- it was Murdo's. Those McKendricks don't know how to act like human beings.
Came to the wrong town. I don't tolerate this kind of thing. It's hard on the peace, and it's hard on the furniture. Now, knowing a bit about Carter here, I'm going to let you go without paying for the damages. But go you will, and I mean now.
What's all this then?
We'll see about that. I'm Sheriff John Langston. As you may have guessed, I am not from these parts.
Tomorrow morning. Ten o'clock.
I'm not sure, but I got an idea. And when I am sure, they're going to pay.
What are you doing here, Rae? This ain't for you.
Rae, all we got is each other.
Why come to me?
Things are getting messy around here.  I hear Ezra Johnson got himself killed.
This is mighty sweet, Paden. I think I finally found my place in the world.
Nothing like that will happen between us.
I took out thirteen dollars.
I thought we talked about that.
My compliments to you, Miss Stella. This is what I call a saloon.
That's Kelly, my so-called partner. He runs that side.
What's this?
What makes you say that?
You sure? Maybe that's the kind of friend I am.
I've got a place I can hide her.
We all know what happened.  In a fit of jealous rage you killed Simone and dumped her body off a boat she bought for you.
My God, are you alright, Simone?
We have a daughter together.  I just don't want to see Viktor get hurt.
Christ --  Elaine, I know how it looks but...  ... it would mean a lot to Viktor if you'd go with him to the Oscars. If you won't do it for him, please do it for me.
-- Do you know what these are, Elaine?
I'm not taking away your daughter, just your deal.  You and I both know, after the divorce I kept you on for old time's sake, so you could still hold your head up in front of Lainey.  I called what's his name at Warner's.  He said he'd take a meeting -- in July.  I've fought for you Viktor...  You want to talk severance?
I can't wait to meet her.
Don't be ridiculous.  I arranged a press conference.
Viktor, it's my studio.
Sorry I didn't get her back in time.
Viktor, we simply have to talk about "Eternity..."
Really?  Oh, so she's really going to do all this nudity?
Hair and make-up?
Stunning, Viktor.  The Hollywood Foreign Press is going to eat this up.
Yes.  To be honest I never quite saw this film before -- maybe it's the way Simone is playing it -- but what it's saying about the illusion of permanence in everyday life, how that's the only way we can love -- I think it's really going to mean something.
Everyone I know has met her, Viktor.
She doesn't want pity.
She was there.  She didn't by any chance happen to mention me?
Are you and Simone...  ... getting married?
Whenever I compliment Simone, you take the credit.
Yes, you do...  Anyway, tonight was a good start.
This is crazy.  Who am I fooling? I can't compete with Simone.  What woman can?
That's sweet, Viktor, but I couldn't let you do that -- make that kind of sacrifice.  It's strange.  I've stabbed people in the back, clawed and slept my way to where I am -- it goes with the territory -- but, for some reason, I can't betray Simone. There's... I don't know any other way to say it -- there's a goodness to her.
Of course she will.  Her public will demand it.
Hello?
I can't believe she's doing this -- taking advantage of him this way. It's cruel.
You understand you'll have to come back to my place to keep them off the, er...  ... scent.
What?... What did you say?
Nudity has just never been an issue for me, Frank.  For me, clothes are just an option.
That's true.  I can reveal that I am considering a career in politics.
You'll never guess who I'm with... you ran into him on the lot.
You know I sometimes forget she has bodily functions.
No.  In fact, between us, she doesn't really exist.
You already do.  But my actor won't get old, fat, lazy or drunk -- won't throw tantrums, demand a body double, script changes or a bigger trailer.  The Disney Corporation has been using artificial actors for years.
I won't be here next week.  The tumor's inoperable.  I'll be dead.
I'm sorry Mom canned you.
Those things can be dangerous. Staring at a screen all day -- you miss what's going on outside in the real world.  You can lose yourself. You should get out more.  How are you going to meet boys?
Okay, Dad.
So that accounts for the lack of a shadow in reel six?
Good-night, Daddy.
I know but Mom doesn't.  Maybe if it came from Simone, if Simone spoke to Mom -- she could straighten things out.  Dinner, maybe.
-- Plead guilty and throw yourself on the mercy of the court.  It's the best deal you're going to get.
I remember when the Echo had class -- the paper that could bring down governments.
So they're probably here.  You might be able to sell this 'disappearing act' to the rest of the world, but I'm not buying it. What's really behind this Simone woman?  The public has a right to know.  Why is she staying out of sight?  And why the hell is she with you?  I don't want you to take this the wrong way, Viktor, but you're not exactly Cecil B. DeMille -- more run-of-the-mill.
The cops?  The cops read my column to know who to bust.  We're the only watchdog the public has.  None of this is going away.  We'll be here tomorrow and the day after that.  Until you slip up.  And you will.  You are looking at your shadow.  Because all these elaborate precautions with Simone -- every instinct in my body tells me, it's not natural.
I know what you're up to.
I know that's what you'd like us to believe.  But I got to tell you -- embezzlement is a serious matter. Not to mention abduction.
Alright, Sayer, you've got a deal.
I traced her to a nursing home.  A young woman fitting Simone's description dropped her off five years ago.
Whatever it is, it's dark.
Shutter bugs camped outside any place he goes, every concierge and maitre d' on the take.  But this Simone woman is good.
Mr. Sayer...
Would you like me to read?
Let's take it down a notch.
You mean they buy it?
Mr. Taransky, we both know I was nothing without you.  I was computer code -- ones and zeros.
The only real truth is in the work.
Wow. They called you their son.
--My God.
Why did you leave me?
I got an award once. From the Mayor.
Everybody got upset. They had a meeting. Momma started crying.  I don't draw like that anymore.
Where should I look then, Cole?
He hates me.
Mr. Marschal gets real lonely.
Think about what you want from our time together. What our goal should be?
Yes.
What makes you think that?
I don't know how the story ends. I hope it's a happy ending.
Dead people, like in graves and coffins?
You weren't a paper champion.
What if they don't want help? What if they're just angry and they want to hurt somebody?
I think we said everything we needed to say.  Maybe it's time to say things to someone else? Someone close to you?
What are you thinking, Momma?
You can see her?
What are you thinking, Momma?
Cole, that's very wrong. Grandma's gone. You know that.
She wanted me to tell you--
Yes, Cole?
Excuse me?
Stuttering Stanley! Stuttering Stanley!
The last time was a Chuck E. Cheese party a year ago. He hid in one of those purple plastic tunnels and didn't come out.
Maybe you don't want to remember.
I'd watch your step if I were you, son.
Okay, Farm Boy. Joke's over. You've been playin' me from jump street. Where's my Nikes?
Bitch.
I happen to be a professional.
You have a strong unfufilled desire.
Hey, isn't that the preacher?
There's something weird going on here, Suzie.
Thought your boy and his band were only staying the night.
Nike specials. Two hundred bucks.
Curt Cobain.
Well, there goes our record deal.
Hmmm. This shit isn't bad.
Carl! Oh Carrrrl!
What are you going to do? Shoot me?
Joseph Macdonald... Your son.
I came back for the funeral. That's all.
That old barn. After the fire... I rebuilt it nail by nail. Just the way your granddaddy would've wanted it.
Sure. What do you want to know.
Hallelujah! ...Civilization... here I come!
You wanna know the difference? The difference is that you're screwing up the song.
Is that right?
Time for a little... "feedback" guys. That guy from Hectic Records --
Name something.
What's wrong?
We're almost ready. What the hell are you doing out here?
Suzie --
What are --
...no... Mac... p-please...
Yeah. Great work, Rod. But next time, it would be nice... if you could JOIN US FOR THE ENTIRE SET!
What is it?!!
Where's Mac?
It gets worse. He's cut all the phone lines.
That young lady heard you say 'squid.' She's gonna go out and create a Goddamn hysteria!
What?
And that makes you look like a squid?
Bill, I heard what you're doing. I think I should go along.
Was always curious why you... married Grant in the first place... Just never seemed outta love.
My father, he was -- he was real close to evil. People didn't know. Still don't. From the time I was a toddler he'd beat the hell out of me. I don't mean just like a smack for smart--mouthing... he took a real enjoyment in it. And when I turned eleven or twelve, things... well, they got worse. Starla looks at Bill, who seems struck.
It's my nature.
When I buy my zoo, I'm leaving them things the hell out!
You dig that rat out of the hole?
I can't hear when you're nodding.
Where's the old half--Mexican?
Guess it's hard to explain how amazin' a human brain is to someone who that's all they know.
Flip.
Who's that?
I'll get if for you.
Why'd you betray me, sugarplum?!
But not always. I was -- He was... other stuff too.
Praise Jesus.
You.
You're crazy, man. Smart dresser, but crazy.
I hear a few weeks ago you smuggled sixteen Beaners up to West Virginia.
Four hundred cases worth.  Well?
Look, I'm a twenty-eight year old hoofer who spends most of her time with fags. Besides, I'm impulsive. It runs in the family. We're all crazy. Mind if I smoke?  Anyway, today was the 'bid day.' But as I was walking down the aisle, I realized this is total insanity. What am I going to do in Texas the rest of my life? I can't marry Jerry Jeff. I mean, we're eventually gonna have to talk. So, halfway down the aisle, I turned and split. You think I'm nuts, right?
You have a great profile.
Where you from?
Seriously?!?
Can I ask you something?
You know, you're not a bad driver.
That's a Texas cop. What the hell's he doing in Arkansas?
Well?
The bus'll pick you up over there.  Uh... you got enough bread for a ticket?
Jesus!!!
Yeah.
I guess if there's one lesson I've learned, it's that even misery has a tough time hitting a moving target.  I forgot your question?
Kate...
I been thinking. Maybe I should drop you in Montgomery. I mean, the way things are going, it might get pretty hairy by the time we get to Atlanta.
-- Actually, my heaviest relationship was with a rock singer named Ramblin' Bobby Holt. When I turned twenty- one, I went to Europe with visions of being free and independent. My luck, he was on the plane. I landed in Paris and fell in love before I could claim my baggage.  We were together for almost a year. I thought he was it.
He's just exhausted.
See ya, Bandit.
I'm working, Bandit. Besides, what's the matter? Won't your new girl friend help you?
What do you want me to do, Hot Pants? Beg?
I'm begging.
But you'll do it?
No what?
Believe me, man; Fred'll be no problem.
Our asses gonna be in a sling if we get caught.
We gotta let the slack out, Cledus; this is costing us time.
Also boring.
All right, here's our plan of communication, so as to avoid Smokey.
Now, if I say go to channel three, it really means go to six.
Bandit I, do you copy?
Thirty-eight minutes ahead of schedule.
I'm 'bout four miles ahead of you, turkey.
My vocal cords are fine, but Fred's ain't. He's been barking, eating the seats and driving me crackers.  Hear that? Where's his chow?
Do I have a choice?
I hate to say it...
-- How we doing?
Talk to me.
I'm all ears.
Bandit I, let me offer my heartiest congratulations and a piece of advice.
How's the clock, Bandit II.
Breaker. Breaker.
Thanks for the break. Bandit, this here's the Dixie Chicken.
Gimme three sloppy joes and a coupla cups of hot stuff.
This is Bandit I. Over.
Bandit II. We'll be back on the highway in a second. Over.
I'm Kate. You must be Cledus.
Is that Bandit in the lead?
I still think this whole idea is dumb, pop.
But if it can't be done, how's he gonna do it?
That crazy sumbitch made it.
-- Did ya hear they nailed the Bandit?
It's gotta be tough keeping an eye on everything.
Yes, but no -- we have personnel stationed at both ends of that hall, twenty-four hours a day.
Spotter on the lake confirmed Israel. Penthouse level. There was apparently a fisticuffs with some prostitutes. He wasn't involved. He's also had his people phone a local madame for another group of girls.
He's giving them up?
He uh -- he asked about -- I'm -- he wanted to know whic-- what floor security was on, then I saw him get on the elevator with the other agent.
And when you saw him later, he was wearing one of your security jackets --
I did. We -- yeah, I know.
About cocaine... and the amount you're doing.
No. Sorry comes later, when you're in a partial coma with ambulatory paralysis. Sorry comes when we have to decide which of your limbs have to be amputated because severely constricted blood flow has brought about a gangrenous infection, sorry --
I know his location, we've got the drop of a maybe half a day before that location gets grape-vined and the rest of the world gets hipped.
...I'm sorry...
They're gonna give on this in the next ten seconds or the deal's off!
-- Buddy, it's bigger than that, they want 'em all, Ivy, Beanie --
Sparazza is rumored to have performed in excess of one-hundred and thirty contract murders, including one of the bureau's most celebrated agents. Freeman Heller. You heard of "The Turnpike Murders" that was Sparazza.
My debrief --
...Yeah, fifty-three.
...holy shit... that's Heller...  Isn't it?
-- yeah, now lemme finish, I was eavesdroppin', so give me sec, lay this thing out, since the information might be a little loose --
No question, no, you're right. We gotta do what's good for us now.
Well just so I got a quote in my head. What's the rate for the Swede?
So how we lookin'?
-- No, no, not when y'can see the shore. I hear ya.
Georgia on my mind wit'yo fine ass. You know you saved this black man.
-- never in a million girl --
My mamma? C'mon shorty, y'gotta ask?  You hurtin' pretty bad?
Why?
-- It's your IFB, somebody else has got an earpiece, you're picking up their signal --
What else did Padiche say?
Forty-five apiece for you two, ten percent finders fee for me.
Gibarian.
You think you're dreaming me, like you dream her.  Understand something: I am the real Gibarian.  Just a new incarnation.
You'll end up like me.
You have to give me your word you won't come in.  Then I'll come out.
Listen --
That's fantastic.
You murdered her!
She'll come back.
You fucking bastard...
What's wrong?  What happened to Gibarian?
You didn't bring any chocolate, did you?
Tell me.  I won't think you're insane.
It started about three months ago. Right after the government sold the expedition.  We were ready to go home.
An enormous amount of money changed hands to get control of this project. We are in little danger of being left alone for long.  You'll need to do something. Otherwise they'll be sending someone out to recover you.
We can liquidate the station.  Take the Athena back.
Perhaps it did.
What happened?
What plan?
I need to see Snow.
Don't.
I don't know.  I can't be alone.
You behave as though you want to fuck her.
Do you remember Beethoven?  The Beatles?  Movies, books, restaurants, friends?
What happened?
Where've you been?
I would have these -- I don't know how to describe them -- visions, when I was younger.  Maybe not visions, but like these waking dream states.  Time would just collapse, I would be inside time.  I would stare at a second hand on a clock until it stopped.  Freaky stuff.
Sartorius wants to destroy it.
I'm sure there are worse people to talk to, but I don't know who they are.
But we fought.
That won't happen again.  We're different.
No.
You never said you wanted one.
You're lying.
Did you hear what Gibarian said? I'm not a human being.  I'm an instrument.  I came from your memory and your imagination and I will torture you no matter what.  Even if I remain passive.  That's when I drank the...  I was going mad.  It felt like there was no body underneath my skin. There was something else.  An illusion.  But I could feel my heart beating, and I remembered you tested my blood.  Is it like yours?
You have to remember that I love you, that's all that matters --
They are not autonomous individuals and they're not actual persons. They are projections materializing from our minds, based on a given individual.
Gibarian was under enormous --
And so what's with Steinhart?  Is it serious?
It's terrific Win.
I've never seen anyone killed before.
Right.  That's true.
Would you pick one out, please?
You all right?
I guess I'm supposed to do it in the morning.  Identify him.
You were reading my Renoir.
You know why they're like that...? He was myopic... going blind.
You could do better.
What do you want to do?
You don't want to know.
I'm taking them all out to Queens, as a matter of fact, right in your neighborhood.  There's an event at my Father's school... an anniversary... I thought maybe you could come...
Where?
Claire...
It wouldn't work.
I'd miss my life...
You still going away?
I like your coat.
Hello, Claire.  How extraordinary that you came.
Well, of course, we'd be... honored...
Hey, can we go to McDonald's?
Tommy...!
Ellie, you know I think it's about time we got outa this place, get us a house of our own.  We can afford it now.
Changing the sparks.  They showed it on TV.  What d'you think?
Honey.  You got him.
Because the the only way to stop crime is to identify criminals.  I can't believe you're talking this way Mister Detective -- I think she's got a lot of guts.
What did she say the down payment was?
Should I wait up?  We've got to get up early for the beach tomorrow.
What?
Mike, take it easy...
It's not your fault.  Mike, please get off the case.
I'm sorry.  I know I heard noises... the detective's wife...
You gotta get another tour.  We're gettin' too old for this.
They're operating on him.  He's still alive.
Shit!  A Nursemaid!  My first detail, and I'm a fuckin' slug!  I got a 'choice' at all.
Not Koontz.
Uh, yeah.  I'm a policeman.
Yes.
You're not going to talk to anyone without a lawyer.
You made a terrible mistake, Keegan. You didn't do what I said.
Why should she come in?
Bullshit!  Prove it.
How do you know where the gun is?
What "plans?"  You and Mom got "plans?"
What!  What kind of pathetic line is that?
You coming in?
Well, look who's dressing for success.
What, want a glass?
Ah, ya know.  Neighborhood's not what it used to be.  Kid no more'n five swiped a candy bar the other day.
Ya still follow the Mets, Pete?
S'funny.  When your mom and dad, uh, passed away, I had this idea. I wanted you to be the best baseball player in the world.
Ya set for, uh, ya know-- money?
Cause if you get in a bind--
I was there.
Hey, guys.  Check it out-- I saw this dud on the tube last night. He is incredibly cool.
"Harry Osborne diminishes the stature of the University."
Great idea.  Let me get some shoes. I'll take you home.
You're so responsible it's disgusting. But you're my only friend... do you hate me?
You get mugged or something?
How are you doing, kid?
Too hip.  Your photos suck, kid.
You taking extension classes, Mr. Jameson?
Can we make it a hundred?
I got a question, college boy.  What the hell am I supposed to do with these!?  I ask for disaster, pathos, what do I get?  Salvador Dali!  When I want artsy-fartsy double-exposures, I'll ask for--
Thank you.  Now, repeat after me-- Spider-Man is a good guy. On the side of right, and niceness, and cute baby animals and all that.
You're making my life difficult.
An even five I throw in the jacket.
I see.  So, Amazing Spider-Man-- I'll assume that's not your given name--
All right, amazing.  Are you quite finished?
He left.  I couldn't believe it-- he just left!  It's as if he's somewhere else... I'm only getting a piece of him.
Fill in the blank: "I blank Elizabeth Allan."
Uh is a good start.
I hate--
-- but the dogs treed him between Huxley and Kafka.
Sit down and stop being such a child.
They keep saying there's nothing I could've done.  That's a lie.  I could've done something.  If only I'd paid attention to my feelings.
May's much better. She'll be out soon.
This may be the end of a beautiful friendship, you know.
You sure about all this?
No such thing as coincidence.  "God does not play dice with the universe."
Yeah, Roz.
Aunt May, you're trespassing.
The record--
A match made in heaven.
Is this some sort of Zen thing?
My… self.  I don't matter.  This human life, all life- insignificant.  Bodies-- bags of sleepy, sluggish flesh.
Need any more help?
You never know.  Go get some sleep.
Hello, uh, Mr. Reiss?  I'm-- I'm the guy who wrestled Hulk Hogan the other day.  The guy in the mask?
Mr. Reiss-- I need a quarter--
He'll try to finish his experiment.
I listened to him talk of eternal truth and thought of the Bhagavad Gita, the Indian holy book-- "I am become Shiva, Death-- the destroyer of worlds."  Octavius was...
Spider-Man, be careful!  He's quite mad.
Professor, you ever fly one of these things before?
Where's Hoffy? Why don't we get any news about Dunbar?
They ought to be under the barbed wire soon.
W-w-will that do or do you want some m-m-m --?
I understand how you feel, Cookie. It's sort of rough -- one American squealing on other Americans. Then again, Cookie -- maybe that stoolie's not an American at all. Maybe he's a German the Krauts planted in this barracks. They do this type of thing. Just put an agent in with us -- a trained specialist. Lots of loose information floating around a prison camp. Not just whether somebody wants to escape, but what outfits we were with and where we were stationed, and how our radar operates. Could be, couldn't it?
Why not? Just one of the boys. Sharing our bunks. Eating our chow. Right in amongst the ones that beat me up. Except that he beat hardest.
Now what kind of a crack is that?
You would, would you? Listen, Stupe -- the first week I was in this joint somebody stole my Red Cross package, my blanket and my left shoe. Well, I wised up since. This ain't no Salvation Army -- this is everybody for himself. Dog eat dog.
You make my mouth water.
Next we're going to auction off your department store -- and your stable.
Break it off!
The S.S. Men are here to pick up Dunbar. They're taking him to Berlin. Looks like he's finished.
Then we're all in on it?
Shut off the moaning, or we'll have the dogs on us. Shut it off, Lieutenant. This is orders!
You'd better get that blue blood circulating, because we're busting out of this stink-hole in exactly --  -- one minute and twenty seconds.
You won't get off that cheap.
105-353.
You have no idea how boring my life here is. If it weren't for an occasional air raid or some foolish prisoners trying to escape, I wouldn't know what to do. I want to thank you for keeping me company. I don't drink, I don't smoke, I don't read. I hate music. That only leaves good conversation. It will be a shame to lose you.
There will be two S.S. men here tomorrow to take you to Berlin. You will be interrogated by the General Staff. When you come to the part about your arrest, I'm sure you won't forget to give me the proper credit.
It is.
Jawohl!
Hey, Schulz! I got a deal for you. Suppose you help us escape. We'll go home and have everything ready for you in Madison Square Garden. For the world championship! Schulz, the Beast of Bavaria versus Halitosis Jones!
Coffee? Milk? Or how about a little cocoa?
You can say that again!
No you don't! You don't want any broads with boots on!
What d'ya think, jerko! You're the award!
Ain't that too bad! Tomorrow he'll have to suck a raw egg!
That's what I wanna hear.
Sugar-lips Shapiro! Frightening, ain't it?
Do Grable.
I'll open mine now.
You don't want to cry over a dame that doesn't even know you're alive! Snap out of it!
As the duly elected Compound Chief, I protest the way these bodies are left lying in the mud.
Don't worry. We'll take care of it.
Just as you say, Hoffy. But wouldn't it be smarter if I went out and kept Schulz tied up?
We've all done a poor job of it.
Los, los. Dummkopf!
Sometimes I think he is fooling us with that crazy business.
We know! We got them last year. Five minutes after the Geneva Man was gone, the blankets were gone.
If I were you, Sefton, I'd eat that egg some place else. Like for instance under the barrack.
What's the matter, boys? Is my slip showing?
You heard that, Sefton?
Right.
Hurry up on that trap.  What are you trying to do, Sefton? Gum up the works?
Pirelli. Coleman. Agnew. Shapiro.
Shapiro. Shapiro.
Stop that, will you!  Those idiots! So they sprang Dunbar! So what good is it? He's still in the compound, isn't he? How long can he last? Where can they hide him?
No. I don't sprechen sie deutsch.
Six o'clock. I was having dinner.
Wie hat er's gemacht?
Du lieber Gott! How do you look? You had a fight?
Three hundred cigarettes! What is it you want from me?
What's the matter with you? You want to be killed?
Is it all right if we smell it?
The Captain would make a much more valuable hostage.
It's working.
I thought he was the Chief Engineer.
Captain=8A
Data?
Guinan said Soran was trying to get back to the ribbon. If that's true, then there must be some connection with the Amargosa star.
Fear is a very difficult emotion to overcome. It's something we all have to learn to deal with.
He can't go to the ribbon, so he's trying to make the ribbon come to him.  Data, is it going to pass near any M-Class planets?
Well?
What?
I don't see a control panel, or an access port.
Data, are you all right?
I have rerouted auxiliary power to the lateral thrusters- attempting to level our descent.
Deck 15, section 21-alpha.
It took a long time, but eventually I learned to live with it. And I began to realize that my experience in the Nexus had changed me.  I knew things about people, about events, about time.
Guinan, what's going on? Where am I?
This is the Nexus?
Where is he now?
Can I?
I know exactly where I want to go, and when. Back to that mountaintop on Veridian III, before Soran put out the star. I have to stop him.
This clock, I gave this clock to Bones.
Antonia?
Captain of the Enterprise, huh?
I'll find a way to contact the Enterprise. You're going to be all right.
Yes.  Thank you.
I'm not going  Scotty, help me with this chute.
But I do have a theory...
A remarkable piece of equipment, but a little inelegant, wouldn't you say?  Have you ever considered a prosthesis that would make you look a little more...normal?
Normal is what everyone else is, and what you are not.
I don't want a science lecture. You were on that observatory looking for trilithium. Why?
Imagine what it was like, Will. No engines, no computers, just the wind, the sea and the stars to guide you.
Sir, is there anything wrong?
That's a pretty big margin of error.
I always thought I'd have a crack at this chair one day.
We're all mortal, Soran. It's one of the truths of ou existence.
Have Geordi and Data go over with the next Away Team. Tell them to scan the observatory for trilithium.
Sensor records show a solar probe was launched from the observatory a few moments ago.
What's going on? When do we get paid off...?
Unit two, this is One. The Kobayashi Maru has set sail for the promised land. Acknowledge.
Excelsior closing to 4,000 meters, sir.
You did great, Bones... Just great.
What's Grissom up to?... Will they join us, or fire on us...?  Chekov, break radio  silence. Send my compliments to Captain Esteban.
Admiral, there is no response from the Grissom on any channel.
Still no response, sir.
I'd swear something was there sir, but I might have imagined it.
Sir... Something's jamming our transmission. An energy surge.
Why don't we beam it up?
Approximately two meters long... Cylindrical in form...
Saavik to Grissom. Request computer study of soil samples for geological aging.
My readings indicate great instability.
Well. There's your life form reading. These were microbes on the tube's surface. We shot them here from Enterprise.  They were fruitful, and multiplied.
You mean, we're stranded down here?!
Why?
Protomatter. An unstable substance which every ethical scientist in the galaxy has denounced as dangerously unpredictable.
Very well. Exercise caution, Lieutenant. This landing is Captain's discretion and I'm the one who's out on a limb.
I'm sure Starfleet would approve, sir.
Eight weeks, sir.  But you don't have eight weeks so I'll do it for ya in two.
As promised, she's all yours, sir. All systems automated and ready. A chimpanzee and two trainees could run her.
Mr. Scott: two photon torpedoes at the ready. Sight on the center of the mass.
I'm all right -- stand by to return fire! Mr. Scott, transfer power to the phaser banks --
How many more?
Is there <U>anything</U> we can do?!
On course, Admiral. Estimating Spacedock in two point one hours.
Count on our help, sir.
... We have cleared Spacedoors.
Warp Speed, Mr. Sulu...
Sir, planet core readings unstable... Changing rapidly...
Close... There --
The planet Vulcan. In hailing distance, sir.
Mr. Sulu, you're on manual.
Would you look at that?
But, we had requested -- we were hoping to take her back to Genesis...
May I ask why...?
No, Jim! Enterprise would never stand the pounding.
Out of the question! The Council has ordered that no one but the science team goes to Genesis!
But -- why?
Then, how --
... He spoke of your friendship.
I have been... and always shall be... your friend. Live long... and prosper!
Forgive me. It is not here. I assumed he had mind-melded with you. It is the Vulcan way when the body's end is near.
Please wait!... Surely he would have found a way! If there was so much at stake -- Spock would have found a way!
What I have done, I had to do.
So!  Speak!
We are going to this "planet." Even as our emissaries negotiate for "peace" with the Federation, we will <U>act</U> for the preservation of our race! We will seize the secret of this weapon. The secret of ultimate power!
I'll be in my quarters. Execute course to the Federation Boundary.
1,000 Kellicams, closing!
Sir, may I --
We still have the prisoners, sir. Perhaps their information --
Well, maybe that's okay for someone like you whose career is winding down. But me: I need some challenge in my life. Some adventure... Even just a surprise or two.
Are you out of your Vulcan mind? No human can tolerate the radiation loose in there!
You're not going in there -- !
I'm almost afraid to. What did you bring me, contraband Klingon --
Uh -- what are they?
But I'm allergic to Retlax.
Slide them down your nose. Now look at me over the top. And you read printed matter through the bottom.
Say thank you.
They even killed the galley chief.
Lieutenant, you are looking at the only Starfleet cadet who ever beat the no-win scenario --
<u>Will you please be quiet</u>!  Commander Chekov, this is completely irregular. Who gave the order you are quoting? Who gave the order?
... Can't read you... repeat...
Wait --
Will you please be quiet! We must have order here.  This has to be some sort of mistake.
Damn! Are you sure? Maybe the scanner's out of adjustment --
All right, let's get on the Comm-pic to Doctor Marcus. Maybe it's something we can transplant.
You're crazy -- !
Khan, listen to me! Captain Kirk was only doing his duty! You --
I would think so, sir. He's on the Fleet General Staff.
Where's Dr. Marcus --
Why didn't you tell me?
I'm trying, David.
What are <u>you</u> looking at?
They're requesting visual communications, sir.
Careful: Not all at once. <u>The</u> <u>engine room</u>. Lock on target and prepare to fire.
Departing dark side, Regula.
No sir! We have Genesis -- Whatever you want --
-- But I wanted you to know first who it was who had beaten you: I, Khan Noonian Singh, the eagle you attempted to cage forever.
Genesis, what's that?
Khan, how do I know you'll keep your word?
Kirk! Kirk, you are still alive -- my old friend...
Goodbye, Admiral. Oh, and don't count on Enterprise. She can't move. My next act will be to blow her out of the heavens.
An emergency situation has arisen. By order of Starfleet Command, as of now, 1800 hours, I am assuming command of this vessel. Duty officer so note in the ship's log. Plot a new course: for Space Laboratory Regula I.  Mr. Scott?
Just barely, sir.
Enterprise to Reliant. Come in, Reliant.
... No response, sir.
Saavik, for God's sake, tell her we're all right.
Midshipman, you're a tiger.
The energizer's bypassed like a Christmas tree -- so don't give me too many bumps.
Kirk to Enterprise. Damage report, Spock?
I believe you'll find everything shipshape, Admiral.
It had the virtue of never having been tried.
So you said at the time. Speaking of which, your prot‚g‚'s first rare -- a trifle emotional --
Hrummm... and where are you off to, now?
Carol Marcus --
Gentlemen, this isn't --
They knew just where to hit us.
You've got to learn WHY things work on a Starship.  It's coming through now, Khan...
A distinct possibility.
Estimating nebula penetration in two minutes. Reliant is closing.
That was a little joke.
This is damned peculiar.  Yellow alert.
Khan!
<u>WHAT</u>?
Course plotted for Regula I, Admiral...
Phaser lock inoperative, sir.
He's very human.
Take her out, Mr. Saavik.
To Earth. To offer testimony.
I would accept that as an axiom.
I prefer a dose of common sense. you are proposing to head backwards in time, find Humpback Whales, then bring them forward in time, drop them off - and hope they tell this Probe what to do with itself!
It doesn't look all that different.
Oh, joy.
Hi... Busy?
Specifically, Humpback Whales.
Fundoscopic examination --
Can you isolate the wave?
Damage report!
... It gives me a great sense of history.
All right, Commander, you wanna tell us anything?
My name is Pavel Chekov. I am a Lt. Commander in Starfleet, United Federation of Planets, service number 656-5827b.
The top of what?
Yes, sir.
To hunt a species to extinction is not logical.
You mean man...
There's really very little point in my trying to explain.
He's harmless.  Back in the sixties he was part of the Free Speech movement at Berkeley. I think he did too much LDS.
We don't want to be any trouble.
They're gonna hafta take their chances.
Just a little joke. See you later, old friend.
He's just going to hang around the bushes while we eat?
Wanna try it from the top?
Don't tell me: you're from outer space.
I'm all ears.
Well, "Admiral," that may be the strangest dinner of my life and the biggest cockamamie fish story I've ever heard.
Here... In the park?
It's true... what you said...
Steady, now. We need your help.
We'll bring them up just like we brought you. It's called a transporter beam...
... Gone?!
If we keep going up, they'll catch us!
You tricked me.
But we can't turn away! Is there no alternative?
Ready to engage computer, Admiral.
The late 20th Century.
As you observed, a primitive Culture.
Admiral, may I ask you a question?
Come on, fellah -- speak up!
Mr. Spock, where the hell is the power you promised me?
Estimating Planet Earth one point six hours present speed.
Warp two... three...
Mr. Sulu...? ... Mr. Sulu?!
I have no control, sir!
I'll have bearing and distance for you, sir.
Estimate range, ship to whales!
Scotty, we have to find some Humpbacks.
You'll work it out, Scotty. And remember: two of them.
What is it? I thought I told you never to call me --
Stay with me, sir -- I need more power curve...
I'll have to re-energize.
Stand by, sir. Miracle worker at work...
You better get up there, sir. We're having some power fall-off...
Yes, I noticed. Now suppose -- just suppose -- I could show you a way to manufacture a wall that would do the same job but was only an inch thick. would that be worth something to you, eh?
Yes, of course... Do you have any message for your mother?
Chotto omachi nasarei. Namae wa nanto moosareruka na.  Wait my son. What is your name?
You have warp capability?
I understand how you feel. We just want to retrace Data's movements that day...
I don't like to leave questions unanswered.
Don't panic...
A perfect moment?
There's a cavern at the base of the next hill...
But I have three hundred and eighteen days of vacation time coming. I plan on using them.
Do you really think your mighty Federation would be interested in protecting six hundred people?
I know why.  So people like us won't be afraid of you any more.
To many offlanders, what you have here would be more valuable than gold-pressed latinum.  And I'm afraid it's the reason that someone is trying to take this world away from you.
Very funny...
Prepare to transport the 'hostages' to the ship...
It isn't safe for you to remain in this area.
We're taking this ship out of here... this mission is over...
I do not take orders from you.
You have no idea what precipitated his behavior?
Captain, I wasn't expecting you.
On Earth, petroleum once turned petty thugs into world leaders. Warp drive transformed a bunch of Romulan thugs into an empire. We can handle the Son'a, I'm not worried about that...
With metaphasics, lifespans will be doubled... an entire new medical science will evolve...  I understand your Chief Engineer has the use of his eyes for the first time in his life... would you take his sight away from him?
I wonder... which one of us will be facing that court-martial...
But I would need at least three minutes on the bridge.
Admiral Dougherty will not be joining us for diner. Deploy the collector.  Do you have a problem with those orders?
Sir, they've detonated an isolytic burst... a subspace tear is forming...
They're powering their forward weapons array.
They need us to mediate some territorial dispute...
You must be planning on doing some hunting.
I... I must have slept through my alarm. I'm on my way...
Worf to Picard...
Captain...
I've already modified a tricorder with one of his spare actuation servos. Its operational range is only seven meters but it should shut him down...
He might be using the planet's rings to mask his approach.
Sir, if we fire a tachyon burst, it may force him to reset his shield harmonics. When he does, we could beam him out...
Direct hit. He's resetting his shield harmonics...
Sir, inertial coupling is exceeding tolerance... if we don't release him, he may destroy both vessels...
Did any of the hostages mention a cloaked ship during their debriefings?
We've downloaded all the files on the duck blind mission as well as intelligence reports on the Son'a.
Why would we be involved with these people?
It says here that some form of genetic damage has apparently prevented the Son'a from procreating...
Come in.  Hi.
Both.  I think I'm having a mid-life crisis...
What I need, I can't get from Doctor Crusher...  Counselor, do you think it's possible for two people to go back in time to fix a mistake they've made?
The new quantum torpedoes are doing the trick, Jean-Luc. We've destroyed forty-seven Borg ships so far... and only lost fifteen of our own.  But one of the Borg ships has broken through our defenses, and it's heading directly for Earth. Can you handle it?
Go where? Hello? Is anyone going to tell me what we're doing here?
But he's been dead for three hundred...  Oh God... we've gone back in time again, haven't we?
There must be some good people... even in this time.
You actually performed surgery...?
You are the guiding intelligence behind the Borg...?
Have you ever wondered what it's like to have flesh?
Do you know what this is, Data?
I am... grateful for what you have given me. But I still do not wish to be assimilated.
No... no, it's so... empty... please... give it back... I need it...
Can you configure it?
We are approaching the Terran System, Captain.
Juice?
Where's the battery room for the hospital?
Captain, I'm starting to worry about the hull integrity. We've been running the support field at full power for three hours straight. I don't know how much longer it's going to hold up.
Alphanumeric lock. We need a password to get in...
Picard to Enterprise.  Enterprise, please respond.
Ready to deploy the warp nacelles.
The Vulcans should be out there right now. We need to break the warp barrier in the next five minutes if we're going to get their attention.
The inertial dampers are having trouble compensating... I don't think Cochrane built this thing for comfort.
Oh...  yes... ultraviolet protection. Thank you. Mister...?
Where in the States?
Where are you from most recently?
And what were you doing out at the missile silo?
What do you want?
There is no invasion...
Take care of him. He's a very special man.
Did you need something?
Bed sheets.  I used my last set of bed sheets to make those prints. Not the best material, but I haven't seen a clean piece of paper in five years.
No... but sometimes I feel that way.  What I meant was, I'd be willing to trade for the photographs.
Were the two of you... involved?
We?
Signal the Endeavor to fall back. We'll cover them.
Track their weapons fire.
Hull integrity down to thirty percent...
Good luck, sir.
Return to our own time?
What the hell is happening, Worf?
And Commander, whatever you do... do <U>not</U> vomit in your exo-suit. It would be... unpleasant.
Wil... Data was down there.
Mr. President we cannot allow Federation citizens to be abducted.
I believe the operation is over.
Bet you wish you'd stood in bed...
Calm yourself, doctor, the operation is almost complete...
Sweet Jesus...! He's lost a lot of whatever this stuff is...
No!
- <U>Kobayashi Maru</U>...
Are we playing multiple choice?
What is it with you, anyway?
ARE YOU CRAZY?
Time we got underway ourselves, gentlemen.  Once again, we've saved civilization as we know it.
We're explorers not diplomats!
For 27 years I have been Ship's Surgeon and later Chief Medical Officer aboard the USS Enterprise. In three months I'm due to stand down.
Was Chancellor Gorkon alive when you first examined him?
I tried to save him! I was desperate to save him! He was the last best hope in the universe for real peace.
What are you in for, if you don't mind me asking?
I've always wanted to meet you, Captain.
Would you care to go topside?
You deny Enterprise fired on KRONOS One?
Captain Kirk, are you aware that under Federation law, the Captain of a Starship is considered responsible for the actions of his men?
Where is Mr. Sulu?
Captain, if they fire at us with our shields down --
You're forgetting something.  the data banks say WE fired. If we did, the killers are here; if we didn't, whoever altered the data banks is here. Either way, what we're searching for is here...
Now we expand our search to include uniforms.
Send to commander Enterprise: "We stand ready to assist you. Captain Sulu, USS Excelsior." Attach our co-ordinates.
This is KRONOS One. I am Chancellor Gorkon.
Chancellor, may I present Commander Spock, whom I believe you know, Dr. Leonard McCoy, chief medical officer, Montgomery Scott, chief engineer...
Your research laboratory is most impressive...
Thank you, Captain Kirk. The evening has been most... edifying.
I've heard of chameloids - "Shapeshifters" - I thought you were mythical.
We don't get many presidential assassins.
How much time's left of your sentence?
That's not his knee.  Not everybody keeps their genitals in the same place, Captain.
Maybe if their particles just got a wee bit mixed...
Aye, sir.
We're almost at the rendezvous - I thought you'd want to know...
Uhura, hailing frequencies. Right standard rudder, bring us alongside...
Saavik, you know anything about a neutron energy surge?
Who is "US?"
Surely not.
I know your father's the Vulcan Ambassador for heaven's sake, but you know how I feel about this: they're animals.
Lieutenant, I am pleased to see you.  The Lieutenant is the first Vulcan to be graduated at the top of her class as the Academy.
I believe the Captain feels that Starfleet's mission has always been one of peace -
What is it?
What the -
I was blind. I couldn't see past the death of my son. I couldn't trust.
You couldn't have known she was listening the night I dictated that entry into my log. You were proud of her achievements as a Vulcan.
Captain, perhaps we're going about this the wrong way; our job is to get to the conference; HER job will be to stop us.
The only way to find out if a man's trustworthy...
Channel open, Captain.
Captain, we can't see her, but she gives off heat...
Very well. For twenty-four hours we'll agree that this conversation did not take place.
We can send a message to Starfleet Command -
Sorry to wake you, sir, but Starfleet urgently requests any data we may have on the whereabouts of Enterprise.
Don't tell me that was any meteor shower.
A computer canna lie, sir.
They dinna fire on themselves. And there were no other ships present.
Too far off. Very near us. Perhaps... underneath us...
They're naturally wary, ma'am. We've been at war a long time.
I assume command of this ship as of  0130 hours. Uhura, send to Starfleet HQ. Explain precisely what has taken place, and request instructions.
They might as well arrest me, too; I felt like Lieutenant Saavik.
Fuzzy face is gone.
Do you know who I am?
Do you have any knowledge of the tactical abi1ities of this ship?
No. I must deactivate you.
Beverly, come in.
Remember him?
Aside from slightly elevated adrenalin and serotonin levels, you're completely normal.
They're running me ragged. Nothing but question day and night... I love it! Come to dinner and 1'1 tell you all about it. There's a Bajoran band at the officer's mess.
And you were particularly aware of this feeling because Commander Riker will be leaving to assume command of the Titan?
If I were... I believe my memory engrams would sense the absence of your specific reactions and behavior. I would "miss you."
The closest signature is two kilometers to the west... that direction, sir.
The final signature is approx- imately 300 meters up that incline.
Data to Captain Picard. Geordi and I have identified the source of the unauthorized computer access. And, I believe, we have also discovered an opportunity to gain a tactical advantage.
Ready, Captain.
"For now we see but through a glass darkly..." He said he's a mirror.
He may have already rejected my humanity, but you also have a twin
Yes, sir. The Rift effects all long-range communications.
Sir, allow me to go. You are needed here.
Isolated pockets of humanoids. It appears to be a pre-warp civilization at an early stage of industrial development.
I feel nothing, Geordi. It is my belief that with my memory engrams he will be able to function as a more complete individual.
No.
Really, Captain, it was a lovely toast.
May I have this dance?
Counselor.
It's about Data  I've watched him with the B-9 and I'm troubled. Data's desire for a "family" is very strong. I'm afraid he may be investing too much in the B-9.
He can never know you as I know you... He can never touch you as I touch you.
I'll always be with you now. Now and forever.
You're not here.
I'm afraid that drink will have to wait, Captain.

It's very faint but I've isolated it to the third planet in the Kolarin system.
It's called a Cascading Bio- genic Pulse. The unique properties of Thalaron radiation allow the energy beam to expand almost without limits. Depending on the radiant intensity it could encompass a ship... or a planet.
So, human... you've met your better self!
It would take me but an instant to tear that valiant heart from your chest.
I'm picking up an unusual electromagnetic signature from the Kolarin system.
To find the head, sir?
Sir --
Captain, you have an Alpha Priority communication from Starfleet Command.
Why don't they answer our hails?
Strength in numbers?
But she's not the Enterprise.
Serving with you has been an honor.
No one knew what to do. Finally I was taken to a doctor who had some experience with Terran illnesses and I was finally diagnosed with Shalaft's syndrome. Do you know of it, Captain?
Romulan ale -- I'm surprised. I can't stand it.
It's not quite the face you remember.
I want to know  where I come from. The Remans gave me a future. You can tell me about my past.
Shinzon... I'm trying to believe you.
If there's one ideal the Federation holds most dear it's that all men, all races, can be united. From the first time the Vulcans came to Earth we've sought a future of peace. Nothing would make me more proud than to take your hand in friend- ship. In time. When trust has been earned.
All of this so you could capture me?
I have little interest in your quaint vessel, Captain. If the Enterprise will withdraw to a distance of one hundred light years, it will not be harmed.
I know you as well as I know myself, Shinzon. There was a time you looked at the stars and dreamed of what might be.
Not so long.
The man who is Jean Luc Picard and Shinzon of Remus won't exterminate the population of an entire planet! He is better than that!
Report!
Well, that sounds relaxing too.
Believe it or not, I think the cavalry has arrived.
Don't forget our mission, Shinzon. We should act. Now. Time is running out.
What is it?!! Focus on your job!!
And bringing the Enterprise here?! What possible purpose could that serve?
You must learn patience, Commander. Do you know where I learned it? In the dilithium mines of Remus. Spend eighteen hours every day under the ash of a Romulan guard’s whip and you'll soon understand patience.
The Enterprise is immaterial! They won't make it back to Federation space.
Benny, God, take it easy...
Don't you think you should call a backup?
You have one with two beds?
Make any money?
What was your last stop?
Where's that?
Recognize this?
It's real, George.
Don't let them do it this way, George. It's too important. We can't find this thing alone.
You sure you want this, because... that's putting an awful lot of faith in people we have no control over...
We're growing very concerned back here. There's no use pretending otherwise. We're rapidly approaching a 'condition red.' People are beginning to ask difficult questions.
I'm not being unpatriotic, and I'm doing my damndest to catch them. Bell's up on 80 and I'm down here on 70 past Grand Junction. They're heading west. If they're not flying we have a damn good chance of getting them. All I'm asking is that you people think about it.
We don't have to do it that way. We can catch him this time.
You can change a directive, George. You've done it before. Listen to me. He's going somewhere in Death Valley. Lathrop Wells was never anything but a bus stop. East is the nuclear site. There are no roads in there. She was teaching him to hitchhike. I'm telling you. We block the four roads into Death Valley and we got him.
That's the chance we have to take.
If I don't speak to Mr. Shermin, I'm hanging up.
Is the man who kidnapped you there now?
Steering wheel...
Gear shift.
What?
Why are you going here? What is here?
How many days and nights do you have to go...  ...here?
That's not much time. I'll just slow you down. I have to sleep. I'm very tired. And I have to wash and eat. You don't...
I won't tell anybody if that's what you're worried about. I promise. You'll keep...
No... The closest...
Say it.
Why did your ship land on this planet... on Earth?
You did? That's funny. So did we.
The police shouldn't have started shooting. But you can hardly blame them. You surprised them. They didn't know you were up there. When they saw you, they thought you were here to hurt us.
I like this music.
I'd like to hear it. Can you sing something?
You liked my singing?
I will go. But not you.
No one's traveling in this weather.
I will. I will. We still have another day.
Why don't you send one of your radio balloons and tell your captain that you might be late?
It'll give you the different countries, how they came to be, what they are now, how America came to be, the governments, the languages... everything.
This is yours...
Help me!!
Jesus Christ!! You crazy people...
Oh God, man... don't shoot me... My mistake... I'm sorry...
Slow down, slow down.
You get that, Lyman?
I'm telling you they're probably friendly.
After I called in, I had a chance to sit down with the three locals. They swear there's another one that didn't make the ship... It might be alive.
To the same woman?
Nothing up there... The grass is matted down in a few places, but that could have been anything.
I don't understand.
Good job, neither do I. What do you do for a living?
I told you...
Because I'm the one who called the police, you know.
We can't let you do that.
I already got a real one.  Come on, it won't be too bad.  It's not personal.
He's no concern of mine, as long as you don't talk to him.  Don't talk to anybody.  You understand?  Not with everything that's going on right now.
Jesus.
I don't think that's a good idea, Lenny.
Faith, call me, okay?
That's a good one, coming from you.
You don't know what you're fucking with here.
No.
Just what I've read.  That the technology was developed for the Feds, to replace the body wire.  And now it's gone black market.  So, uh, do I get the deck from you?
What kind of things exactly?
Talk to me about costs, here.
Come on, amigo, the world's full of marks.  And nobody knows how to work 'em like you do, pal.  You could sell a goddamn rat's asshole for a wedding ring!  Let me buy you a drink.
See, if you packed your piece you could've made the guy see sense.
You alright?  Y'okay?
Top ten.
2-2-0-3.  Got it.  Stay on her.
Was I a really busy guy?  Did I do Tick too?
So there never was a death squad.
Yeah, but how'd it get to you?
Give me six at least.  This's a good clip, here.  Gets you pumpin'.
I don't know, man, she wouldn't let me see it.  Said I wouldn't want to see it.  She said she was going to give it to you to hold for her. Like insurance or somethin'
Nero.
Greetings, gents.  So let's hear this week's sad story.
Thanks for giving me a ride.  I just have a few stops, mostly on the west side--
Jeez, you're pathetic.  Okay, I got a pickup at the St. James.  I'll take you there, you can get a cab.
Buncha techno-perv jerkoffs.
I need my case.  It's still in the back.
That would be no.
So am I.  Just trying to get by.
I know you wouldn't be saying all this if you didn't care about me. Thanks, Mace.  Really.
Forget her.
What's that?  Present from Faith?
Blackjack?  I don't understand--
And gives it to you.
No more, Lenny.
See, it's all about what they see walking in.  A dead hooker, handcuffs, penetration... they'll see a trick gone wrong.  Random kill.  The kind you never solve.
She said "If they get me".  They. Which means the whole sex-killer thing is a cover, which means somebody whacked her for a reason.
I'm sorry about getting on your case earlier.  I just see you getting sucked in deeper and deeper, and I -- anyway.  I'm sorry.
This is bad.
Are you out of your fucking mind?!
I've got a good idea, yeah.
Who's Strickland?
I worked Vice, Narcotics... Violent Crimes... and I saw every known depravity.  I was lost, Mace.  In outer darkness.  Then I busted this strung-out little teeny-hooker. When I met Faith she was just another runaway giving twenty dollar blowjobs to buy crank.  Another lost soul.
Got your ticket?
You see Tran?
Well...  Get going.  You're still bleeding.
So you're saying we just pretend is didn't happen?  It happened!  The LAPD executed one of the most important black men in America!  Who the fuck are you to bury this?!
Yeah, well maybe it's time for a war!
Testa?
Agents Duncan, Mackelway.  Anything new?
Anybody talk to the press?
What does the Manager say?
The room key's in the car. On the seat.
Dylan here.
The body was embalmed. I don't understand --
A grill pattern.
You can't imagine how many men have told me that.
Look...
The man who was with him, he was a construction worker?
Speck's the killer all right. We got box loads of evidence. Did 'em all the same way: torture, strangulation. Prostitutes. I don't think we'll be able to write off any outstandings on him -- this is probably the full body count.
Nada. Vague description, that's all. Fine-tooth-combed Speck's car, the diner: no fingerprints, no trace evidence.
Deputy Director, get out, sir.
Mackelway, I could understand. He is over-emotional by nature, but you, Agent Kulok, you had a shining career in front of you.
I think I talked to him.
I might point out, Agent Mackelway, the reason we haven't been able to crack those rooms is that you refused to share that information with us -- which is also why you were reassigned.
Its called insubordination.
How do you feel, Agent
I'm told you've asked for a Bureau cross-check of flight records to and from El Paso, Ft. Myers, Omaha, the Murman murder time frames.
That breaks my confidentiality stipulation.
Watch out for Dick Low, he's a liar; he has his own world. There was a Junior Agent in Seattle, not unlike you, an Agent who fell under Dick's spell. He'd have done anything for Agent Low. Richard got this Agent to take a suspect to the crime scene, beat him up, force a confession -- all unauthorized, all illegal.  The Agent died that night, killed by the suspect. Richard Low got him killed. Worst of all, we had to hush it up, let the suspect go. The suspect was George Sheldon, the second man Richard killed.
Hawkins isn't the target, Richard Low's the target.
Miss me, Dave?
Thanks for the ride.
None taken.
Yes I do.
Relax.  J. Edgar's greatest fear: a female with a badge.
People end up in occupations for a reason. They may think not, but they do: occupations define us.
Take it to the next level. What are his fantasies, what turns him on, what kind of pornography does he like? If he could act out his fantasies, what would he do? Imagine yourself one of his victims, realizing your life is in his hands. What is he thinking?
I've been thinking about this.
Then there's the other issue.
Hello?
My watch. He toyed with me. He sent me to Chicago.
Start killing people for real?
That's a crackpot theory. Everybody says so.
Tom, you okay?
It's quite advanced.
Unlock these cuffs.
How did you know Speck was a killer?
Dave Koessler must have you jumping through hoops.
I don't carry it with me.
Hum a tune and I'll sing to it.
Of course not. They're possibles. I've checked them against Bureau records, check them against your file. How did you get it?
If you won't do it for me, do it for your cousin, Nadine, right? The girl in the pink sweater.
This guy, Zero, he drifts around, that's how they all start, drifting around, their minds filling up with fantasies. He thinks he's real smart, laughs at us, laughs at his victims. But he has left a trail, and the trail is somewhere in those names. You know how to reach me.  Take my advice, when dealing with these FBI tight-asses, go by the book. That's what I did.
Is he dead?
[You want to talk, Lionheart, or you want to take this a little more personal?]
I've been to Chicago.
I've located the Suspect Zero file. Did you know there was one? Koessler ordered it as part of your evaluation.
Not everything is imputed to memory. The most confidential stuff is kept top secret hard copy. Why would the Zero file be kept secret?
Yes, sir.
Agent Mackelway, you want to get off your ass and do something for a change?
Headed there now. The same shift will be on at noon.
No.
But why attack an Agent?
I don't think you understand.
Don't do it, Mike.
Do you realize that I've been waiting for that call for six months and I cut her off?
You like laughing at the misery of others?
...Monday nights? I host an open mike...
I'm Mike.
How?
You don't think the guy would find me attractive enough to dance with?
Charles! What's up, man?
...and boy does it hurt when they ask.
You want to come with us to a party at the Chateau Marmont? They got a bungalow and lots of beautiful babies.
Hi.
I'm considering taking a job as a "Goofy".
I know what you're saying, man. I don't know what to tell you...
It's like, you looked at my tape. You saw my picture. Why did you call me in? You knew I was twenty-four.
Oh my God.
The poor thing. Six years?
You're not allowed to hand me money, sir. You'll have to lay it on the table if you want me to change it.
Who's your booking agent?
Neither is acting. Not if you're serious about it.  Can I have one of these?
Can I give you a ride to your car...?
...Which one...?
Yeah.
I couldn't. Do you know how hard it's been not to call you? I pick up the phone every night. Whenever that commercial comes on...
Yeah, uh, I don't think that's gonna be happening any time soon... Listen, can I call you right back? I gotta take this call...
Thanks, man. Sorry we always talk about the same thing all the time...
Rob, I just want you to know, you're the only one I can talk to about her.
Why?
I'll get a Dewars rocks... 
I can't get over how cute the girls in this city are.
It's like, every day I see a beautiful woman. I'm not used to that. I'm used to seeing a beautiful woman, I don't know, once a week. I can't handle it.
I can't wait till I actually get to touch one of them.
What's that guy's name? Sue?
I got to at least try once.
Sorry about what happened at the Dresden. I had no idea...
You want to talk about it?
Then why won't she call...?
How did you get over it? I mean how long 'til it stopped hurting?
You miss the pain?
By the way, the guys back home said she put on some weight.
...How can you compare them? Tarantino totally bites everything from Scorsese...
Big butt... you know, can't fly coach.
I'm so sorry, man. You were so right. I got rid of the gun
Thanks, man.  I've been hating myself for the last two days.
Good for you, man. He's being smart.
There you two are. I walked around for an hour with that stupid martini on my tray.
Are you ready to order?
That's right.
Listen to you. I got an audition for a pilot at nine and I'm going. You gotta get out with some beautiful babies. You can't sit home thinking about her.
Wait.
No, seriously, if you're dressed nice and you act like you gamble a lot, they give you free shit.
Pirates of the fucking Caribbean.
This place is dead. I thought this was the city that never sleeps.
Tee, the beautiful babies don't work Wednesdays midnight to six. This is the skank shift.
You gotta do it.
Always, baby.
Hey, man, I'm down too, you know.
What are you, nuts? You think she's coming back?
I don't think so.
...and then I'm struggling to impress some chick who's not half as classy as my girlfriend, who I'm not even really attracted to...
Baby, you did fine.
...Baby...
You did fine. Don't sweat her. We're meeting our honeys soon. You know Christy's friend is going to be money.
Whatever.
What was the part?
Wait...  She's crying. I finish. I hold up my finger like "Wait a second". They sit in silence for, like, at least five minutes. I look up and they all start clapping, and now they're all crying. Even the camera guy.
No, man. I need to use the phone.
She asked me what I was thinking about? What should I have done? Lie?
Sorry about interrupting...
I don't think so.
I just don't think she liked me in that way.
I was younger... It was college. You didn't go to college, you don't know what it's like. You screw chicks you have no business being with. They're young, they don't know any better.
No. Doesn't that suck?
How you guys doing?
What are you doing?
I'm sorry.
Why, baby? What'd I do wrong?
She didn't see.
Please, don't mess with me right now...
Tomorrow?
So, two days?
Guys... Guys... I got it under control.
Because he's a bitch.
...against the computer.
Is he cute? Ask him if he wants to stay for a cocktail!
Baby, don't talk that way, baby...
...we're not...
...Tomorrow, then a day.
Laugh all you want, but if you call to soon you can scare off a nice baby who's ready to party.
...Shut up, Sue...
It is on.
Sorry man.
...One fifty-nine, Two minutes.
Yes, I understand.  I'm listening.
The Don himself is coming to me tonight?
Be my friend.
Understood.  I just wish I was doing more to help out.
Godfather!
You filthy guinea spoiled brat. Clean it up or I'll kick your head in.
Mostly it gives witnesses an excuse to change their identification when we make them see the light.  Then you take a long vacation and we catch the hell.
I tol' you to stay put, Paulie...
Outside.
Thirty per cent.  In the first year your share would be four million dollars; then it would go up.
No...how a man makes his living is none of my business.  But this proposition of yours is too risky. All the people in my family lived well the last ten years, I won't risk that out of greed.
No.
I kept trying to call you after my divorce and Tom always said you were busy.  When I got the Wedding invitation I knew you weren't sore at me anymore, Godfather.
My wife was weeping before she fell asleep, outside my window I saw my caporegimes to the house, and it is midnight.  So, Consigliere of mine, I think you should tell your Don what everyone knows.
You mean Tattaglia.
Accept what's happened, Michael.
I told you that it wouldn't escape his eye.
Godfather, you understand everything.
Corleone.
Is that why there are more men on the walls?
You tell us about America.
We hear.  We were told you were a Pezzonovanta...big shot.
You had better bring a few bottles home with you, my friend; you'll need help sleeping tonight. 
Beautiful all over, eh?
Who are those girls?
Mike, you sure about Moe selling. He never mentioned it to me and he loves the business.
We'll let the old man take it easy for a couple of weeks.  I want to get things going good before he gets better.  What's the matter with you?
No more stalemate Tom, we got the soldiers, we'll match them gun for gun if that's how they want it. They know me for what I am, Tom-- and they're scared of me.
What was that?
Sonny was hot for my deal, right? You know it's the smart thing to do, too.  I want you to talk Sonny into it.
I'll worry about Luca.  You take care of Sonny and the other two kids.
He never asks a second favor when he has been refused the first. Understood?
I'm German-Irish.
Christ, Tom; I needed more time with him.  I really needed him.
I've never seen anything like it.
Once upon a time, about fifteen years ago some people wanted to take over my father's olive oil business.  They had Al Capone send some men in from Chicago to kill my father, and they almost did.
Then the legs at the knees...
I used to come down to New York whenever he sang at the Capitol and scream my head off.
Michael.
Michael, what are you doing?
Michael?
He'll be OK.
Visiting hour ends at eight thirty. I'll just sit with him; I want to show respect.
When will I see you again?
Michael, it's not true.  Please tell me.
You cannot stay here...I'm sorry.
Oh no you can't, the old man'd be sore as hell if I let you get mixed up in this.
All right, Mikey...who do we have to hit, Clemenza or Paulie?
Clemenza?  No, I don't believe it.
All right, Sonny.  All right.
Where are you going?
Mikey, you look beautiful!
Go on Mike.
Why don't you stop living like a bum and get this place cleaned up.
O.K.  How long do you think before I can come back?
Do you pledge to guide and protect this child if he is left fatherless? Do you promise to shield him against the wickedness of the world?
You goddamn dagos.  I do you a favor and take Freddie in when you're having a bad time, and then you try to push me out.
Sorry, sorry, sorry. I know, I'm late, I'm a swine.
Okay, we're going to Naples. There's a club, it's not a club, it's a cellar.
You'd say if you mind?
I hope it wasn't cheap.
Dubious but special honor, Tom -- crewing Dickie's boat. Alright, bar's open.
Okay.  And did we know each other?
I'm intruding.
You're a dark horse, Ripley. Engaged?
I have to go to Venice.
I love the fact you brought Shakespeare with you and no clothes. Ermelinda says you wash the same shirt out every night. Is that true?
Means we never shared a bath. I'm cold. Can I get in?
You've got to get a new jacket. Really. You must be sick of the same clothes. I'm sick of seeing you in them.
It's just there's so much to do in a single day.
Get undressed in your own room, would you?
What about Venice? Can we stick to that plan at least?
To Mongibello and the happiest days of my life.
Why are you asking all of a sudden?
Why?
Ha.
I wanted to tell you my plan.
I thought I might come back. In the New Year. Under my own steam.
How?
No, no, it's not a threat, I've explained all of that.
Come on, Frederico, do you really have to go back? At least stick around for the Festival of the Madonna.
Who is it?
Yes, I'm good, thank you. Dickies at dinner. He's at Otello's. Do you know it?
Of course, he's been very involved in his music, hasn't he? I think his theory is, you know, you have to go into a cocoon before you can become a butterfly.
You should watch that!
No, Marge doesn't know the half of it.
Pretty good. Sticking with hot water.
You were right about the telephones. There are no lines, there's some problem.
Dickie, you can't even drive a car! No, what we need urgently is an icebox. What do you think, Tom? Agree with me and I'll be your friend for life.
How are you? Sorry. Is your book going well?
Is he here? Are you with Dickie?
Dickie was at the Opera last night.
He was there with someone. So I suppose she must have dragged him -- that's not fair. I'm going back to Mongi. I think Dickie's coming home.  I'm going to go home.
Tell me the truth. Did he kill Freddie?
Hello Peter, so good to see you.
I was looking forward to seeing him.
Did Dickie's Dad go?
Tom?
I don't know. Peter has a concert in Athens next month -- and he's asked if I want to go along, help out. He says goodbye by the way -- he's in rehearsal, otherwise --
Dickie? Do you know Dickie?
So now, did they put your suitcase in the wrong pile? It's just -- upstairs -- weren't you under the R stand? I thought I saw you there.
Which is?
The funny thing is, I'm not Randall either. I'm Logue.
But you're going skiing with us Yankees, aren't you?
Show me the other one again.  I like them both.
C'mon, I need to talk to you. Just the two of us.
You're kidding.
Ho assunto io la guida delle indagini in seguito alla negativa valutazione delle disdicevoli circostanze verificatesi con il mio predecessore Roverini che come e noto non e riuscito a impedire il verificarsi della scomparsa del signor Greenleaf, il quale era l'unica persona al momento passibile di incriminazione del reato di omicidio del signor Miles.
All'aperto? Col freddo che ha fatto?
Yes, what happened? I heard you were desperate to come. I was looking forward to rowing you around.
Will we see you later?
And tomorrow?
I know the Piazza di Spagna. What time?
We'll be there.
Peter, I'm really sorry to put you through this. I just couldn't face going to the police by myself when my Italian's so rotten.
What rumour?
In Rome, about three weeks ago.  I knew that one.
Tom. Tom! Tell me, what's going on?
You go. I don't want to get dressed yet. Come back though. Come back.  You know, you look so relaxed, like a completely different person.
Was it? Did you speak to Tom?
Thank you.
How much for everything.
Well, then, what is it you exactly want to do?
Why?
Travis, I never ever met anybody like you before.
So why did you decide to drive a taxi at night?
What kind of people?
Com'on, Travis. It's not that bad. I take lots of taxis.
Huh?
What hours do you work?
You know what you remind me of?
But this is a porno movie.
Damn.
...there's plenty of movies around here. I haven't seen any of them, but I'm sure they're good.
Huh?
Tom, come here a moment.  I think this canvas report is about ready to go out. Check it out with Andy, and if he okays if, have a copy made for the campaign headquarters in every county.  And don't forget to add the new photo releases.
Have you ever wondered why CBS News has the highest ratings?
Just what?
Maybe if you'd try thinking once in a while, you'd get somewhere.
No, stupid. With the stubs. That's the whole point.
No, I don't think so.  That's someone else.
No, no, it's alright. I'll have a big Coca-Cola -- without ice -- and a large buttered popcorn, and...  ...some of them chocolate covered malted milk balls... and ju-jukes, a box. They last.
That's fine.
Yeah, that's Blush-On. My wife uses it,
She stayed in the cab, what's she gonna do? But she stiffed me. A real skunk.
For a fee.
Some fleet driver for Bell just got cut up. Just heard it on the radio.
Listen...
Do you understand why I came here?
But that one night?
Who's a killer?
What makes you so high and mighty? Did you ever look at your own eyeballs in a mirror. You don't get eyes like that from...
Why don't you come to a commune with me?
Why?
Just leave'em. There's plenty of other girls.
Sport never treated me bad, honest. Never beat me up once.
You don't have to.
Then it's a good guess it's grounded.
I'm sure you'll win, sir. Everybody I know is going to vote for you.  I was going to put one of your stickers on my taxi but the company said it was against their policy.
There must be something...
So whatja do now?
Sorry, sir. I didn't mean that.
So I hear.
Is that so?
I saw. $20 fifteen minutes. $30 half hour.
I'm hip.
Wha -- ?
Wiz?
Real down.
Had a close one.
Could we change the subject?
I.don't get it.  You're going to help me?
Wait.
I believe you.
You'll be fine.  No matter what Leo Kubelsky says, you've got a hundred and seventy-five years of American law on your side.  Don't forget that.
Not exactly light reading, I know. Believe it or not, I've read this since high school, and it got me all the way through law school. Besides, there's something in there that'll help you.  You won't have to get very far, it's near the beginning.
I think  it's worse  now.
Of course, there was a lot more room before they stuck the memorial down here.
Right here.  "Albert Lucas Trumbo." And all the others.  I knew them all.  So did you.  We went to school with most of them.
So, you're really gonna be a lawyer?
Whoa.
We were in love... weren't we?
Were we going to get married?
Well, there's got to be a way...
They're not bad.
How do you tell those two apart, anyway?
Your dancing's very good.
Now, I see that you've been running a movie theater in Lawson called "The Bijou," is that also true?
Sir, are you referring to the fact that I was suffering from amnesia, and I've since recovered my memory?
Are you refuting this evidence and your previous testimony?
Yet you're contradicting yourself. You earlier testified that you attended a meeting of a communist party-run organization, yet you just said, under oath, that you were not now -- nor ever -- a member of the communist party.
I'm a little hesitant to say.
No wallet, huh?
And... what's my name again?
We've been closed for a while.
Didn't you have any help?
That's Lily.  Your mother, rest her soul.
I promised him a new uniform when we re-opened.  And you'll get one, too.
Um... Harry?  Did I ever keep the books here?
But I...
Ernie.
And you have sixty-eight dollars and thirty-seven cents in the bank. Your only source of income are my veteran's death benefit of forty dollars a month, to which you're no longer entitled since I'm alive, and these ten dollar a month cash deposits you make.  What are those?
Why don't you two get out there and dance?
Well, son, I wish I could've shown you more, but this is all that's left.  Just this one reel that never got sent back from a picture we showed here a long time ago. Nineteen twenty-five, to be exact...
Thanks, Jerry.  Tell me something.
Nope.  Can't.  We're through.
Do you remember if you were driving a car?  Maybe you went over the bridge.  No guard rail there, it's easy to do.  It's happened before.
You think he's drunk somewhere?
Peter, their hands are tied.  You see that, don't you?
So, you're saying that it's true. You went to a meeting of a known communist organization.
Fought?  Come on, Pete, you ran the PX at Fort Dix.
I know.  A Purple Heart.
However... you're gonna be subpoenaed to testify before the Un-American Activities Committee when they open hearings in Los Angeles.  Now, if you play ball and tell them what they want to hear, they'll clear you.
Exactly.
Oh, I see.  But you're not Luke. You're Peter Appleton, the picture writer.
Why not?
Not at all.
I haven't danced with another man since Mr. Terwilliger passed.
Luke!  Luke, something's wrong! The film broke, and I can't raise Harry on the house phone!
Is there a young Tim?
Can I... Can I t-t-talk to you?
Please, sit.
Tim, I have to tell you something.
Pete, there's time before the picture starts, you want to get some popcorn?
What happened?
Ancestors?
They all know you?
Who?
Do I?  No, I'm an open book, I'm afraid.  Or maybe a closed one.  Pretty. What are they?
Mmm.  Well, good luck, Miss Daniels.
No, thank you.  Won't you call me Melanie?
Isn't there?  Maybe there isn't. Maybe there's never anything between Mitch and any girl.
Four years ago. Of course, that was shortly after his father died.  Things may be different now.
And what had you done?
Afraid you'd take Mitch?
I don't understand.
What about Mitch? Didn't he have anything to say about this?
I did.
He wants me to go to Cathy's party tomorrow afternoon.  I said I would.
Yes.
Yes, I did.
Mitch, can I bring the lovebirds in here?
Miss Daniels?
Is smoking fun?
Oh. Where d'you want the coffee?
Cathy! Get a blanket and some bandages!
And the white house?
The Brenners? Mr. and Mrs. Brenner?
I see. How do I get down there?
I didn't want to come right down the road, where they could see me.
How much for the phone calls?
Young woman cut herself.
I thought I saw your car. What are you doing in town?
Across at Brinkmeyer's.
Lovebirds, I see.
He sold the feed to me, didn't he?
She is the one who jumped into that fountain in Rome last summer, isn't she?
It's none of my business, of course, but when you bring a girl like that to...
Well... well, is everyone all right?
When?
Where's Mitch?
Yes, I think so. My son is important to me. I want to like any girl he chooses.
I couldn't ask you to.
Please don't mess me up with bandages, Mrs. Brenner.
That's a chimney swift, all right.
My wife found a bird in the back seat of her car once.
Oh, yeah, yeah.  How old is she now?
He's not home.
Yes, what was it you were looking for, sir?
Lovebirds, sir?
I think so, sir.  Now then, let me see.
Well, we can't just let them fly around the shop, you know.
What did you say?
So you're a lawyer.
What kind of law?
Yes.
Just a few... just a day or two... the weekend.
I don't know. But it seems to me you must have gone to a lot of trouble to find out who I was, and where I lived and...
But you were coming up anyway, remember?
Right next to the one you already had.
Yes, but...
Certainly, but...
With... with Annie, of course.
Annie... Annie may have made other plans. I'll have to see. Besides, I can find my own way.
Hi. Annie had no plans, huh? I'm glad you came. Are you hungry?
You'll be able to find your way back, won't you?
You were lying.
What did it say?
I really shouldn't have any more. I'm a little tipsy already.
On Mondays and Wednesdays, I work for the Travelers' Aid. At the airport.
And on Tuesdays, I take a course in General Semantics at Berkeley.  That's not a job, of course. I just take it because...
Nothing.  I go to bird shops on Fridays.
Do you want some mustard with this?
What do you mean?
I got here as fast as I could. Where's Cathy?
How long have they been gathering there?
Where are they heading?
When will they stop?
What time is it?
You must be exhausted.
You'd have been safe in San Francisco.
Can we turn back?
Hello, Mrs. MacGruder, have you ever seen so many gulls?
I was hoping you'd be a little late, Miss Daniels.  You see, he hasn't arrived yet.
I know. Oh, I know.  I've been calling all morning. Oh, you have no idea. Miss Daniels, they're so difficult to get, really they are. We get them from India, you know, when they're just little chicks, and then we have to...
There we are!
That... that... who was that?
They said the myna bird would be here later this afternoon. If you'd care to come back...
Well... well, how soon would you want them?
The gulls were after your fish, Mr. Sholes. Really, let's be logical about this.
What do you think they were after, Miss...?
Maybe they're all protecting the species. Maybe they're tired of being shot at and roasted in ovens and...
Sebastian, I'm not an alarmist.
How can we go on living here if we blanket the town with smoke?
We need them.
Kill them all. Get rid of them. Messy animals.
The ones that've been raising the devil with my fishing boats.
Something like this happened in Santa Cruz last year. The town was covered with seagulls.
Mr. Gray?
-- pain -- and shock.  She's brave enough, but I don't know about myself.  Now that it seems so close, I wonder if I dare trust my child into any but God's hands. Maybe He knows best.
You must leave this house.
That porter was Gray and the gentleman of consequence who couldn't swallow the shame of it -- who took my last paltry savings to hire Gray --
But, Doctor, I only wanted to speak to you --
Dr. MacFarlane --
I'm afraid I have to, sir.  You see, my father is vicar at Thrums -- it's a small parish -- not much of a living --
I don't think I can go on, sir.
It was about last night I wanted to talk to you -- about the operation on the little Marsh girl.
But you did promise.
Here is where you must watch closely, gentleman -- closely -- it is the very heart of the matter --
I suppose one must pass through this purgatory to the heaven of being a good doctor.
What do you mean, Fettes?
I pass up no opportunities, I've a whole course of lectures in mind for you fellows.  We'll need subjects to demonstrate. Come along.
What you really want to ask me is about my back, isn't it -- about where it hurts?
Why do you want the white horse to bid you "good-day"?
Don't you want to find the white horse, Georgina?  You can't find him from a wheelchair.  You have to walk and run to find him.
Come, Toddy -- come.  Sit down here with me.
Mr. Fettes and I have professional matters to discuss.
Afraid you are not as good a doctor perhaps as you make out to be.
You?  Why?  Since when have you become the protector of little children?
You know what you want and don't want -- so that's an end of business between us -- but we'll still be friends, Toddy.  I'll be dropping by to see you and Meg once in a while -- for auld lang syne, you know.
I am a doctor - a good doctor. I could make her walk, but she won't - she won't --
Why should I be afraid of you? What are you holding over me?
This is a gift.
I would make you rich.
A pleasure to torment me?
You and I should work together.
"The ruffian dogs, the Hellish pair.  The villain Burke, the meager Hare --"
Any attacks of pain since?
Is her pain sporadic or constant?
I regret it, Ma'am, but I have the responsibility of training thirty other doctors to attend a thousand children like your own.
You think it'll spoil the boy, eh? Was I not assistant to Knox?
You're not going to Gray.
Can I get you something? A glass of water? A transfusion?
Leonard, Dutton, Erlich. They don't matter. I want the King.
Fuck! What do you want?
Not my arm! What you fucking want?
Are you out of your fucking mind? We're going to die.
You killed that cop Dutton.
From the bonfire over there. Look at it.
Erin. It's not your fault.
You know what Lauren and I were fighting about that night? She had a secret, wouldn't tell me...
In the woods you said you had nothing. But you wouldn't, and I wouldn't if there's some way you don't have to go. Please. At least not right away.
Tommy Leonard. The eyewitness in the Corvis case.
They botched the execution.
I watched her grow up. Just like you. I know how her mind worked. She kept snooping around because she was worried about you. What you'd gotten yourself into. So stop blaming me. And blame yourself.
What's with your friend there?
But you, you've had them.
What were you yelling about?
Honey. It's doesn't mean anything. It's not a message.
It still doesn't mean...
Stay away from me! Stay away!
The whole city has stopped. People are running around like ants!
What about the people who are coming to the meeting tonight? Have they all arrived?
Good. Did you speak to our friend Mr. Carpenter?
As though unsure of what he's heard) Yes -- yes, I have.
You have faith, Professor Barnhardt
What -- what sort of action do you mean?
Would you be willing to meet with the group of scientists I am calling together?. Perhaps you could explain your mission to them, and they in turn could present it to their various peoples.
It is not enough to have men of science. We scientists are too easily ignored -- or misunderstood. We must get important men from every field. Educators -- philosophers -- church leaders -- men of vision and imagination -- the finest minds in the world.
The people who came to the meeting must be made to realize this. They must understand what is at stake.  You mentioned a demonstration of force--
Something that would dramatize for them and for their people the seriousness of the situation. Something that would affect the entire planet.
Maybe a little demonstration.
Bobby -- I think it would be better if we didn't see quite so much of Mr. Carpenter
Tell me what?
Oh, boy -- can I, Mom?
Well -- Professor Barnhardt, I guess. He's the greatest scientist in the world.
Sure. Right near where my mother works.
Wouldn't you like to meet him?
Did all these people die in wars?
No foolin'? Will you?
I've got some money. My mother gave me two dollars.
Mrs. Benson -- this is Mr. Brady.
The President asked me to convey his deepest apologies for what has happened. We all feel--
I'm sure you recognize from our broad- casts the evil forces that have produced the tension in our world. Surely you would agree--
Our problems are very complex, Mr. Klaatu. You mustn't judge us too harshly.
You're a good salesman -- but I've got to think about it.
I will be in just a minute.
Helen, he's the man from the space ship!  I had that diamond checked at three different places. Nobody on earth's ever seen a stone like that! After what Bobby told us, that's enough for me. Why is it nobody knows anything about him? Why hasn't he got any money?
Important? Of course it's important. The point is we can do something about it.
He's a menace to the whole world! It's our duty to turn him in.
Bobby's the only person I know who isn't -- Jittery.
Where are you going now?
I was.
Is it worth anything?
I suppose you know that Barnhardt does a lot of secret work for the Army.
Your name's Carpenter -- that right?  Any identification, Mr. Carpenter? Driver's license -- social security number?
We're fighters for Truth, Justice, and the American Way.
We've been aware of some very serious vampire activity in this town for a long time.
Okay.  Where's Nosferatu?
Did you see that sucker burn?!
Two down and two to go.
Death to all vampires!
We still going?
We were gonna grab some food.
So how do you like those maggots, Michael?
I'm my own man.
And these Archies should be over here with the Richie Rich's.
Bad breath?  Long fingernails?
I have something to tell you guys.  Not only is my own brother showing systems of being a vampire... but now I'm convinced my mother's <u>dating</u> one!
I wish they were vampires so I could nuke them in their hearts.
David.
Lucy, you're the only woman I ever knew didn't improve her situation by getting divorced.
Ouch, my hair...
I can't sleep with the closet door open, either.  Not even a crack.  Your father doesn't mind, though. It could be wide open for all he cared.  I think one of the reasons I divorced him was because he never believed... in the horror... of the <u>closet monster</u>!
Max?  You men we're having company again?
Still mad at me?
It's early.  Why do we have to go home?
See you later.
Michael, are you still in bed?
We are...
Tell them to get something to eat.
When you ran away from home, hitch- hiked to Berkeley, spent the night in Golden Gate Park and begged for spare change in the morning?
What's wrong?  Tell me.
Sam!  What happened!?  You had me scared to death.  Are you all right?
Do you mind?  It was a real scary comic.
You're cute, Max.
This looks terrific, Lucy.
I don't understand Sam.  He's just not like this.
Something the matter?
Hi...
I'm Michael.
When?
Do you know where David took me tonight, Star?  Do you?!
Why not?
Then it's not too late for us...
What!?  He <u>can</u> and I <u>can't</u>?!  No fair!!
This is kind of a cool place.
Mom, you hitched all the way to Berkeley once, remember?
What about Nonook?  What have you done to Nanook?!  What have you done to my dog, you asshole?!
Pretty nasty out, Mac.  Thirty-five knots.
All right... Box of dynamite... box of thermite... three shotguns... box of flares... two flare guns... thirty cans gasoline... and a case of alcohol.
Where these tracks headed?
What was he doing in the rec room?
What the hell you looking at me like that for?
What you doin'?
... Can't you see...?  If one cell of this Thing got out it could imitate every living thing on Earth. Nothing could stop it!  Nothing!
Know what you mean, Blair.  Trust is a tough thing to come by these days. Just trust in the Lord.
Childs, where's that magneto from Chopper One?
What?
Don't get near 'em.  The plants! They're alive.  Those things can imitate anything...
We got to burn 'em.
Why didn't it imitate Fuchs?  Isn't that its number -- to get more recruits.
He's so close.  Maybe our best chance to blow him away.
I said where?  Where'd you go?!
What's happening?
Torch them!!
Garry's missing!
Well, who says I want you going with me?!
You ain't tying me up.
Spaceship of some kind.
Neither will we.
Screw regulations!  Four guys could be crawling around on their bellies out there!
Hey, Sweden!!!
Yes, there is.  I'd like to go up.
Gotta be from the Norwegian camp.
How many in their party?
Couple seconds of an Argentine disco station.
Looks good.
No it ain't there.  Would I be asking if it were there?
Sanchez, you and Palmer search the inside...
Tie up Clark, too.
You jerking off or just pissed?
What's happened?!
... Made sure I got ahead of him on the towline on the way back... cut him loose.
You hear that?
Now how did you get hurt?
What do you do on the towers?
Kalen... Do you have any idea where they take them?
No one ever comes here.  My mother told me stories about it late at night.  They tell all the children.
But you escaped.
Regenerating fission reactor, you wouldn't understand.  It's power is well beyond your neanderthal cranial capacity.
Send him away.
Send him home.  You don't want him to see it.
Yes... Are you sure you want to do this?
Machines?
Why did they built it?
Vox --
What's your name?
Why?
I could have a hundred Morlocks here in thirty seconds.
But you've earned a reward for your valor.  I think you should become. You'll like it here.  Once you get used to the darkness.
I've only read about them -- and the new internals.
How do you keep the water temperature stable?
Next time then.  We perambulate here most every night.
Well there's something new.
All right, what is it now?
You're late.
Let's walk through the park...
Alex, what is it?
I don't.  I want them to run along this street and knock off every bowler they see.
It wasn't your fault, Alex.
Couldn't help but overhearing.  Two fine young people starting out on the road of life.  I wish you the very best.
Is there a lot of illness?
His curiosity is amazing.
Kalen will tire you out if you let him.  He's always been curious. His father was firm with him but... it's just his way.
I might find the truth rather hard to understand?... Can you go back?
You seem fascinated by the stars.
Don't then have stars where you come from?
Mara, I had a strange dream last night.  I was here, walking through a forest very much like this, and then...
Yes.
All of you?
It has no purpose.  It's just beautiful... Does everything have a purpose where you come from?
Only to keep warm.  For illumination we had gaslights on most of the streets and a new invention called electrical lighting that made it seem like daylight all through the night.
Alexander...?
Yes... a little scorching on the upholstery but otherwise all ship- shape.
Yes... I suppose so.
Alexander, take my son away.  Take him back to your time.  Will you do that?
It was different then.
Sir, that curriculum is forty years out of date.  The students today are looking toward the new century -- they want to be challenged and inspired, not spoon-fed dusty old equations that have been proved a thousand times.  They want to explore.
Yes, sir.
He said he traveled for two months.
What do you mean?!
You won't even try?
I wonder if that poor girl has any idea what she's in for?
You ok?
But... what about Starks?
Should we be...
Don't get all worked up, Justin. I expected some common sense on your part and clearly I was expecting too much. [Beat] Just open the drawer.
Well, your condition's pretty serious.
I don't know better. All I know is that you left me in there.
We are not birds of a feather.
Hello, William. I understand you've been asking for me almost every hour. I would've been here sooner but you gave our little state visitor quite a bit to talk to me about.
Yes.
The three of you weren't regular patients. You were criminals that ended up at Alpine Grove.
Did you know my father?
I thought you said you never knew your father.
He died because he bled to death from a blow to his head. Someone had to have given him it.
What should they be looking for?
Where? [Beat] It's Becker isn't it? He's doing stuff, isn't he?
I need to get this letter to someone.
I'm sorry I can't tell you more about your father's death, Mr. Starks. Our own medical examiners determined only that he died from a blunt trauma to the head but that was right around the time the Alpine Grove's staff changed and I'm afraid we didn't have the best record system before then.
What're those?
What'd you do? Snoop all over the place? You had no right. You had no right to go through anything.
No, I don't have anything to show you. I'm here from a mental hospital.
You can't be William Starks. He's dead.
[Beat] You bled to death.
Do you really believe me?
I have no idea.
What about Captain Medley? He never told them what happened to you over there. His testimony...that coward wanted them to think you were crazy.
You're sure?
Because I don't think I'm crazy.
How'd he get it?
So maybe Dr. Becker would know. [Beat] But, as I'm sure you know, the statute of limitations has run out for charging the hospital with any liabilities.
You'll die if you keep smoking those in your condition.
Why don't you help me?
Some part of you suspects -- even if you don't know for sure -- that what I'm saying is true.
You're going to be ok, William. We just need to get your fever down and we'll be able to hopefully stabilize you.
Can I get some paper and something to write with.
I'm not gonna let that happen.
He's having absence [pronounced "absance"] seizures when he stares off into space like he does. He has them so often that that's why he hasn't learned to speak properly.
I tried to kill my wife.
I know you need one when it's really cold.
Mortality's actually a great thing to be familiar with. It means you're sane on some level.
[Beat] How do you know?
In case you hadn't figured, it's Christmas Eve. You're never gonna get a cab here.
I'm not sure.
No, you won't. You'll die of cold out there and then I'll have to feel guilty. And I've already got more guilt than I know what to do with. [Beat] Do you want something to drink?
Well, good for you.
But hey, who can forget those words? The man just wants simple and good things for his woman -- that she be warm and happy. How hard can that be to remember?
Hon.
Do you think you could ever think of a set of circumstances that would just cause you to haul off and shoot someone?
Yeah, I could too.  But... I don't know why I'm even asking you this. It's just... we can't place anybody at the scene but these two gals that everybody swears is sweet as pie. I don't know.  I keep hearing words -- impossible -- inconceivable.  If just one person would say...
We spoke with a gentlemen today who says he personally delivered very close to that same amount to a Miss Louise Sawyer.  Do you know her too?
Well, you're not exactly an expert witness, but what makes you so sure?
Lena, just cut the bullshit, will ya?  Do have any ideas or don't ya? I been standin' in this stupid parkin' lot all goddamn night, and I still got to go file a report before I can go home in time to get back up again!
Weird.  Got some kind of snowball effect goin' here or somethin'.
I have no problem with that.
Is this the guy you saw them with?
What kind of gun was it?
We're going to leave someone here at the house in the event that she calls in.  Someone will be here until we find them.
It's just not working like this.  We gotta do something.  It'd be one thing if these girls were hardened criminals, but Jesus, Hal, this is makin' us look bad.  I don't know... maybe they're not movin'.  Maybe that little creep lied.
We don't have a whole lotta choice, do we?  I can't figure out if they're real smart or just really, really lucky.
Stop.
So how come you don't have any kids?
Did you get married real young?
This is J.D.  He's a student.  We're just givin' him a ride to... to here.  Louise said we could bring him here and then he'd have to go. And that's what he's doin'.  He's goin'.  Aren't you, J.D.?
Louise, is that you?
That sounds nice.
I always knew that.
I am funny.  I'm real funny.
Something real bad has happened and I can't tell you what, just that it's bad and I did it and I can't undo it.  Can you help me?
You didn't say what it was for, did you?
I'm the one... I never made it work. I just... It's not that I don't love you.  It's not that.  I just never thought I'd be thirty-six years old and I never thought... I don't know what I thought.  What do you want, darlin'.  What do you want me to do.
Are you just doin' this to punish me?
Not this weekend, sweetie, she's runnin' away with me.  Hi.  What'd he say?
I've never had the chance to go out of town without Darryl.
'Cause I didn't ask him.
All of it.  That he tried to rape me.
We're gonna go to the next town and stop.  We'll get a motel room.  I can rest for a while and then figure out how to get some money.  We're gonna need money.  Thelma.  How much money do you have with you?
I'm cash poor.
Oh, I don't know.  I'm just nervous. I gotta figure out what to do.
What do you mean?
You talked to him?!  Is he mad?  Did you tell him?
But you think he fools around.
I... I don't know.  I don't know what you're askin' me.
Louise, this young man is on his way back to school and needs a ride, and I thought since...
So what are you gonna tell him?
What happened to your hair?
Drive!  Drive away!
For the first time in my life, I wish this car wasn't green.
Fill her up.  There's a phone right over there.
That J.D. kid is a little shit.
Louise?  Where are we?
Now what?
Like a Chihuahua?
I mean, look how different he looks just since high school.  It's bad enough I have to get old, but doin' it with Darryl around is only gonna make it worse.  I mean, I don't think he's gonna be very nice about it.
I always wanted to travel.  I just never got the opportunity.
Look!  Look who it is, Thelma.  I'll be darned.  What's he doin' way out here.
What?
I don't want to talk about it! Thelma, I'm not kidding!  Don't you even...
Well, I figure if you take a state policeman, shoot up his car, take his gun and lock him in the trunk, it's best to just get on out of the state if you can.
Shit.  I'm gettin' tired.
I think I've really fucked up.  I think I've got us in a situation where we could both get killed.  Why didn't we just go straight to the police.
You're not gonna give up on me, are ya?
You're not gonna make some deal with that guy, are you?  I mean, I just wanna know.
He said they're charging us with murder.
Me too.  I feel awake.
We should head a little further in. There's not that many roads in this state.  I want to try to hit Mexico somewhere not so close to New Mexico.  They probably wanna kill us in New Mexico.
We've gone insane.
You're a good friend.
What in the hell is that up there?
Are you going to apologize or not?
We're fine!  How are you?
Yeah... sure did.
S'matter with you? You look like you're fading.
Isn't that just my luck -- I get caught for everything.
That's what I want to tell ya. I've been through two years of extensive psychotherapy and you know what? You were right -- I needed help.
Come on, that wouldn't make me gay.
I mean since then.
What if you're wrong? You just said she's the only girl you ever loved, what have you got to lose by calling her?
So that was it? One bump in the road and you gave up?
You're kidding? What did they say?
I don't know about this, Dom.
And you think he could find out her number for me?
Maybe you're right. I should look on the bright side. I mean, I've still got my health...  I'm out of here. I've got to get up at six a.m. to move my boss's brother into his apartment.
Well then you've got to call her, man.
You are one lucky sonofabitch, you know that?
Shoot.
And this adversely affects me how...?
Well? What are you waiting for?
Got cash.
You bet your ass I'm right. You don't go out with a loaded gun, you empty the barrels!
He can tell you're an animal nut. You are, aren't ya?
Stalker, huh?
Okay? With this pad, the killer wheels? Looks like you really cleaned up your act.
Yeah, well when you quit blow, you gotta quit the booze, too.
Here, just have one of these then.
Jesus, you know what? This shit doesn't even taste good to me anymore.
Oh yeah.
But Jesus, Pat, if she's as special as you say, she's going to want to hear about the things you did.
The bottom line is, I'm not going to use my philanthropy as some form of currency... especially after what I did.  I lied to this poor girl. Lied, man. She deserved better.
Not in months. I don't even know why I bought the damn place.
Sorry, Pat, out of beer. You like vodka?
The museum? I thought we were going out to dinner?
I know he's around here someplace.
Mary ah, forget it.
Turn it up, Magda.
Sure she is. That's why she got an unlisted number and you haven't heard squat from her in a dozen years. Oh you're good, Ted. You're a real piece of work.
Four kids, three different guys.
Hyperactive little fuckers, too. Tough to keep up with in a wheelchair, I bet.
Miami?
Hey, hey, hey!
You fucked me, man? Why would you do that?
Turn her over to a stalker.
Yeah well fuck you! You just can't stand the fact that it was my turn.
I'm talking about the letter, asshole.
Really? But he's been married for twenty years -- they've got six kids.
Have you been to  Let's see -- Santiago, Chile?
Just dumb luck. I delivered a pie to her one night and she answered the door in her nightgown -- that was it for me. I went home that night, shaved my beard, and a week later I was laid out in her office with a broken back.
Oh yeah, the plan was going along just fine until you showed up.
Ho-ly shit.
A salesman -- that's what I am. I mean, I'm gonna be anyway. I'm starting my own company -- video sales -- just as soon as I get enough seed money.
I see where you're going.
How do you guarantee that?
I can live with those reflections.
It means you're too hard on guys.
Have you been up all night again?
Magda, Puffy barks at everybody.
Jesus, Mary, you gotta hear this -- some cop's staking out this broad's apartment.
What's a mook?
The point is, love isn't about money or social standing or age, it's about connecting with someone, having things in common kindred spirits.
An old flame?
You vicious bitch, how do you sleep at night?
I've been looking for a guy -- not one of these South Beach pussies.
I mean let's face it, Mary, you're beautiful, you've got money, you trust people -- I'm just saying, there's a lot of psychos out there.
So who you taking to the prom?
Well you look great. Are you married, do you have kids?
I'm kidding. I'd really love to, Ted, but the thing is I already have plans. How about tomorrow night?
We should play some time... I mean, if you can afford to lose some money.
That's right. And the good thing is you can do it anywhere.
...and then it was all over.  We haven't spoken since.
What what are you doing here?
Ted...?
Get over here.
Yeah? What do you want?
OH FOR THE LOVE OF GOD!
One guess.
Ho there.
Now I've seen it all. What the hell were you thinking?
Hey.
Eh.
Uh-huh.
Piggyback ride.
See you, Warren.
Starshells.
Jesus Christ, guys. What the hell's Khruschev thinking?
What about the allies? Congress? I think we may need to start letting key people know. And they're all scattered across the country for the campaign. We're going to need to get the U.N. staff in and warmed up. Jesus... I don't even know if we've got secure communications with half our embassies since that the Soviets got that cryptographer of ours.
Who gives a shit about the midterms now? The Soviets are putting nuclear weapons ninety miles away from us.
They're going to be pressing for a military solution soon. We can't afford to let them ram their agenda down our throats. We need to come with options other than air strikes so we have some sort of choice here.
I'll do it.
Oh, still sore about this.
Slow down. Smell that?
Hey, Mac. You're up bright and early.
Jack and Bobby are good men. But it takes a certain character, moral toughness to stand up to --
The sun came up today.
I am instructed to tell you that the American Government would respond favorably to an offer along the lines you have discussed. If this solution were raised at the U.N. by Ambassador Zorin, he would find a favorable reply from Ambassador Stevenson.
So which one of you geniuses can tell me how to explain ourselves to the world? How do we work with them if there's been a hard-line coup?
When are you going to be home?
What's happened?
What happens to you? I'm not leaving without you.
Kenny! What happened? They didn't let me up front, said the President was on the phone the whole time.
Yeah? Who was he talking to? Acheson? Come on, O'Donnell, everyone's wondering what's going on. What's Acheson doing in town? And don't give me some bullshit about DNC think tanks. Acheson's Mr. Cold War.
So what've we got today?
Let's get out of here.
I'm not calling and canceling on Daly. You call and cancel on Daly.
All right. 'Cause you get armed boarders climbing into Soviet ships, shots being fired across bows...
I'm your political advisor, and I'm giving you political analysis here. This is a setup. The Chiefs want to go in. It's the only way they can redeem themselves for the Bay of Pigs. They have to go in, and they have to do it right. It's that simple.
Didn't know Adlai had it in him. Too bad he didn't have this stuff in '52.
Don't take it to court, but we've got good circumstantial evidence...  Walter agrees. My gut's telling me Khruschev's turning to a trusted old friend to carry his message.
We give them something. We tell them we'll remove the missiles from Turkey say, six months from now so that there appears to be no linkage. We also tell them if they go public about it, we deny it and the deal is off.
At least it will expose whether Khruschev has been overthrown. We'll know what we're dealing with.
Bob. Bet you had a late night.
Yeah.
Jesus Christ, Larry, what the fu-- Larry. That's not even your name, is it? What's your real name, you fucking scumbag?
Mr. Clear Moon.
They're going to kill me next. That's what I hear. These new Indians are destroying everything. Our people are a quiet people.
You know how in your big cities, you got your niggers and you got your Puerto Ricans? Well out here we got Indians. That's just the way it is.
What the hell you doing?!
Water. Worth killing for out here, I'd think.
Maisy Blue Legs place?
Who is he?
White eagle feather through the circle. That's their symbol.
What'd she say?
She took something from the house. What she called a medicine bundle. Most likely Jimmy's.
Her oil pan is shot.
Today. And now you -- there's a dog in the van --
Eagle's claws and a bear's balls that's what her profile says.
This was a Selective Operations Unit, Agent Levoi. There is classified information pertaining to our national security. You don't question that, you don't go digging into that shit -- that's insubordination. Jesus Christ --
Come on, Ray. Come forward.
What are you --
Big sonuvabuck. Based on the depth of that print, pressure releases... I'd say he goes two-ten, two-fifteen --
To us Indians, our spiritual relatives are as close as family. I've got seven mothers on this reservation. Sisters. Brothers. You ain't one of them.
The owl told him about Leo. That's incredible. I guess we just broke the back of this investigation, didn't we? Evidence doesn't get any harder than that -- not for my money. Is there anyway we can seduce this owl into Federal Court?
Listen to the water. Listen to the owl. He also said, don't trust the fucking Cookie Monster.
Don't be mad. That was just an old traditional gesture that means hello, how are you.
Was-te. 'Cept for one thing. Jimmy Looks Twice was nowhere near there. Ya see, when Jimmy was twelve years old, his mother and father was killed in a car wreck right down there near Elk Mountain.
I can't do that,  It's a Rolex.
Walter. When I fill out my 302, do I say that evil spirits are killing everybody on the reservation?
I can't be dicking around here. That's all I'm saying. I don't carry crystals, I don't wanna come back in another life. I just wanna do my job, and do it right, and get the fuck outta here.
Agent Little Weasel, Federal Bura of your Imagination.
Do they come in dreams, these visions?
You were running with the old ones. At The Knee. Heavy duty.
You had a vision. You had yourself a vision. A man waits a long time for a vision. Might go his whole lifetime and never get one. And along comes some instant Indian with a Mastercard and brand-new shoes, has himself a vision.
That's what we're doing here. National interest. National security. Only this time it's not gold. It's uranium.
This Jimmy's?
He tried to kill him twice before. That's a good place to start don't ya think? Leo was on the other side, wasn't he?
X21, give me a 20.
I have a pick-up truck. No plates. Subject -- Indian -- entering suspect's house. Over.
Remember that upside down flag back at Jimmy's house? Somebody took it down.
What ya want?
Since I got a iron pipe put across my knees, man. Fight with three wasi'cus, ya know.
No, that was Leavenworth. This --  was Sioux Falls. What ya want?
Not for long, Richard. You got early parole under the stipulation that you would help us in a situation, and you didn't deliver.
It isn't?
That's a big comfort to me.
Yeah, most likely.
I thought he'd never leave.
Simple deduction. It's fast. It's pretty. Sleek and stylish...It's your color...matches your lipstick.
Yes, ma'am.
Is that all? CHARLIE What else do you want?
I don't mix with the boys. I work here. Let's keep it professional.
Lieutenant...
Some one comes up hot on your six, what do you do?
That's true. What are you?
You're horrible
You ever fly an F-14? 
Danger?
That's what you get flight pay for.
Why? You act like you didn't know one day this would happen.
You look way out there. Out past the date line. West becomes East, all things change. You cross the line...today becomes yesterday...or tomorrow, I forget which.
Goose is dead.
What does it mean?
Lieutenant... What do you... usually fly?
Tomcats?
I'LL LOCK ON THEM, COUGAR.  Gotcha covered, don't nobody move.
I'm pulling up.
OKAY... OKAY. BUT IF I LAND THIS THING UPSIDE DOWN. AND I LIVE. I'LL HAVE YOUR BUTT!
THERE'S ANOTHER ONE UP THERE!
I know!
5000 feet. Speed two hundred.
3,000 feet.  We gotta go, man. 3,000 feet, we gotta go!
Is it the plane?
What was that?
Nice. Always a good idea to show up your instructors. He nods toward Jester, glaring at them from his A4. Goose indicates the backseat of the Tomcat.
What are you doing?
Keller, Black Lion Squadron. I knew him at Pensacola. He's damn good.
You ever done this before?
Great move. Great
Hi...Hi there. How ya doing in there?  Mav... Ahhh...you know, at one point I did want a Navy career.
You see all those guys with gold on their shoulders!!?... Oh, no, I think that was Johnson, Air Boss of the Kitty Hawk!
Come on, come on! It's double or nothing.. We're talking twelve bucks American, here.
Don't be greedy. Stay with Wood.
What what are you doing? We're cover!
I was a victim of circumstance.
Don't worry. I'll talk to him.
But, Skipper, Cougar's been picked for Top Gun...He's the best of the best!
Mav's a great flyer but....
Coogan spent half the night looking for her. He said he was gonna kill the son-of-a-bitch who ruined his sister.
COME OFF RIGHT--COME OFF HIGH--I'M IN--I'LL ENGAGE.
GET LOST!
You saved our lives. You did it!
I've seen this before.
Ah, the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat.
You won?!!!
Morning, Coogan.
I called your house.
You may not think so, but you are.
How can I go on? I feel so... responsible.
What happened to them?
Well, there it is; the Last Resort.  Sure you wanna go in?
I know a much better place down the block -- the girls are clean; the liquor ain't watered down...
Lemme ask you a question.  Ever fuck a mutant?
Would you like the same suite?
Hmm.  It seems you left something in our safe.
Come on, Cohaagen!  You got what you want.  Give these people air!
Richter, do you know why I'm such a happy person?
I'm afraid that's not possible.
Demure, aggressive, sleazy?  Be honest.
What do you want?
I'm listening.
Quaid!  That's Quaid!
Yeah.
You're Kuato, right?
I don't know.  Maybe.
Why not?
I did?
Harry, what the hell is this?
What the fuck did I do wrong?!  Tell me!
That son of a bitch got to be around here somewhere.
I've got a weak signal over there.
Is that better?
What are you doing?
I don't know!  It had something to do with Mars.
I know it sounds crazy, but I went to this Rekall place after work, and...
--I got a trip to Mars.
Our friends, my job, eight years together, I suppose all this was implanted too?
Right.  Mars.
To be perfectly honest with you, Doug, if outer space is your thing, I think you'd be much happier  with one of our Saturn cruises.Everybody raves about 'em.
I'm telling you, Doug, your brain won't know the difference.  Guaranteed, or your money back.
I give up.
Go on.
They'll be here any minute!  They'll kill you all!
I love you.
Ooo, whatcha been feeding that thing?
What, did you get amnesia?...How'd you get here?
Why would I lie to you?
Don't be ridiculous.
Are you all right?  Are you still you?
Cohaagen knows it makes air.  But the bastard won't turn it on.
The whole core of Mars is ice.  The reactor melts it and releases oxygen.
Rhonda.  Rhonda LeBeck.  She's getting some kind of strange readings on her things.
Or a big mother slug maybe?
BACK OFF, BURT...!
There's nothing like them in the fossil record, I'm sure...Okay, so they predate the fossil record...  That'd make them a couple of billion years old...and we've just never seen one till now.  Right.
Well, we can take my truck then.
Oh my God.
Where the hell are they?  Hope they didn't wise up.
You didn't cook breakfast?
No...it was eggs.  I did eggs.
You're gonna get us hung up.
Nothing.  But it sure might be a nice way of getting to know her.
Goddamnit, Valentine, you won't go for any gal unless she fits that damn list of yours A to Z...
Well, <u>you're</u> the one won't work in the car wash.  You're the one's gotta have a plan.
Well, whatever the hell happened it's just one more goddamn good reason to haul ass out of this place.
Those assholes are supposed to be <u>fixing</u> the goddamn road!  Hey!  Where are you guys?  People gotta use this road, you know! You on a booze break or what?!
Jesus!  I don't <u>believe</u> this!
Here's the plan: we'll get a...a flatbed, I guess, with a big winch, figure a five ton anyway.
We'll take your word for it.
Prairie dog burrow...
Well...haven't seen a sign for hours.  Maybe it's long gone.
Don't he have a home to go to?
Its tires are flat...
Get real.  I'm faster than you.
Watch your ass, shithead.
Come on, you're not going to do your lasso thing...?
What the hell are you doing?!!
Yeah...but no ties.
Somebody paying you to do this?
Burt!  Heather!
Come on.  Get away from it!
And I appreciate it.
Think it's still following us?
What's it doing?
Our own Colombian Connection... For three years... Three years of ball breaking detective work. And we put a lotta bad guys behind bars.
I don' need a hospital... I feel fine.
Ms. Vin's sister.
I will allow the witness to testify. With the understanding that your questions are confined to the area of Mr. Kim's modus operandi.
Objection.
Good morning, Mr. Dowd. Do you think you might be up to cross-examining Mr. Ortega this morning?
You can't come back here... Anything happens to you I'm liable.
Come now. Did you see the gun?
You're implying that I planted a gun?
Don't tell me where to work. I moved to New York to work for Edward Dowd. But I can't believe that Edward Dowd has nothing better to do these days than invoke exalted legal issues to get off guilty little --
I feel like I've been mugged... Guy scared the shit out of me. You made your point, Eddie... I'm relieved we're not taking the case.
What other case?
-- Easy as that, huh?
Shoulda told the one about Shu being the bastard child of Mother Theresa.
-- What?
You're carrying that around like it was a picture of your girlfriend!  I don't want to see your heart broken when this case crashes and burns!
Let's get a cab.
-- What?
They're Chinamen who speak English. We call them informants.
I've phoned every art supply retailer and wholesaler in the Tri-state area. No one's heard of Chuckie Roeder.
A fucking wheelchair?
-- Find him?
You do.
What went down?
I didn't need to know that a man I'm defending on a gang-murder rap is a prison soldier who kills over drugs?
Are you willing to testify that the man you saw shoot Jimmy Chin was not the man the cops arrested?
I'm sorry if I've ruined your day, Mr. Reynard. But my client's had a rough eight years behind bars and --
We reconvict, your man's looking at 25 years on two counts, served consecutively. So what I'd like to ask, Ed, is: Are you joking?
You're pissing me off again, Ed.
-- Objection, your Honor! This case has no connection with any subsequent act my client may be charged with!
The witness is recalcitrant, your Honor -- I had to personally make a body attachment this morning -- it took two Marshalls to drag him here!
-- Can't Mr. Dowd find his own expert witness, your Honor?
Yes, Mr. Dowd.
I can't be expected to remember the name of every informant eight years after the fact.
My skip-trace turned up two Cecil Stipes. One's in Butte, Montana. Other's at Riverhead Veterans Psychiatric.
It's okay. It was always like that.
I followed you here from court.
...And you were at the trial to... to see that justice was done?
Then it was your idea to have Chuckie Roeder scare Eddie off the case?
Look. Mister --
Five years.
Mr. Ortega, what is Shu Kai Kim's rank within La Compania?
I think what Eddie wants to say is --
Cooper, the ooze of mumbo jumbo is rising up above our heads. Do you honestly think Cole's practice of word association works?
Yes, it's a great big psychedelic circus ride, isn't it, Cooper?
No... No, go away.
That's not important. I will tell you what is important. The fan will soon be starting.
No.
No. Never. You'll have to kill me.
I'm nearly out.
This isn't Mike.  Is this Mike?
The stuff we got last night.
Let's ditch this place and party.
We can do it right here.
Bobby's got it.
Your behavior is not funny and is wasting the time of the Federal Government.
We got a phone, here, that's got a little ring.
That's not the way to Cliff's trailer. I told you.
Is that Agent Desmond's vehicle?
You weren't kiddin'. This stuff's got the sting of the forty-eight hour blend.
Is there a golf course around here?
Yes...
OK, Gordon.
Congratulations. I heard about that.
He's dead -- good and dead.
No.
Take a good look around. There's nobody in this place -- you're meetin' the reason why. What'll it be?
Federal Bureau of Investigation, Special Agent Chet Desmond. I'd like to ask you a few questions about Teresa Banks. Jack said you knew her. How well?
Came looking for a job with a friend of hers. Pretty girl. Could've been her sister.
Sort of shorthand.
We're heading into a difficult situation.
Oh, the uncle is missing.
So the sheriff had got an Uncle who's committed a serious crime.
The dress she was wearing had been altered to fit her. I noticed a different colored thread where the dress had been taken in. It wasn't her dress or she must have lost some weight.
No one could find those splinters without a machine like this. And no one had a machine like this.
She lived alone.
You better dust this place, Sam.
Take a look at this.
My guess is there isn't enough detail in the photo to get an idea of the design on the ring, but we should do a blowup of this anyway.
One thing that has been troubling me. That lamp at the diner. Do you think they were working on it for esthetic reasons or was their work due to faulty wiring?
If I am going to get through math today, you're going to have to bring me up to speed quick.
Are you going to see James tonight?
You want a muffin?
If I had a nickel for every cigarette your mom smoked, I'd be dead.
I won't wear your stuff.  I promise.
How did the car get back here?
But I love you, Laura.
Why do you do it, Laura?
Hey, Pete. Can't believe your tank's dry up at the mill.
What'll it be?
Nice night.
You missed somethin', Ed.
Even this heavy work beats being at home with the old ball and chain.
The diary was hidden too well. He's the only one who could know where it was. He's getting to know me, now. He's real. He speaks to me.
Laura, you didn't come and see me today.
Laura, you have to deal with all of this.
Right on time, baby.
We were supposed to be together.
This afternoon?
What about tonight?
What's going on?
You always hurt the ones you love.
Bobby killed a guy.
Johnny, Johnny... let your Daddy and your Uncle and Leland talk.  Ben... Leland, we can play the French against the Norwegians. What do the French love more than anything?
No.
No.
You'd think so.
Oh, honey, you don't have to lie to me. Ever. You can tell me anything. I'll understand.
I hate asparagus.
Good night, Mom.
The Norwegians are coming next week and I want you to learn to say what I just learned in Norwegian. So you can talk to them. I want you to learn to say, "Hello, my name is Leland Palmer".
Did you get this from your lover?
Oh, Leland, sit down and eat you dinner.
I don't know.
Someone who knows how to clean knows where the object was before she started cleaning and then that object goes back to its exact same spot. Shelly, I know where everything in this house is. Sometimes on the road I mentally go through this whole house and picture where every item is.
I'm going to show you how to wash this tile and then you're going to do it.
Laura just took off. She asked me to do the run today. Should I do it?
How good's your intelligence?
Four cases in three years...
No -- we don't want this case in court.
...he wants to testify...?
They want to settle.  It means a lot of money.
Yes.  It is a crime. A serious crime.
...sworn before God you would tell the truth?
And wasn't that an oath...? These are your initials here: K.C. When you signed this chart you took an oath. No less important than that which you took today.  Isn't that right?  Isn't that right...?
...what in the world would induce you to make a photocopy of some obscure record and hold it four years? This is a... why? Why would you do that?
Orthopedics?
...of Anesthesiology?
How old are you?
Objection, we've...
Mr. Concannon...?
No further questions.
Say it.
...the Archdiocese called up, they said who was our attorney, 'cause the case is coming to trial...
You said you're gonna call me up. You didn't call me up. Who do you think you are?  Who do you think you are...?
I have some errands to run, and then I thought we'd spend the evening...
Cardiac arrest. During delivery her heart stopped. When the heart stops the brain's deprived of oxygen. You get brain damage. That is why she's in the state she's in today.
I'm afraid that's not true.  Will you want me to stay on till Monday?
You sure you don't want me to stay on.
I... given the limits of your question, that's correct.
They gave her the wrong anesthetic.
...she went in complaining of stomach cramps. Good doctor would have doubted the information on the chart.
I am on the staff of...
The Archdiocese called, they want to settle... her estate...
Mrs. Simmonds.
And did you write the numeral 'one' down on the record, standing for one hour?
A single hour.
I need an extension for my case.
Is the Plaintiff ready?
Do we have time this morning to...  All right. Mr. Galvin, you want to continue now, or we can resume with Dr. Thompson this afternoon.
Are you done?
Jimmy!  That's why the court exists. The court doesn't exist to give them justice, eh? But to give them a chance at justice.
They might. Yes. That's the point... is that they might... you see, the jury wants to believe. They're all cynics, sure, because they want to believe. I have to go in there tomorrow to find twelve people to hear this case. I'm going to see a hundred people and pick twelve. And every one of them it's written on their face, 'This is a sham. There is no justice...' but in their heart they're saying, 'Maybe... maybe...'
What happened...?
I've got to work...
You do what you want. You want to leave... You want to go kill yourself?
Maybe I'll tell you later.
What is your wife's picture doing by the side of your...
Joe...  Joe...
Continental Casualty...
Mr. Galvin's...
This is Mr. Wallace in Subscriptions?
We find that your subscription lapsed...
Yes, we know that you do. I have it in my files. That's at the Manhattan Health Center...
I'll just take a minute. Deborah Ann Kaye. You know what I'm talking about. The case is going to trial. Our chief witness is a Dr. David Gruber, you know who he is?
He saw her at the Northern Care...
Are we going to win?  We have, you know, other tactics, though...
I had an appointment at his office, I think I must have got it wrong. We had a meeting...
Another, Frank...?
I want to buy you a drink.
Hi, Mickey...
Are you out of your mind...?
...he's a good man...
Who have we got?
Forget it. You can't prove it. Sister's testimony is no good. Jury knows we win she gets the cash.
What I'm saying, they're getting some help.
Who? They're all testifying. Everybody who was in the O.R.'s going to take the stand.
But those notations stop...  ...Four-and-one-half minutes after Deborah Ann Kaye's...
What happened in those three minutes...?
Brain damage could have been... it didn't necessarily take nine minutes, it could have been caused in two...
Before he can get there here comes this Federal Marshal, and Franky's indicted for Jury tampering, they throw him in jail, he's gonna be disbarred, his life is over.  Jimmy, gimme another drink.  How are you?
It's an enemy sneak attack.  Let's get outta here!
There's nobody left around here now.
Did you see it come down?
The troops are certainly moving in here!
No, on the campus.  I haven't any family.
How long was I out?
Maybe they aren't too sure we're here.
My kid brother has one.  You know why?
How'd you guess?
That's what knocked the phones out, too.
This Martian blood...  Let's make a quick analysis and see what we've got!
I got a message for you.  You're the guys from Pacific-Tech, ain't you?
We will, sir!
Thank you, sir.  If they start anything, we can blast them right off the earth!
That probably dropped half way to Pomona!...What do you think?
Uncle Matthew...this is Dr. Clayton Forrester.  My uncle - Dr. Matthew Collins, pastor of the Community Church.
They don't do much of anything...!
They are living creatures out there.
Number three to. D.O....Number three to D.O.
Must be somebody in there.
I thought you'd killed Freddy off.
And since you've been thinking of making it.  Has anything funny happened?
Just an earthquake, Dylan.  Every once in a while we get a few.
No, you don't.
Heather, I'm stuck here.  Neither Chuck or Terry came in today.  I can't get away!
Dylan?  He's holding well.  Earlier he had some problems, he's in an oxygen tent just now...
These look quite fresh.
Ms. Langenkamp.  I suggest you go home and get some rest.  Your son is fine. He's been taken downstairs for further testing.
I want my kid out of here now!
Someone's coming.
Rex saved me.
Tomorrow night.
You okay, champ?
Tell you what.  I'm gonna go get Rex for you right now.  You know home isn't far from here, right?
Dylan, where's the man?
Everything went great, I thought.  We really got you, didn't we?
When do you think it'll be done?
I know what he's doing is bizarre, but most of the time he seems so normal, so well adjusted.  I just can't believe it's him.  I mean, and not something outside, influencing him.  Or is that how denial works?
You didn't jump in.
Freddy, for all I know.
Really?
Holy...
The car's no there yet?
No, Rex is not going to die.  Julie, you know where the sewing stuff is, don't you?
No, I don't think that at all.  How is he?
I can tell you what the nightmares are about.  They're about this...entity. Whatever you want to call it.  It's old, very old, and it's taken different forms in different times.  The only thing that stays the same about it is what it lives for.
I don't know if it has, really.  With the exception of One and Three, I've pretty much kept out of it.  I'm working in television now.  The hours let me spend more time with my husband and little boy.
Because we believed we could make an impact out here.  Self reliance and community through the disciplines of sailing.
Phil, he's not looking inside.  He's just striking out at the world.
Oh I was walkin' down Lime street one day...
She said "None the better, you all go to hell..."
But your instinct was to lose sail?
It didn't go over 'til I turned her starboard!
Why don't you go and try some of that on?
Fine.
When we were growing up I always felt like you would take care of things, that everything would be okay.  But you can't make this okay, can you?
Rick March.  Who the hell are you?
She isn't that old.
Where you going?
I cheated to get on the boat!!!  All right?!
That we're going back.  I don't want it to end.  I don't want to be what I was when I left.
I'm just not like you.  Ya know? I'm never going to go to Yale.  I'm never going to be "William".
Sorry to here it.
But that's not the point...
Goodbye Mom.  I'll be okay.
I feel like I got you into this.
My brother.  He fell out of the old beech tree.  Broke his neck.  I was on a camp out.  They started going at it, throwin' things, a real knock down...  They didn't find him 'till the next morning.  They didn't even know why he was up there.
I can't go in there.
Ah... Northeast... sir.
Northeast sir!
Why do you think I'm sending him home?
Then what do you think he was trying to do.
Indentured servitude is not what my son had in mind.
I'll be frank with you.  This was his mother's idea.  A romp through the Caribbean on a sailboat sounds more like a vacation than an education if you ask me.
What is it we can do for you today?
What's wrong, you don't like steak?
Spying?!
I think you were too hard on Weathers.
And being sixteen.
Damn, Porkchop, you sound just like a guy who ain't never seen a pair.
Much have I traveled in realms of gold/ And many goodly states and kingdoms seen/ Round many western islands have I been/ Which bards in fealty to Apollo hold/ Oft of one wide expanse had I been told/ That deep-browed Homer ruled as his demesne.
You're the one who doesn't care, Phil.
Phil.  What are you doing?
You climb damn it, or so help me I'll haul you to the foretop by your diaper and leave you there!
We'd come twelve thousand miles together, through every kind of seas imaginable...
The papers are going to eat you alive.  Even if you beat it, you'll never get another commission.  They want someone to be accountable.
Soon as we ship it'll be "forgetta".
Everybody knows why she went over Tod.  You jibed the boat.
What's Cao Ben?
Hey, pretty woman... Sailor here?
Man, I gotta take a piss bad... Can I use your head there?
Hey... You gotta smell in this room of puke... You been pukin' in here, little girl? Huh?... You sick?... Pregnant?
Let's go by Rosarita's. You been there yet?
No.
Why should it?
You heard from Reggie?
About. Where Lafitte crosses over Galvez Highway. State Road 86.
So who you out sleuthin' for now?... Can I help ya?
But how are you finding New Orleans, Senor Farragut?
Mr. San Pedro Sula's authorized to carry a .45.
He wants to take Mr. San Pedro Sula and me bass fishing.
But I'm a robber and a manslaughterer and I haven't had any parental guidance.
But I'm wild at heart.
I'm sorry to do this to ya here in front of a crowd, but I want ya to stand up and make a nice apology to my girl.
General Osvaldo Tamarindo y Ramirez. Telefono 666.
Hasta siempre.
Do you know how it came about that copper wire was invented in Scotland?
I'll hire a hit man if you don't want to help me stop this thing. I'll call Marcello Santos.
No, Marietta, I haven't found 'em.
How'd she sound? Was she doin' okay?
What is it, Johnnie?
Who?... Uncle Pooch?...
Johnnie... That's the past... We gotta get on to our future, sugar!
Heard grandpa Santos and grandmama talkin'.
I'm scared, mama.
Hey baby...
Hey, my snakeskin jacket... Thanks, baby... Did I ever tell you that this here jacket for me is a symbol of my individuality and my belief in personal freedom?
Well, I was thinkin' about smokin' actually... My mama smokes Marlboros now, used to be she smoked Kools? I stole 'em from her beginnin' in about sixth grade. When I got old enough to buy my own, I bought those. Now I've just about settled on Mores, as you probably noticed? They're longer.
You have such a pretty, long neck, like a swan.
Sailor, you are somethin' else, honey... When I was fifteen, Mama told me that pretty soon I'd be startin' to think about sex, and I should talk to her before I did anything about it.
Uncle Pooch came in the side door through the porch, you know? Where I was makin' a jelly and banana sandwich? I remember I had my hair in curlers cause I was goin' that night with Vicki and Cherry Ann, the DeSoto sisters. Uncle Pooch must have known nobody but me was home, cause he came right in and put both his hands on my butt and sorta shoved me up against the counter.
So how'd he finally nail you? Right there in the kitchen?
That don't seem fair.
Oh, you know exactly what I mean, honey? It'd make the future so simple and nice.
Actin' funny how?
Sailor!
How about that one? The Host of the Old South Hotel.
Got you a pack of Mores again, huh?
We're about dry bones, sweetheart. We don't wanna have to push this "bird" into New Orleans.
I love it when your eyes get wild, honey. They light up all blue almost and little white parachutes pop out of 'em. Oh, Sailor you're so aware of what goes on with me? I mean, you pay attention. And I swear, you got the sweetest cock. Sometimes it's like it's talkin' to me when you're inside? Like it's got a voice all it's own. You get right on me.
What's that, peanut?
Lula, sometimes I gotta admit, you come up with some weird thoughts...
You got me, peanut.
What was this one?
I'll be damned if I'm leavin'. That band is too good?
You notice that woman when we come in? The white woman sittin' by herself?
More'n likely.
Honey, I'm sorry. It wasn't nothin'. Come on and get up and we'll take off.
Oh shit...
How'd you know my daddy?
I didn't want to say it... but I had a feelin' Santos was up to somethin' with your mama...
There's worse places, honey.
Let's get ahold a' her quick.
Anything I can do for you?
Sailor? You know what?
It's okay by me, peanut.
You been drinkin', huh?
Yeah... He was lookin' for you.
That was a accident. I bet both our asses Bobby Peru done murdered all kinds of people, and meant it, too.
He's the kind liked it.
Really, Sail, I'll be okay.
LULA!!!!
...live in exchange for sexual favors. Police said they have identified and questioned at least four girls, all Asians twelve to fifteen years old, who have been living in the North Houston warehouse with a Vietnamese pimp since February. The girls are being treated as victims, said police Sergeant Amos Milburn. 'These are really just children,' he said, 'but they've been exposed to a lot already.
Mama???
Call me again soon? I'll be waitin' by the phone.
I'm goin', mama. No way I can't go.
I'm afraid his car is gone, Mrs. Fortune.
Perhaps we should call a local law enforcement officer.
I knew you'd want it again...
Big is the key word, and I'm telling you I want it bad.
Just tell me what you want.
Simple? Kill him? How?
Well, like kill him with the atomic bomb?
Where? In the leg?
Where?
You want me to shoot Sailor in the brains with a gun.
Wrong! It's much better to blow a hole in the back of the head... right toward the bridge of the nose... Lots and lots of irreparable damage.
You're not tellin' me that you're sweet on him?
I got your message... But you went right to Johnnie, didn't you?... I can't trust you, bitch - not for one minute... Naughty girl... Sailor and Lula are headed west, and guess what? There's no turning back. I'm in a killing mood.
Santos... What's happenin' here?
...Sailor Ripley... Can I talk to Lula?
By who?
You really are one dumb asshole.
Does that girlfriend of yours know that her mama and Santos killed her daddy?  Does she know her own daddy was one of the biggest drug dealers around - till he started snortin' the shit himself?...  Does she know you was around that night her daddy was set fire to?
What he means is, it's difficult to distill the essence of a book sometimes. It lives in the mind.
Mm.
It's fine. It's done. Basically. I'm just sort of... tinkering with it.
Is that just beer?
I'm sure. Where is everyone?
Well, I'm going to read it anyway.
That was good.
What's this guy's problem?
Wait here. I'll be right back.
Listen, Hannah, I'm flattered, really, but right now I --
You stay there.
Good God. Let's go rescue him.
How bad is it for you?
Is he awake?
Shut up, James.
Kind of a sign, you're saying.
I'll be... somewhere else.
Bullshit. It's mine, motherfucker.
I've been doing that a lot lately.
Do you think that's why I've been having these...  ...spells?
The last month maybe.
Who the hell is that?
Let me get this straight. All that paper that went into the river. That was the only copy?
Boy or girl?
Right. Well, thanks. For the lift.
I'm in Kinship. Listen, Sara, there's some things we need to talk about...
What? No. There's no one here. I'm just... just...
The one she wore on her wedding day?
It's feels unreal, like butterfly wings or... something. It must've cost Dr. Gaskell a lot.
Do you have a mirror? It's the best way to see if someone's breathing.
Trust me, James, when the family pet's been assassinated, the owner doesn't want to hear one of her students was the triggerman.
Whose tuba is that anyway?
Can I ask you something about her?
Looks like... our old friend Mr. Codeine. That should take the pinch out of my ankle.  Have one.
Mmhmmm... knap... sap...
Oh.
He didn't give his name.
The guy on the phone.
He wanted to know if a Grady Tripp lived here and drove a dark maroon 1966 Ford Galaxie 500 with black interior.
And... and before that. Did I do anything? Anything bad?
Who?
She seemed to take it pretty well.
Kinship. And what's here?
Maybe she didn't come here.
Okay, James, I wish you hadn't shot my girlfriend's dog. Even though Poe and I weren't exactly what you'd call simpatico, that's no reason for him to take two in the chest. Still, the fact remains that I'm the one who took you up into the Chancellor's bedroom. I'm the one who has to take the blame. I don't know what the hell I was thinking.
That's why you're having them. Your spells.
When?
I remember that. Five or six years ago.
Near Carvel?
Get out of here.
I'm a little worried, James.
Me? Sure. Why?
James. This is my editor, Terry Crabtree.
So what are you going to do?
Jesus.
I uh, I didn't finish, I... fell asleep.
Professor Tripp.
My God, I wear the same scent as a transvestite. She IS a transvestite, isn't: she?
Has he asked to see the book yet?
You had another one, didn't you? You have to see a doctor, Grady. First thing Monday morning. All right?
No, really, Sara, I don't think you --
Not have it.
Are you limping? Why are you limping?
Gee, Grady, that sounded so heartfelt. I don't know whether to swoon or smirk.
No, I don't think you do. And besides... I haven't decided yet.
I'm not very happy with you right now, Grady. But more importantly, Walter's not very happy and he's gotten the police involved. They seem to think James Leer is somehow responsible for all of this. You wouldn't happen to know where James is, would you, Grady?
Someone stole my car.
You didn't happen to call the house last night, did you, Grady?
And what do you think you might have said?
He told you.
I went and looked at some babies just now.
Does he still love you?
Did you just make that up?
I need a ride.
Couldn't he have just thrown a shoe at the poor thing?
Listen, Antonia --
Tony. I'm sorry if things didn't work out so well for you tonight. With Terry.
He's writing his name in water.
I know it's you, Grady, I just... Christ, Grady, do you know what time it is?
What exactly are we doing here, Professor Tripp?
What made you pull out that old thing?
Maybe I should read it.
Well, there's always people you don't know at these things, but I can't say there was anybody particularly suspicious... Wait. There was one guy. Tiny fella. Claimed to be a jockey.
Hardapple?
Huh? Oh, someone pulled a B&E on Dr. Gaskell's closet. And the dog's missing.
Oh man, that kid takes himself real serious.
I'll never forget you got me started there.
Hey, is that a school?
Cherry.
Then why the fuck are you giving it back to me?!
She was going to throw it out, wasn't she? Just toss it like a scrap of wood.
I made that table for you and Annette, for your wedding. I put a lot of love into it.
I've got some good news.
You're a good man, Walter. Okay, you did some wrong things, but inside you're a good, decent man.
What are you looking at?
There's a million birds here.
Something like that.
See anything interesting?
A pretty girl like you should have a lot of friends.
What's up?
Okay?
Your ivy. Too much direct sunlight. These plants don't like a lot of sun.
Don't be witty.  Yesterday you took the number twelve bus from work, but instead of getting off at your normal stop, for some reason you stayed on. Why did you stay on the bus, Walter?
I'll be asking the questions.  Last night, you hear anything unusual? Screams? Shouts?
A man was badly beaten across the street. You know anything about that?
The assault took place at approximately seven thirty.
I wasn't feeling well.
So. How are you adjusting?
No.
A long time ago, I was sent far away. When they let me come back, all my friends were gone.
Banished... yeah.
What's her name?
It's called sarcasm, Dr. Rosen.
I'd like you to keep a journal.
I don't understand.
It's very good, indeed.
How's the journal?
Is it just my cheery personality that makes your skin itch?
How do you feel about that?
Do you think you're crazy?
Is that what you are angry about?
Fuck you, Rosen!
You don't know!
Go home, Walter.
To relax.
Where?
But roughly, how old?
And what are you doing?
I don't like nobody behind my back!
You felt pleasure.
Did you get an erection?
She's still really hurt... and angry. I don't know... if she will ever... forgive me. I understand that. I do. I just hope... I just want her to...
It's going to take time, Walter.
How do you feel about that?
Your windows face south. Northern light is the purest. But southern light is very good.
You plan to drink both those beers?
So?
I didn't say I didn't enjoy it.
So, what did you do?
I never hurt them. Never.
You don't molest little girls anymore, do you?
You really believe that?
You know, this is crazy.
I love all of them. They're strong, gentle men with families of their own. And if you asked them about what they did to me, they'd call you a fucking liar and then beat the shit out of you.
You're scared.
Neither am I.
What's this?
Don't do that.
I heard they were filthy birds.
She went front-office on you.  Tighten that for me, right there.  That's it.
You done impressing yourself, ace?
How you guys doing?
Where are we?
Lord Almighty.
Deep and slow, big guy.  Deep and slow.  Just breathe easy.
Okay, Jammer.  No problem.  You stay right here. I have to go there to the end... you'll see my lights.  We'll stay in voice contact.  Just hold onto the rope.  Five more minutes.  Okay?
Thanks.  How you feeling, big guy?
We were that close to proving a submersible drilling platform could work.  We had over seven thousand feet of hole down for Chrissake.  I can't believe you let them grab my rig!
You wimp.  I had a lot riding on this.  They bought you... more like least rented you cheap--
So what about "Michael" then... Mr. Brooks Brothers... Mr. BMW.  You still seeing him?
I'll tell you what happened... you woke up one day and realized the guy never made you laugh.
But you think it's something else.  What?  One of ours?
What's the scoop, ace?
Jesus, Lindsey--
No.
I think it likes you.
Try again.
Good hundred yards, I'd say.
Son of a bitch!
I know!  I know!  But we better come up with something.
Okay, look, you swim to the rig and come back with another suit.
It is insane.
Coffey, we're a little pressed for time.
Virgil?
That's Perry.
Do we just leave him there?
Come on, man.  What else could it be?
'Fish'?
Lady, we better fish or cut bait.
Look, we've all made chamber runs to this depth. We're checked out.
I want 'round-the-clock manning of the sonar shack and the exterior cameras.  We need early warning if the Soviet craft try another incursion.
Cab Three, check.  Right behind you.
Figured that out for yourself, did you?
A non-terrestrial intelligence.
No.  Just you and me.  We get some proof, then tell them.  Hippy, look... if was can prove to Coffey it's not Russians, maybe he'll ease off the button a little.
Uh, oh...
You boss is having a full-on meltdown.  Guy's fixing to pull the pin on fifty kilotons and we're all ringside!
He's losing it.  Talk to him.  Keep him with us.
When do you have to go back?
Sandro... A month is too long a time. I have become used to being without you.
Did you sleep well?
Which one shall I wear?
But how could you say such a thing?
I presume by this method that you'll be able to uncover some new clue, either a handkerchief or an article of clothing... In other words, something which your men have not been able to find as yet.
These people are contemptible. They have no sense of dignity at all.
It couldn't have come from anywhere else. At least, somewhere from that vicinity... But I really can't understand it. Contraband cigarettes on that island! It's the first time that ever happened.
What is that one over there called?
Well?
I think you're very sweet, Corrado.
Really! Still, it remains to be seen why she invented a shark. What was her purpose in that?
There's nothing much to laugh at.
Nothing... nothing at all!
Has she ever spoken to you about me?
Where are you going?... To Montaldo's?
Sandro, I don't want you to come with me, I don't want to see you... How can I make it clear to you?...Why did you come?
Really, I've got to stop this business with Ettore... I would like to go back and start working on my own projects again. You know, I had many ideas...
Yes. We'll get married. You and I. What do you say?
That's why I asked you...
Then I'll see you later.
Sandro ...What's the matter?
Did the hotel manager speak to you about that place nearby?
No, Sandro... We should go. Besides, we haven't been in touch with anybody. Not even with Anna's father. We should have at least sent a wire or telephoned... let's be fair, he must be feeling awfully lonely.
Sandro, I'm not coming down.
I'm too sleepy.
Well, with a shark running loose around the place, I for one won't get aboard that raft! They'll have to catch it first. I want to see it right here before my feet, dead or alive.
Tell me, Claudia, what do you think of Raimondo?
I just can't leave without first searching those islands, one by one.
Shouldn't we try to find a quieter place?
How do you manage to put up with all this confusion? You always said people bore you.
My childhood, instead, was a very sensible one.
Patrizia... Patrizia ... Where's Ettore?
Looks like the weather is changing.
Let's try to be practical about this. The best thing to do is for all of you to go to the closest island that has a police station, or something, and report the disappearance. I'll remain here... because... well, I don't know, but it seems to me that something may turn up. Anyway, I just don't feel like leaving.
I wonder where they could have unloaded the stuff ... Maybe right here at Lisca.
Nothing, nothing  at all. I was just looking for Sandro.
You men are all so dreadful!
Giulia...
It's strange how anxious women are to display themselves. It's almost a natural inclination.
But why me?... Ask Claudia, she's much more beautiful than me.
I work there but I'm really a stranger.
Certainly a radio this small is very practical. It's especially useful for... I don't know... for traveling.
Anything new develop?
Here I am, Patrizia. I'm always here.
Agnes, it has come to my attention that you have stopped eating. Why is this? AGNES  I've been commanded by God.
Yes.
I can't say.
It's a sin to be fat.
I... I am a little child but my body keeps getting bigger and soon I... I won't be able to fit in, I... I won't be able to squeeze into Heaven.
God blew up the Hindenburg. He'll blow me up, that's what she said...
I'm being punished.
We're not in the Middle Ages, Sister.
A few years ago one of the Sisters came to me in tears, asking for comfort, comfort because she was too old to have any children. Not that she wanted to, but once a month she had been reminded of that possibility.
Should you see a doctor?
Hello. I'm Doctor Livingston. I've been asked to talk to you. May I?
No I'm not.
Let's talk about something else.
I don't know.
Have you ever loved anyone?
Uh huh.
Agnes, have you ever loved another man... other than, Jesus Christ?
Well do you love... do you love Father Martineau?
Something I ate.
From their heads...
No, they say it came from the waste paper basket!
From God.
I don't understand what you're talking about... you want to talk about the baby... everybody wants to talk about the baby but... I never saw the baby so I can't talk about the baby because... I don't believe in the baby.
No... no, I don't want to answer any more questions.
What's your real name?
Sister Paul was in her eighties?  Did she climb up here often?
You have trouble sleeping?
What things?
How did she know that?
Agnes...
I promise I won't laugh. Who told her?
Do you believe she really saw them?
Why not?
What the child?
And you're unhappy.
She can't hurt you any more.
How does she know that?
Agnes, oh Agnes, Agnes I want you to do something. I want you to pretend that I'm your mother. Oh yes, only this time I want you to tell me what you're feeling, alright?
Are you intelligent?
I'm frightened.
Why?
Hm hmm.
A crucifix.
I feel as if I've eaten glass.
Do you remember what just happened?
That's good. Do you feel well enough to stand?
Agnes, can you hear me?
So I could go to him.
She'd seen him too.
Are you frightened?
It's bleeding... I'm bleeding... my God it won't stop, I can't get it to stop.  Let go of me, I wish you were dead.
And then... what did she do?  Agnes what did she do?
???
Eve, she strangled a baby!
I don't know.
???
Yes, that's because I'm getting to her.
No, no, no...
It's Martha, Mama.  There you go.
Oh, we own the land around here. But we rent it out. We keep a few acres for ourselves,  some wheat, corn, some vegetables.
No. We work the land alone. No-one but Sister Marguerite and I are permitted contact with the public.
No.
And you had a sister who died in the convent.
Do you still go to church?
You can call me Sister.
And you didn't try to find out who?
Don't ask me those questions dear, I'm not the patient.
I've already told you what I thought.
That's absurd!
Why didn't you take her to a doctor?
She is not a child.
I am...
What good would it do. No matter what you decide it's either the... the prison or the nut house and the differences between them are pretty thin.
Do you have a... a diary or a day book?
Listening to angels?
Why didn't you do anything to stop her?
That's all?  That's enough!  She was a beautiful little girl.
I wasn't. I wasn't. She was the pretty one. She died, why not me?  I never said my morning prayers. And I was ugly, I was scrawny, I had buck teeth and freckles all over my face, do you know what the nun called me, Sister Mary Clitus, called me Polkadot Livingston.
My sister died in a convent. And it's her voice I hear.  Does my smoking bother you?
I'm out of prac...  ... practice. 
Even Christ would partake socially.
Right.  What do you suppose today's saints are smoking?
Do you think they ever existed?
For Agnes.
Why must he be anybody?
There as no man in the convent on that night and no way for any man to get in or out.
That's what I have to believe...
Somebody told her.
This is permission to take her apart.
You tied the cord around its neck.
That's enough.
Oh, don't do this!
Of course, John.
The usual ten per cent?
Well --
I'm a deserter.
Yeah, I've blown school out.
Oh, it's all right.
Ginger's mad, he says things all the time and Eddy's good at punching and spitting.
Can you fix him for me?
All right, all right. If you don't need this lot, I'll lock 'em up in the dressing room till you do.
Would you like to be a little more precise, sir?
We're nearly there, sir.
Now, you'll like these. You really "dig" them. They're "fab" and all the other pimply hyperboles.
And that pose is out too, Sunny Jim. The new thing is to care passionately, and be right wing. Anyway, you won't meet Susan if you don't cooperate.
Get him out of here!!
Ringo!
Oh, listen to teacher's pet.
Are you supposed to be here?
I'm warning you, they'll be back in a minute.
Thank you.
You don't half slam the door in people's faces, do you? I mean, what about when you're playing the part, like, hundreds of people'll see you and ...
Pity.
Have you no natural resources of your own? Have they even robbed you of that?
When you could be out there betraying a rich American widow or sipping palm wine in Tahiti before you're too old like me. A fine neat and trim lad the class of you should be helping himself to life's goodies before the sands run out. Being an old age pensioner's a terrible drag on a man and every second you waste is bringing you nearer the Friday queue at the Post Office.
Well, you got me here so do your worst but I'll take one of you with me.  Oh, I know your game, get me in the tiled room and out come the rubber hoses but I'll defy you still.
You ugly, great brute you, you have sadism stamped all over your bloated British kisser.
Hello, Grandfather!
And we're looking after him, are we?
Come on let's get this coffee.
That'll keep you busy.
All right, how about Ringo? I mean ... he's very upset, you know ... and as far as your girlfriend, little Audrey's concerned, she's finished with men for the rest of her natural, and another thing ...
Oh, it's all right for you but those two girls were scared to death! Honest, Grandad, why? I mean, why do you do these things?
Anything to spare?
Well, what are we waiting for?
What are you doing there?
How d'you reckon that one out?
Well we know that but what's he doing here?
Aye, that's what I'm afraid of!
I hope he fell off.
Don't worry, son, we'll get you the best lawyer trading stamps can buy.
Gaw, it's depressing in here, isn't it? Funny...  'cos they usually reckon dogs more than people in England, don't they? You'd expect something a little more palatial.  Come on. Let's have a little action. Let's do something, then.
You won't interfere with the basic rugged concept of my personality, will you, girl?
What's he know?
What's old got to do with it?
Look he's a mixer and a trouble maker!
Are you listening to me, Lennon?
Now get on with it.
No, you look here, John. I've only one thing to say to you.
Oh, wait a minute, don't tell me you're ...
Oh you are, I know you are.
You are.
My eyes are lighter.
Is it?
He's betrayed the class.
Well!
Have <U>you</U> lost him?
I've got the stuff. Come here.
Well ...
Are you in pain?
Dell, what's the last thing you can remember?
Where's Irth?
I don't recognize that constellation.
Any rotation?
I'll go first.
Just machinery.
Maybe we can get in by the top.
What was that Dell, I lost you, do you read me?
Don't you remember?
I'm really starving; can we get some food before we go into the freezers?
Computer, this is Captain Standard. What conditions are you talking about?
Unknown!  What do you mean?
Yes!
Just a minute, hold it, I'm checking.
Dead!
Oh, no.  Oh, no.
And then we run out of food and oxygen.
That one section of the ventilator shaft has only two outlets -- you notice?  The food storage room on one end --
Well, uh... good luck.  I hope you won't need me, but if you do, I'm here.
It's really on there tight.
So does anybody have any suggestions?
Might even incinerate the damn thing.
It's a crude symbolic language -- looks primitive.
Hey now, what is this?
Well, those things out there aren't the same, you know -- the spaceship and the pyramid.  They're from different cultures and different races.  That ship just landed here -- crashed like we did.  The pyramid and the thing from it are indigenous.
Now we're in for it.
He's running a fever.
I think I could cobble something together.  A long metal rod with a battery in it.  Give it a hell of a shock.
Don't worry, it won't damage it, it'll just give it a little incentive.
<u>How</u>?
If we could just get the <u>creature</u> into the lifeboat, we could launch it into space and blow it up.
Well... now we have to herd that thing up here.
Can you get them back?
What do you mean, no?
But they don't know about the translation!  They could be in danger right now.
I think it's going to be almost impossible to drive it up into the lifeboat.
This should do it.
Just keep your finger off the button till she's way away from the ship, that's all.
Just settle down.  Sandy, you get any response yet?
Oh God, oh God no.
No, thank God... just missed him.
That sounds a little fanciful...
We'll have to catch it and eject it from the ship.
We came out there, we'll go back.  A long time by the clock, but a short time to us.
I've got Hunter... and something else as well, in front of him.
They're on the next level up.
They're getting pretty close now.
Okay.
All right, tycoons, let's stop spending our credit and start worrying about the job at hand.
Where are we?
This is Chaz speaking.  Sorry, but we are not home.  Our present location seems to be only halfway to Irth. Remain at your posts and stand by. That is all.
Oh my God.
Zero.  Dry as a bone.
Not a one.  It's dead.
Okay, Chaz, I hear you.  I've got you on my board.
Martin?
Hey, can you guys hear me?
You hear me, Martin?  Open the outer door.
Where did the parasites come from?
Engaged.
That's a flip-flop gate to channel the air, but we can use it to trap the thing.
How did it get so <u>big</u>?
Which presumably means...
I saw it.  Faust got himself jammed in the air lock door.  His body held it open.
It was time for that a couple days ago.
Let's hear it.
Can I... um... have some water?  Please?
Looks like a spore.  Fungus of some kind, maybe?
Good argument for gun-control.  What are you going after, rhino?
Minh...
Cassie, thank Christ!  We're under attack.
Give or take.
Are you alright?
I can't reach her.  Too much signal break-up.
Picking up velocity.
What's going on?
How much air-time have I got?
Deal.
C'mon, man.  One more sweep.
Listen to what?
Forget it, man.
What?  Where?
Is it still moving?
Nobody wander off on their own until it's found.  Keep in pairs. Diller, once the first team's done their sweep I want you to go down with Annie to Three-Pump while she replaces it.
Shit!  Our armory's a big blue box from the back shelf of stores.  We got about two clips left for an autoloader, and that's it.
We had to.  They were just too cumbersome for some of the conduits you're gonna have to negotiate.  Besides, all the crap floating around reduces visibility to the extent where I doubt having helmet lights would have make that much difference, anyway.  Maintenance lights down there oughta be enough to do the trick.
Okay, I'm out of here!
Uh-huh.  Used to get it pretty bad.  I'd wake up in a cold sweat and want to claw open a vacuum hatch.
What is that?
Don't worry about it.  If the Network goes by the book, like everyone figures they will, a Marine gunboat from Powell'll drop-by for a look- see in four-or-five days.  They can go poke around out there and find whatever it was hit us.  All we've gotta do is sit tight.
Yeah.  Somebody won.
How's it going?
And what is your name?
Phoebe?
May I come in?
Of course your performance was no surprise to me. After the other day I regarded it as no more than - a promised fulfilled.
Heart to heart? Woman to woman? Including a casual reference to the part of "Cora" - and your hopes of playing it.
I don't think that's funny.
Aren't you?
Champion to champion.
You're too short for that gesture. Besides, it went out with Mrs. Fiske.
It is true that your parents were poor. They still are. And they would like to know how you are - and where. They haven't heard from you for three years...
That's not true!
I don't suppose there's a drink left...
This must be, at long last, our formal introduction. Until now we have met only in passing...
Feeling better, my dear?
It is senseless to insist that theatrical folk in New York, Hollywood and London are no different from the good people of Des Moines, Chillicothe and Liverpool. By and large, we are concentrated gatherings of neurotics, egomaniacs, emotional misfits, and precocious children-
Margo? Lunching in public?
I distinctly remember striking your name from the guest list. What are you doing here?
Why so remote, Addison? I should think you'd be at the side of your protegee, lending her moral support...
The ladies' - shall we say - lounge?
Naturally enough, your understudy.
Just slipped your mind.
Bill didn't say - but Lloyd was beside himself. He listened to his play as if someone else had written it, he said, it sounded so fresh, so new, so full of meaning...
Bill...
You've already met.
Good luck, genius...
Forty-five minutes from now my plane takes off and how do I find you? Not ready yet, looking like a junk yard-
Is it sabotage, does my career mean nothing to you? Have you no human consideration?
Can't keep his eyes off my legs.
She's quite a girl, that what's-her name...
The lack of pretense, that sort of strange directness and understanding-
Take care of yourself out there...
You're not such a bargain, you know, conceited and thoughtless and messy-
- you're a setup for some gorgeous wide-eyed young babe.
Kid stuff or not, it doesn't happen every day, I want to heat it - and if you won't say it, you can sing it...
Happy little housewife...
Looks like I'm going to have a very fancy party...
I ran into Eve on my way upstairs; she told me you were dressing.
It's a pretty rare quality these days.
I can't believe you're making this up - it sounds like something out of an old Clyde Fitch play...
This is my cue to take you in my arms and reassure you - but I'm not going to. I'm too mad-
Thank you.
Then without feeling, your guests were also wondering whether the music couldn't be a shade more on the - shall we say, happier side?
The audition.
Addison-!
I'm nothing but a body with a voice. No mind.
Such nonsense, what do you all take me for - little Nell from the country? Been my understudy for over a week without my knowing, carefully hidden no doubt-
The playwright doesn't make the performance - and it doesn't just happen! And this one didn't - full of fire and music and whatnot, it was carefully rehearsed I have no doubt, over and over, full of those Bill Sampson touches!
It's obvious you're not a woman.
I wouldn't want you to marry me just to prove something.
I - I don't know, Bill. Just a feeling, I don't know...
To Margo. To my bride-to-be.
Yes, dear.
The Theatuh, the Theatuh-  - what book of rules says the Theater exists only within some ugly buildings crowded into one square mile of New York City? Or London, Paris or Vienna?  Listen, junior. And learn. Want to know what the Theater is? A flea circus. Also opera. Also rodeos, carnivals, ballets, Indian tribal dances, Punch and Judy, a one-man band - all Theater. Wherever there's magic and make-believe and an audience - there's Theater. Donald Duck, Ibsen, and The Lone Ranger, Sarah Bernhardt, Poodles Hanneford, Lunt and Fontanne, Betty Grable, Rex and Wild, and Eleanora Duse. You don't understand them all, you don't like them all, why should you? The Theater's for everybody - you included, but not exclusively - so don't approve or disapprove. It may not be your Theater, but it's Theater of somebody, somewhere.
I read George Jean Nathan every week.
Every day.
- little things here and there, it doesn't matter. You can be proud of yourself, you've got a right to be.
I'll admit I was worried when Max called. I had my doubts.
It was Fort Sumter they fired on-
How do you do, my dear.
She, too, is a great admirer of yours.
Kill the people.  Got your key?
Adorable. We now got everything a dressing room needs except a basketball hoop.
But the wardrobe women have got one. And next to a tenor, a wardrobe woman is the touchiest thing in show business-
You don't like Eve, do you?
An answer.
She's loyal and efficient-
There's some loose characters dressed like maids and butlers. Who'd you call - the William Morris Agency?
What are you doing here?
That's the door.
To speak to just a playwright's wife? I'm the lowest form of celebrity...
Bill Sampson? He's - he's a director.
I'm going to take you to Margo...
I thought you'd forgotten about me.
A part in a play. You'd do all that - just for a part in a play.
Congratulations, Eve.
Back to Copacabana. But Eve. Margo, let me tell you about Eve-
Did you see it here in New York?
Stick around. Please. Tell you what - we'll put Stanislavsky on his plane, you and I, then go somewhere and talk.
I mean the performance. Except for you, you'd think he'd never even directed it - it's disgraceful the way they change everything around...
During your second act scene with your father, Roger Ferraday's supposed to stay way upstage at the arch. He's been coming closer down every night...
You haven't noticed my latest bit of interior decorating...
That's my job.  See you at tea time...
If you'd like.
Well, if you'd been here to begin with, I wouldn't have dared to read at all...
Hi.  Hello, darling-
Relax, kid. It's only me and my big mouth...
Well... there's one indoors now. I've brought her back to see you.
Would you like a drink? It's right beside you...
Karen.  I haven't been pleasant this weekend.
I don't suppose the heater runs when the motor doesn't?
"... my hat which has, lo, these many seasons become more firmly rooted about my ears, is lifted to Miss Harrington. I am once more available for dancing in the streets and shouting from the housetops." ... I thought that one went out with Woollcott...  Down here... here, listen to this- "... Miss Harrington had much to tell - and these columns shall report her faithfully - about the lamentable practice in our Theater of permitting, shall we say - mature - actresses to continue playing roles requiring a youth and vigor of which they retain but a dim memory-"
- 'at's my loyal little woman.
You can't put her out, I promised... Margo, you've got to see her, she worships you, it's like something out of a book-
Coming?
Lloyd, what happened...?
It's just possible she didn't...
It's going to be a cozy weekend.
You know, I've been going over our financial condition - if you'll pardon the expression...
No, I got the idea myself - while she was talking to me...
I'm glad Bill's back.
Well of all-
Have you forgotten about Eve? What she is, what she's done?
I like that girl. That quality of quiet graciousness...
Who's left out there?
Spoken like an author.  Lloyd, I'm not twentyish. I am not thirtyish. Three months ago, I was forty years old. Forty. Four oh.  That slipped out, I hadn't quite made up my mind to admit it. Now I feel as if I'd suddenly taken all my clothes off...
I'm sure you underestimate yourself, Eve. You always do.  You were about to tell me about Eve...
It's been quite a night. I understand that your understudy - Miss Harrington - has given her notice.
... and Bill. Especially Bill. Eve did that, too.
Anything to help you out, Max.
You get quick action, don't you?
She'd be a great help - read scripts, interview people you have to see, get rid of the ones you don't have to... you'd be a man of leisure-
Promise.
Forget it, the main thing--  --did you call me a failure?
And McCord was carrying an application for college press credentials for the Democratic convention.  The Times has got to be full of it-- it can't be crazy Cubans.
Hey?
--what do you think?--
That was fun.  What now?
---fifteen or more phone calls from the burglars in Miami to Gordon Liddy at CREEP--
Were you eyebrow reading?
I hate both parties.
Who'd you vote for?
'68.
Did he just say what I think he said?
--there had to be a White House overseer--
Look--five men controlled that slush fund as CREEP--three of them we've got, Mitchell, Stans, Magruder, and we're pretty sure of Kalmbach.
Goddamnit--
--I want you to shut up and listen to me--
Now the reason no one believed the Republicans is because there wasn't any reason, they were so far ahead. But Segretti was talking to these other lawyers a year before the break- in.
--Jesus--
--jeeeeeeeeesus--
I'd really like to see Mr. Dardis.
Donald Segretti?
I'm Carl Bernstein.  My paper sent me out to see if I couldn't persuade you to go on the record.
According to what we've been able to verify, you've been busy.
Listen--we know you're involved in this--we're going to get the story, why not help?
Tell that to Muskie.
I don't know anything about Haldeman, except, Dwight's frightened of him-- everybody's frightened of him--Christ, I wish I'd never gotten messed around with this--all I wanna do is sit in the sun; sit, swim, see some girls.
Can't help you.
Harry, I just talked to a Miami investigator about Barker--
--you got more than one source?--
--he was going to go into law practice with Segretti.
--and we got a guy in Justice--
You've really got to go.
I was just curious--you don't do it well, so I wondered. Have you been threatened, if you told the truth, is that it?
A lot of it was. I just thought it was sort of an all-purpose political fund--you know, for taking fat cats to dinner, things like that.
I can't be positive that it was used for the break-in but people sure are worried.
It's awfully hot--  --and you haven't finished telling me about the money--
Who by?
Try and understand this. I'm a decent Republican. I believe in Richard Nixon. I worked in the White House four years--so did my wife. What happened on June 17 I don't think the President knew anything about. Some of his men I'm not so sure of.
--that leaves Haldeman, period.
Same kind of crap--
I got Clawsen on hold--
Mr. Rafferty was very helpful. Four Cuban-Americans and this other man, James McCord.
You claiming it was all a misunderstanding, Ken?
Well, was it in a bar, her apartment, some restaurant--
That twenty-five thousand dollars is money I collected for Nixon in this year's campaign.
You thought I'd help out on specifics?  I'll confirm what you get, try to keep you on the right track, but that's all.  Are you guys really working?  How much?
You changed cabs? You're sure no one followed you?
Yes, the little ratfuckers are now running our government.
What?
They know, but they focused on the burglary--if it didn't deal with the break-in, they didn't pursue it.
Why did they do all this for Chrissakes?--what were they after?
--the Canuck letter--was that a White House operation--
Hi, I'm Bob Woodward of the Post and--
I was just kind of wondering why your name and phone number were in the address books of two of the men arrested at Watergate?
Where?
You know, the paper was my father's and my husband's when they were alive and I was thinking back a year or two ago when Ben called me and said he wanted to publish the Pentagon Papers the next day. The Times had already been stopped from publishing anymore of them and all my legal counsel said "don't, don't" and I was frightened but I knew if I said no, I'd lose the whole fifth floor. So we published, and that night, after I'd told Ben to go ahead, I woke up in the darkness and I thought, "Oh my Lord, what am I doing to this newspaper?"  I woke up again last night with that same question.  Are we right on this story?
...go on, go on...
Mr. John Mitchell, the head of CREEP, says it means nothing.  "...This man and the other people involved were not operating on either our behalf or with our consent. These is no place in our campaign or in the electoral process for this type of activity, and we will not forget it or condone it."
What'd you get on W.House?
Who's Colson, Harry?
--in other words, you got nothing, you're thumbsucking.
I can't say anything, I'm sorry. 
--and it wasn't Ehrlichman or Colson or the President.
No, I'm a reporter. I wanted to talk to you about the Committee to Re- Elect.
You work there, Miss Abbott.
What the hell was that?
I'll do it.
Good work, Ostreicher.
Perhaps you should consider actually answering an ad.
Finch, don't you think it's about time you learned to take a dump at school?
Ah, Stifler's mom!  Thank you for letting us have a great party.
...Nevermind.  You have anything to drink?
This is your plan, Finch?
You're gonna shit your pants!
I mean it really bothers me when people try to pigeonhole me like that.
What's your middle name?
Come on!  I won't tell.
Nice car.
What?  No I'm not.
Stifler told me.
There's something I've been meaning to tell you, Heather.
What?  We both have cars.
He likes it.
I -- I don't know, you can't ask me that.
Don't you love my sexy body?!
Fuck me!  Yes!
Alright...I'm shooting for a nine o'clock ETA.  Beer in hand by five after.
What about you?  You're the one with the girlfriend and you're still stranded on third base.
That's what we are, we keep each other on track.  Prior to this day, we've postured.  We've procrastinated. We've pretended.  We've -- well I can't think of other p-words, but we've probably done them too.
Separately, we are flawed and vulnerable.  But together, we are the masters of our sexual destiny!
Hey, where's Finch?
Holy shit.
Yeeeeeeeaaaawwwwww!
What the heck is this?
Jim?
Okay.  Michelle, do you want to be my date for the prom?
You know, at band camp?  We have dances like this.  Only they're way funner.  Don't you think prom is just highly overrated?
So, the end of the story is...you had to kiss the guy for twenty seconds?
Okay, I get it.
Are you gonna do what I think you're gonna do?
You guys got the Latin homework?
Hey, you did better than I did, Nova.
You can do that?
I'll just say that we had a great night together.
Well.  You have seen me.  Now it is my turn to see you.  Strip.
Did you see this?  This is your more exotic dirty magazine.
SUCK ME, BEAUTIFUL!
You're not doing the extra credit problems.
Kevin?  Do you not love me?
And I want to make things perfect for you.  You're right, Kev, we do have something good...and special.
Okay.  Did you bring a condom?
So, do you want to be -- I mean, how do you want to do it?
Kevin, next year...with you in Ann Arbor, and me in Nashville...it's not gonna work, is it.
Have you ever heard of the bible?
Say that again, Kevin?
Then she said -- she loves me.
Contact, dude.
I put in months of quality time with Vicky.  Sherman meets a chick for one night and scores?  This is just wrong.
So, I'm thinking prom is basically our last big chance.
Okay, explain.
NOVA!!
You coming to party tonight, Ostreicher, ya fuckface?
I think you need your balls reattached.
Merde! Just missed!
Look, the more you think about it, the harder it is.
Merde! I can't believe this!
Wow. You know Kung Fu or something?
Ha ha. You were probably right about his mom.
Ahh! Jesus! You're burning hot! What the hell -
Hey, you can't kick me! You're an apparition!
Ha-ha!
You must not have known him very well. He's not like that.
You were. I have work to do. The publisher wants the transcripts by Monday. Go. Make yourself at home.
I'm serious. There's nothing for you down there. It's dangerous.
So you came after all. Just in time, it's getting interesting.
What happened? Did you cut yourself?
Fan-fucking-tastic?
Like I should talk. Monsieur foot-in- the-mouth. I'm really sorry about that whole Woody Allen thing...
Hello?
Andy... I should never have let you go underground. I'm sorry...
What makes you so sure this will work?
I hope they fucking fry us all.
Here! Come on! Do it! Go ahead.
We can't stop him. Not now. Handcuffed, with no kind of weapons. Please Andy...
Didn't even have to ask.
God. I can't believe it.
Pretty stylish digs for a bunch of paupers.
These tunnels must loop around and connect.
It's you. You should be dead in that wreck with Bazin and Racine!
Another step and he's dead!
Psychic awareness. Right.
You're exactly right, Andy. I enlisted both Serafine and your uncle to obtain ADM. And now I'm counting on your assistance too.
I don't believe we've been introduced.
Uncle Terrence.
He's in charge but, uh, between you and me, my English is better.  This way... So you're from New York eh? I love those Hill Street Blues...
Legume? You mean, a vegetable?
What do you mean, maniacs?
Okay. So he's weird. Maybe on drugs. Still, that's not -
No, it's no cure. It's something much more interesting.
Merde.
Here.
I thought you were told not to tutor your servants anymore.
I have to go now, before it gets light.
Is everyone all right?
Did I tell you that?
Oh, Meetoo! You look miserable! Oh, Vlad - look at him!
Poor Meetoo!
I'm going to stretch my legs
Just what do you think you're doing?!
You said you wouldn't laugh!
I know I must have had something to do with the palace - I've had little flashes of things - but being the Princess? It doesn't matter as long as I find my home.
Don't let me go!
I'm getting a chest cold..
I'm getting pneumonia. I have a fever. Feel my forehead...
It's no use, Dmitri - we'll never find the right girl!
What was that?
Wake up, young lady, that's our train.
What do we do now?
The "Odessa Dunk"?
But this invitation came from the Empress herself! It's the social event of the decade! You can't turn it down!
What do you want?!
You're insane! You didn't kill the Romonovs - it was the...
Please, if you'd just listen...
I did no such thing!
Are you impressed with our Anastasia?
Perhaps you could convince her?
What's your name?
You were on... uh, the... uh, the Johnny Carson, right?
Hey!
Not only is he a great agent, but he really gives good meetings.
You didn't read "Death in Venice" till I gave it to you!
Excuse... excuse me, when do I go on?
No, it can't be, because he's a comic.
Yes.
Allison.
We've been through this.
I-I-I-I would leave out the men's- room attendant.
Deal! I'm dealing with two guys named Cheech!
Two minutes, Alvy.
The alarm clock.
I know- because of our sexual problem, right?
Oh!
Alvy, I...
I know, well, it's just that- you know, I mean, I-I-I-I gotta sing tomorrow night, so I have to rest my voice.
Oh, God! Here yuh go! Oh, good, now he'll think-  Aaaah! Okay.
Annie, there's a big lobster behind the refrigerator. I can't get it out. This thing's heavy. Maybe if I put a little dish of butter sauce here with a nutcracker, it will run out the other side, you know what I mean?
It'll make great- Alvy, be- Alvy, it'll be wonderful... Ooooh, lovely!
So, so-well, here's what I wanna know. W-what...  Am I your first big romance?
Oh, come on-I mean, I was still younger.
Uh, you're driving a-
Oh, you do?
You want your tennis stuff?
You're the worst driver I've ever seen in my life... that's including any place... the worst... Europe, United... any place... Asia.
I'll see yuh.
Fifteen years?
Oh, sorry.
Uh, narcolepsy.
Why not?
God bless.
So, did you do shoot the photographs in there or what?
Me? Oh, uh.  No.
Well, I mean, I meet a lot of... jerks, you know-
But I'm thinking about getting some cats, you know, and then they... Oh, wait a second-oh, no, no, I mean  oh, shoot! No, Saturday night I'm gonna-  gonna sing. Yeah.
Whatta you mean, a tad restless? Oh, my God, I mean, they hated me.
Okay?
Here, you want some?
Yeah?
Yeah, 'cause I-I'm, you know, I'm, I'm obsessed with-with, uh, with death, I think. Big-
I don't-don't know how they get through life. It's amazing to me.
There's-there's-there's-there's Mr. When-in-the-Pink, Mr. Miami Beach, there, you know?  He's the latest! just came back from the gin-rummy farm last night. He placed third.
No, I'm not.
You- Do you love me?
I-uh, love is, uh, is too weak a word for what...
Yeah, bu-bu-but why?
Ye-ah. Was it... It was yours actually, but, uh, I approved it immediately.
What are you doing?
Really?
I don't know, but you seem sort of distant.
Oh, you have my body.
M'hm.
Were you always funny?
Well, what is your definition of following?
"Existential Motifs in Russian Literature"! You're really close.
Oh, it was...  really weird. But she's a very nice woman.
M'hm.
Yeah, and he's strangling me...
Well, she said that I should probably come five times a week. And you know something? I don't think I mind analysis at all. The only question is, will it change my wife?
She said, "Will it change my wife." You heard that because you were there so I'm not crazy.
Adult education is such junk! The professors are so phony. How can you do it?
Kill it! For Go- What's wrong with you? Don't you have a can of Raid in the house?
Hey, what am I-your son? Whatta you mean? I-I came over to --
Yeah, where is the spider?
Hey, what is this? You got black soap?
Oh, Jesus, really?
You know I think that if you let me, maybe I could help you have more fun, you know? I mean, I know it's hard and... Yeah.
-me, my God, it's a great day!
Oh, look, look, there's that... that's that's my old house. That's where we used to live.
yes, we had, uh...
What's... you... well, what's the matter, You w-wanna go to that party?
She would not sleep with me the other night, you know, it's-
I mean... I tried everything, you know, I-I-I put on soft music and my- my red light bulb, and...
That's sick!
Excuse me. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Doctor. Uh, Alvy-Alvy, that was the show. They said everything is fine. They found a replacement, so they're going to tape without you.
Christ!
It's wonderful. I mean, you know they just watch movies all day.
Oh, it sure has... You know, you wrote your name in all my books, 'cause you knew this day was gonna come.
Yeah, my analyst thinks this move is keen for me.
Well, why should I put you through all my moods and hang-ups anyway?
Hey, you didn't read "Death in Venice" till I bought it for yuh.
Okay.  Check, please. Can I -can I... Can I... Can I...
You mean that...  I-I-I-I flew three thousand miles to see you.
The Grammys. He's got a lotta records up for awards.
What'd I do?
Here you are. There's people out there.
Hey, come on, it's quiet now. We can- we can start again.
Me? No, no. I-I couldn't make it that ni- My-my raccoon had hepatitis.
Wait a minute, why can't I give my opinion? It's a free country!
Wait a minute! Really? Really? I happen to teach a class at Columbia called "TV Media and Culture"! So I think that my insights into Mr. McLuhan- well, have a great deal of validity.
Ah.
No, I cannot. You keep bringing it up, but I don't wanna live in a city where the only cultural advantage is that you can make a right turn on a red light.
We do the show live in front of an audience.
You all right?
The one with the V.P.L.
If she comes over here, Max, my brain is going to turn into guacamole.
Twins, Max. Sixteen-year-olds. Can you imagine the mathematical possibilities?
Dennis-right, uh, uh... local kid probably, would meetcha in front of the movie house on Saturday night.
Oh, I can imagine. P-p-probably the wife of an astronaut.
Heavy! Eaten by some squirrels.
I have to face facts. I-I adore Alvy, but our relationship doesn't seem to work anymore.
Oh, that Randolph Hunt. You remember Randy Hunt, Annie. He was in the choir with you.
Oh, he's adorable, Annie.
Well, hi!
Well, hey, that's, that's nice. Uh. Oh, listen, this is, uh, Alvy Singer. Do you know Alvy? Uh... and... uh... Tony Lacey.
We just need about six weeks, in about six weeks we could cut a whole album.
There's a whole wing in this house.
Did you know the contractor?
Did you see permits?  Did he have a license?
It has your ring.
She's a constant surprise.
You can cut around it, whatever it is. You always do.
Why didn't you bring him?
You look so well, Clair.  A wraith.
Oh.  Do you have any pictures?
Would you leave us alone right now?
He's gonna miss his flight.
I never put myself in harm's way.
I saw Lucy when I was in London, she seems okay.  It's hard to tell with her.
In Cheyene Walk?  Lucy's going to have a meltdown.  Oh, I'm so sorry.
And?
Let me.  I'm Jeffrey.
Oh yeah?
Damn near.  And a damn near perfect drug.
Just every once in a blue moon, you know.
It was fifteen seconds.
The realtor'll be here tomorrow in the morning.  The house had to go on the market to insure the loan on the London flat.
I worry because you don't.  It's my job. I'm feeling guilty.  I would've liked it if you waited until the two of you were on more solid ground.
We'll be fine.
The Roses?  And of course they said yes.
Whatever you say.
I love you.  Most beautiful woman in the world.
No.  Did you?
I mean, you're really back.
Promise you'll be nice to the neighbors.
It's an unfair advantage.
Okay, knock it off.
What else don't I know about, Joe?  Let's get really clear here.
I'm not sure we understand that word in the same way.
You walked out on a five year marriage.
It is true.  You know how you love, Joe? You dedicate a book to someone.
About me!
I don't look my age, Joe.
I'm a monster.  Exactly.
Don't make allowances.  I'll never be ready.  Some people just shouldn't have children.  I'd be a terrible fucking mother, Joe.  I did want it for us.  But I couldn't do it.  I don't really think I can do it.
That's under lock and key.
I know.
I know.
Don't I find what?
Not long.
Joking.
Something soft.
I'm a little nervous, so...
I don't know why, but these misunderstandings have a way of escalating.
Easy tiger.
Are you okay?
What am I, five?
Nine...nine, yes?  Nine years, just about.
What?
Do you want to go home, Ryan?
What?
Ryan!
Thank you.  I understand you're an interior decorator.
I'm sorry.
I...
Oh my god.  I've been so rude.  I'm Skye Davidson.  Has anyone ever told you, you look like Peter Sellers?
Do you need anything else?
The charades.
Otis you crazy dog!  Otis are you in this God forsaken Canyon?  My people are very hungry.
How about someone who really really liked Shostakovich?
Oh, Jesus, Panes.  I can't, I can't believe that bitch is in my house.
Exactly what I mean.  It's all ruined.
It's our anniversary, Panes.
So how are you really doing, Panes?
Alright.  Well, that's something new.
Well the neighborhood is full of dogs, and it's not always Otis.
I didn't know you had this.
Enough about me.
So where should I put it?
Well good.  Thank God.
No, no, not at all... I mean I've still got plenty of time.  Don't I?  I mean I still have a good six years, whatever. We could have three kids yet, if we wanted.  And I know I've always said I never wanted kids, and I didn't... but this year, I really, truly, feel ready...
His image of you is a possessive, fragile neurotic.
He's...he's dead.  You don't have to look for him anymore.  He was eaten by a praying mantis.
Are you sure this is a real dance?
You dance...
He was a worker.  I danced with him at a <u>worker's bar</u> just the other day. I'm not shocking you, am I?
Excuse me, I --  Pardon me --  And they call them social insects.
Ha!  Don't make me laugh.  You're crazy about me!  That's why you lied and cheated to get near me!
<u>Insectopia</u>?  You stupid worker, that's just a fairy tale!
My skin's dry, my exoskeleton is cracking...I wish I'd never met you, you ruined my life.
We're going to die!
Why didn't I listen to my mother ...why'd I have to go looking for trouble? Any ant would have given their left legs to be in my position...what's <u>wrong</u> with me?
Z...if we don't make it...I just want you to know....
Come on, Z.
Of course --
Of course not --
Bala!
You new, kid?
You just stick by old Barbatus. He'll watch out for you.  Whatsamatter, kid?  Leave a girl behind?
No -- we're going to attack the termites!
No, no, you're...lookin' good. You've got good color in your cheeks.
Barbatus, hang on -- Barbatus!!
Fourteen-fifty hours, sir.
What do we have on this "Insectopia"?
What are you doing?!  ATTACK!!  Come on, you yellow-bellies!  Don't just stand there, Carpenter! Make an example of yourself!
Lays it on a little thick, doesn't he?  If you ask me, he's one giant bore.
What's this?  A <u>worker</u> has been masquerading as a war hero?!
...I should?
You bet!  They'll really go for a sensitive guy like you!
Such a racket I heard in your place -- maybe you had burglars.
Ma'am?
You wouldn't have such a thing as a napkin, would you?
All right -- I'll tell him.  Hey, Baxter -- that was Personnel. Mr. Sheldrake's secretary.
What gives, Baxter? You getting promoted or getting fired?
Oh, I never catch colds.
Good night.
Oh -- Miss Kubelik.  I've been waiting for you. FRAN You have?
No.
You mean tonight?
I wasn't trying to be personal -- it's just that the fellows in the office were -- whether you wondering about you ever --
Well, in that case, couldn't you -- ?
Well, it was just an idea -- I hate to see a ticket go to waste --
What gave you that idea?
Well, as a matter of fact, I was rather hurt when you stood me up that night --
Maybe if I wore it a little more to the side --  is that better?
I understand. Christmas -- family and all that --
Oh, you don't have to worry about that. I have quite a bit of influence in Personnel. You know Mr. Sheldrake?
Your phone.
Miss Kubelik, I'm stronger than you are --
Who are you calling, Miss Kubelik?
You better figure it out -- exactly. Suppose she asks you why you didn't come home last night?
Oh, you're wrong. He told me --
I think I'm going to give it all up.
That's me with men. I've been jinxed from the word go -- first time I was ever kissed was in a cemetery.
What for?
Do I have to?
Are you all right?
What are you doing with that?
I know so. He's a taker.
Some people take, some people get took -- and they know they're getting took -- and there's nothing they can do about it.
You can't leave yet. The doctor says it takes forty-eight hours to get the stuff out of your system.
Well, maybe not exactly -- I tried to do it with a gun.
Uh-huh. While I was sitting there, trying to make my mind up, a cop stuck his head in the car, because I was illegally parked -- so I started to hide the gun under the seat and it went off -- pow!
Yeah. Took me a year before I could bend my knee -- but I got over the girl in three weeks. She still lives in Cincinnati, has four kids, gained twenty pounds -- she sends me a fruit cake every Christmas.
Oh, no. Sometimes I have dinner with Ed Sullivan, sometimes with Dinah Shore or Perry Como -- the other night I had dinner with Mae West -- of course, she was much younger then.  Cheers.
You know what we're going to do after dinner?
We're going to finish that gin game.
Oh, Miss Kubelik. How do you feel?
How's everything at the apartment?
Oh.
No. You know how people talk. So I decided it would be better if we didn't see each other till everything is settled, divorce-wise.
Oh -- Mrs. Lieberman.
Been hearing some very nice things about you -- here's a report from Mr. Dobisch -- loyal, cooperative, resourceful --
And Mr. Kirkeby tells me that several nights a week you work late at the office -- without overtime.
Tell me, Baxter -- just what is it that makes you so popular?
What -- what's that got to do with me? I'm not running any bookie joint.
Sir?
It also says here -- that you are alert, astute, and quite imaginative --
Not that I have anything to hide.
So it was.  She threw it at me.
Put me down for Thursday again.
I thought maybe you'd like to be here when she wakes up.
Sir?
Especially not Miss Kubelik.
Now, wait a minute. I know what you're thinking -- but it's not as bad as it looks -- MATUSCHKA  It's none of my business what you do, Fran -- you're over twenty- one -- but your sister happens to think you're a lady.
No, no -- just had a little accident.
Good morning, Mr. Kirkeby.
A lot of guys around here have tried it -- all kinds of approaches -- no dice.  What is she trying to prove?
Baxter, we're a little disappointed in you -- gratitude-wise.
Say, why don't we have ourselves a party -- the four of us?
Hiya, Buddy-boy.  I'm in this bar on Sixty-first Street -- and I got to thinking about you -- and I figured I'd give you a little buzz.
We went to bat for you -- and now you won't play ball with us.
Dear Mr. MacIntosh --  Vanderhof, Public Relations. Oh, yes, Baxter. Just a minute.  All right, Miss Finch -- type up what we got so far.  Now what is it, Baxter?
That's not like you, Baxter. Just the other day, at the staff meeting, I was telling Mr. Sheldrake what a reliable man you were.
Good evening, Baxter.
Sometimes,  there's a twi-night double-header.  A nebbish like you!
She'll sleep on and off for the next twenty-four hours. Of course, she'll have a dandy hangover when she wakes up --
Yeah, wasn't I?
You know me with girls. Easy come, easy go. Goodbye, Doc.
That so.
Who is Mickey?
Family?
What's the matter? Did I do something wrong?
Do you know where you are, Fran?
You fool -- you damn fool.
Hi. How's the branch manager from Kansas City?
Still afraid somebody may see us together?
That's right.
How long has it been -- a month?
I missed you, Fran.
I don't believe you.
You're not giving me a chance, Fran. I asked you to meet me because -- I have something to tell you. FRAN Go ahead -- tell me.
Fran -- remember that last weekend we had?
You're not being funny.
I'm sure. If you'll just tell me that you still love me --
Now, Fran --
A hundred dollars? I wouldn't call that cheap. And you must be paying somebody something for the use of the apartment --
Coming?
He wouldn't give me the key to the apartment.
What are you talking about?
Sylvia -- sweetie -- it's not that -- but I promised the guy I'd be out of here by eight o'clock, positively.
Stay with it, Buddy-boy!  Come on, Sylvia.
Me? SHELDRAKE Thank you for giving that little pep talk to Miss Kubelik at the office party.
Maybe we should send up two flies -- and see if they'll propagate in orbit.
No -- absolutely not --
Two whole drums --
We've been attacked.
Moonby what?
Delta ?
Were you Longe Range Recon --
Yeah.
How long were you up there ?
A sauciere --
Captain -- they've been probed all this week -- Cong and NVA regulars. There's gonna be a big offense any time.
What are we doing here?
This is evil -- evil, Captain. We're all gonna die here.
Flood.
I met the P.B.R. crew; they were pretty much all kids, except for Phillips, the Chief -- Gunner's Mate Third Class L. Johnson -- Lance Johnson; Gunner's Mate Third Class J. Hicks -- The Chef -- Radio Operator Second Class T. Miller; they called him Mr. Clean.
The Delta closes off to us about ten  miles out of Hau Fat. We'll be able to pick up some supplies -- bit I think there are only two points we can draw enough water to get into the Nung River. It's all Charlie's turf from there on out.
Smoke !
Yeah, Chef -- go ahead -- take Lance with you --
Careful,  Captain, they've been known to charge.
Well, get in there.
Who knows? Right.
What cat  ?
Jesus -- that guy's too damn much.
Our Recon flight ?
Do me a favor buddy, please.
It's to everyone I really knew -- the first girl I screwed -- my brother -- best friend -- I wanted to tell 'em how much I enjoyed knowing 'em -- it's been a great twenty years. I gotta let 'em know.
How did they know?
You know much about about Special Forces; Green Berets, Captain ?
Fifty calibers, eh, Captain --
American weapons?
We don't want to bother you any, we --
Attacks repulsed, as I was saying.  This is only  for this war, Captain. Viet Cong -- 54; North Vietnamese regular forces -- 15; South Vietnamese -- 28 -- regular forces and otherwise.  Americain -- 6. Of course, they were, perhaps, mistakes, Captain.
What's your name, sailor ?
Lance Johnson? The surfer?
They far enough?
What do you mean?
Why the hell didn't you tell me about that place -- a good left.  There aren't any good left slides in this whole, shitty country. It's all goddamn beach break.
Why the hell you wanna go up to Nu Mung Ba for?
What'd you do for supplies?
Can you trust them?
I mean it's hairy -- they got some pretty heavy ordnance, boy -- I've lost a few recon ships in there now and again.
You talk like him. I don't mind taking casualties, Captain, but I like to keep my ratio ten to one in this unit -- ten Cong to one.
We'll come in low out of the rising sun -- We'll put on the music about a mile out.
I'm waiting for the fucking boat, Colonel.
Do you?
You've gone crazy.
Yes...
Did you know him very well?
This one , Lance?
You think he'd of shot us?
You don't know how happy that makes me, sir.
I'd just clear out as soon as I could if I were you, sir. They're gonna start working on the bridge with torches again. Charlie will start throwing it in hard --
Cognac?
What will you do after the war?
What's a big question?
Yes.
That strange things.. terrible things have occured around this American, Kurtz.
Did you know -- deeper in the jungle, upriver -- there are savages?
Well who the hell verifies that ?
This -- Bob Hope or the like --
What?

Watch it with Meyerling.  Man's as mean and corrupt as they get. Cut his mother's throat if it'd get him a couple votes.
My dad was a Navy doctor.
Oh.
-- Get this straight: I'm the District Supervisor.  Whatever you do reflects on me.  It wasn't my idea to bring you people up here, but I'm stuck with you. You are absolutely not to involve yourself in any local disputes. Whichever side you take, you alienate the other.  Mr. Corbett is quite well-known in this region.  People admire him --
I still can't believe I'm being financed by an oil company. Especially when they get a look at these pictures.  Technology in the wilderness; not too pretty.  What's that?
Oh, Christ, sweetheart.  Four days!  I thought you were dead, or worse.
Where's Corbett?
Technology in the wilderness. Only problem is talking to you on your way to the landing strip.
Go ahead.  Take the jeep.  I'll come to Cache with Bob when he gets here.
Six months.  Ecological study for Northland Oil.
Surviving is what I know --
Sounds like professional jealousy.
With light clothing and no supplies, this is nobody's territory.
We'll stop here, dig out a snow shelter.
Nome?  I figure you'd be a whaler, coming from there.
Don't push me..!
Answer and I'll shoot!
You wouldn't shoot anyone...
I'm not too old to knock the snot out of you!
What's wrong?
You don't care enough about Sam to --
What'd you say they call these spaceships?
Why the smirk?
Dead.  Trappers killed him.
It's a three-hour flight.  They shoulda got there yesterday.
I didn't know you had a secret admire.
C-o-n-s-c-i-e-n-c-e. I got Sean from the bakery to baby-sit so let's go out.
Spencer is okay. You'd better start finding something else to do with your free time. If you can't feel good about this break and step out a little...  You ought to get Mr. Udall to send you over a psychiatrist.
I don't know... It's very strange not feeling that stupid panic thing inside you all the time. Without that you just start thinking about yourself -- and what does that ever get anybody. Today, on the bus there was this adorable couple and I felt myself giving them a dirty look -- I had no idea everything was...
What is it you want? What?
Stop it!! Why can't I have a normal boyfriend??? Why? Get out of here. Just a regular boyfriend who doesn't go nuts on me...
Do you love me?
Not your name...  what are you telling me your name for!! Where is he?
Only in the emergency room or when he was well.
They haven't done the standard scratch test. Where they make small injections into the skin?
No. Actually, I think that's their technical name.
Doc!!!  So listen, you gotta let me know about the additional costs -- one way or the other we'll...
What's with the plastic picnic ware? Why not try ours...  afraid it isn't clean?
Just give yourself a little pep talk. "Must try other people's clean silverware as part of the fun of dining out."
Sorry.
This is not a sexist thing. If you were a waiter I would still be here saying...
I am trying to keep emotions out of this. Even though this is an important issue to me and I have strong feelings about the subject.
What about your mother?
Yeah, yeah...  any chance you'll get back to work today?
That's not why I'm here...  ...  though you have no idea what it's like to have a real conversation with a doctor about Spencer...
What needs clearing up?
I'm not kidding.
Okay.
Melvin... I'd like to know exactly where we are going.
Hey -- you let him...
That monominute somebody gets that you need them they threaten to go away. Never fails.
That's why you brought me? Look at me! Is that really why you brought me... Like I'm a what and I owe you what?!
I'll never forget you said it.
Nothing like no choice to make you feel at home.
That seems like a good choice.
Boyfriend?
I don't know the last time I've been out of the city... Hey, my arms are tanning. I used to tan great. We gotta stop soon so'se I can check on Spencer.
Can you not be violent?
How to die, mostly.
I haven't even been thinking about sketching for weeks.
Explain to me how you can diagnose someone as "obsessive compulsive disorder" and then act like I have any choice in barging in.
You changed the room around...
So, what's new anyway? How's Verdell?
How could you do that? He'll hurt him.
I'm sorry that I'm not taking you.
You're taking him...  yes...  you're taking him -- this will clear the books. One night. You want to say "no" to me? Try...  because I've never felt as nuts as I do right this second. I almost want you to try saying "no."
Hey, where are you going? You can't do this.  I can't take a dog.  Nobody's ever been in here before.
Yeah, but it's all about Simon now... you helped with the dog... And now there are other things. I'm just as concerned as you are about Simon.
Shall I get her for you?
My dog... you know... I mean my little dog with the adorable face... Don't you know what my dog looks like?
Which color was that?
Did you... do something to him?
That's some face they left hanging on you. You look like...
Go away.
Well, I'll do one thing for you that might cheer you up.
Now we'll both call him.
I brought you Chinese soup.
I haven't been sleeping. I haven't been clear or felt like myself. I'm in trouble. Some son of a bitch is burning my bridges behind my back...  But the tiredness -- boy...  Not just sleepy.
... Now he's going to want to stay. And they'll want to take a ride to the lake or whatever. So it's a good five hours back. It gives us a chance to take it easy and...
Good-bye.  Well, your luck is holding. They sublet your place. You're homeless. Frank's got a line on another place you can use for now.
Because...  ... you love her?
Picking on me won't help.
What's wrong?
How do you write women so well?
Exactly what is your previous experience?
Nothing. I just watch till something strikes me. Do anything you think of -- try different thing. Until I say, "hold that pose." Then just try and comfortably hold it.
Is there a problem?
Uh, Fontella's
Yeah.
What are you doing?
Yeah well, you just blew your tip, pal.
Sit back.  Put your seatbelt on.
Boy, that's fucking genius.  You're a fucking genius.  Then you're just sitting there, bullshitting with me. Man, no way I coulda done that!
Okay.
How'd you know?  Just tell me that. How'd you fucking know?
You don't know a fucking thing about me.  You don't have the slightest fucking clue.
Michael?
Send the file.  I'll have the estimate tonight.
What?
I give a fuck?  I'm done!  I quit! Do you fucking hear me!  I'm fucking gone!
Now what?
You want me to pump?
You don't know that -- you're trying to scare me.
What I'm trying to say is that -- I'm not sure I can do this, help you, unless I know more about you.
Had?
Yes.  As soon as you get into this business, all you can think about is getting to the top.  That's all there is.  Until then, there is nothing.  You are nothing.
The same way everyone does; the government, the Agency.
Languages.  I was already fluent in nine languages.
Some people said that.  I never thought so.
I was just different.
My first take?
It.  Tell it.  For all I know it could be a machine.
Do you have a passport?
It helps me to focus.  It centers me, helps me think.
Do you think about the game?
Do you think he's here?
I've always wanted to learn something like that.
He can't.  The bank has an expensive security system; metal detectors and X-ray machines.
What?
I told you, he will.
I don't believe that.
It was no big deal.  I saw them leave, I went in.
Isn't it interesting though?  I mean, look at us, in this room.  Or yesterday, when we were walking in the plaza market.  I mean, we look like just another couple.  But what are we?  Doesn't it seem so crazy?
He told me that my curiosity became unnaturally entangled with my sense of self-preservation.
Yes.
Attraction is a complication?
Who was she?
I waited another four minutes.
Was nice.
I wasn't watching television.
I thought it was interesting --
Hi.  Did you call --
I prefer it like this.
That's okay, hon, I always expect the unexpected.
But when you finLsh a job, afterwards do you think about them?
Do you ever think about starting over?
How much farther?
Funny, I've never been a talker. My wife was always getting on me about that.  'Say what you feel, tell me what's bothering you, you ve got to talk to me.'  I never would though.  Not really.
One hundred thousand?  That's it? Jesus... Is that a lot?
I don't know. It's kind of underground. Doug's right, there's too much crap in this town.
What is it with that Josh guy? Who does he think he is shoving that Reflections rag down our throats?
Because it's in English?
Inspirations a fickle thing, you don't realise you had it till it's gone.
It all comes down to ideology and they've lost theirs. If I'd been here ten years ago, maybe they wouldn't be in the mess they are today.
Just because they've got a choice of four McDonalds, doesn't mean they can afford a cheeseburger.
Squatted it.
Puppet theatre, don't you need something a little bigger?
No, but like my dad said, "There's only so many ways you can wire a plug".
I feel like a mole in this joint, so I guess I might as well come out lookin' like one!
Well, don't get carried away.
Oh yeah, what's my connection to that?
No way, it's sealed - if she's in there she's dead.
Close!
What's that, five instead of ten years jail.
Like a hand?
Red or white?
No, We aren't going to do it.
Thanks. Come on Chris, give me a hand.
My God! What happened?
Does Jahn's thing have a name?
Huh?
They're good guys..... Have you seen Holly?
Damn!
Yeah. I tell you, they're one big happy family over there.
Well, the trial's in two weeks, but I think they've already sentenced me. They just need to check if Siberia can slot me in.
You know, there is one thing I can't figure out. All along they've been bugging me about those files and when I told them I'd burned all that stuff, they went nuts - they told the Consul guy they were medical records?
Maybe, but I've started to wonder what those files were all about. Suppose it was old KGB stuff and had the dirt on big people or maybe the personnel records of the secret police, that might explain all the hassle and the cover-up.
God, I think I need a holiday.
Time for lunch I think. I'll get the sandwiches. What would you like Holly?
Yeah, no problem.
I can't go with him.
You don't understand, I can't!
I made a deal with Josh.
It was a condition of getting Doug out.
You mean, Josh's father had nothing to do with it?
Well, he should be on his way back to his apartment by now.
Take this exit.
There shooting at something.
Your home address is 18 Thornton Avenue, Coventry.
Now, have you been read your rights and are you aware of the charges?
Before you go, did you get those bruises here?
Hey, Lawrence how are you doing mate?
Well, get me and Chris a drink then.
But I don't want to go, I am enjoying it.
Doug you said you wouldn't be long. Come on, I've got to go. Now!
I hope you're going to invite me in?
I want you so bad. She'll be asleep soon, maybe we could do it quietly under the sheets.
No, I love you, really.
Yes, The Obelisk but it's closed for repairs.
No thanks, I must go, but maybe you could get some beers for the guys.
It is okay........We will paint the wood black, yes?
You mean you don't know, Henry! We got a bunch of anarchists, controlling a six-level block of luxury apartments down on Janovska street here in the Old Town, and you don't know about it?
Henry, these guys already push most of the drugs in this town and now they want to move into pornography, right? Believe me, it won't stop there either, next it'll be a church and pretty soon they'll have their own department store or something...... Henry, we've got to stop them. The foundation's got to put an end to it!
No act of love but willing violence demanded by one and begged by the other. As life turned to fantasy and reality to ecstasy a need, so deep no light could reach, surfaced like a nocturnal creature unearthed for momentary and glorious display. Left alone in a rose-tinted afterglow dimming fast she tasted the moisture of her body and wondered why light came to day and such desires to her pale-skin body.
Why are you doing all this, what for?
I figured you more as a Socialist?
A champion of lost causes huh?
Don't you have a girlfriend?
This is your doing?
What was the real purpose behind this venture?
I'm not sure it's possible.
And the students?
Central station, locker number 139 - combination JFK.
Great, let's break for lunch and I'll buy you a beer on the way.
So, he didn't fire you?
When the hell did you write that?
You are quite sure it's secure?
What are you an idiot!
So, who is in the building?
And there has been enquiries from the American Embassy maybe they are involved?
What if his accomplices have made copies?
She's coming over here...
Pictures from the play. Jamie looks pretty --
What if they expel you?
Why not?
You look nice. I should have dressed.
You do. You're handsome and charming.
That's eight years of school and training -- after college. And all that doesn't necessarily make you a better human being.
Now it's okay?
Everything's being done but it's not enough. I have to find something -- more.
Don't call him a dipshit.
Deranged.
You.
Get yourself a glass.
'Is it really me?'
Get very wasted. Lose your virginity --
You're really into God, right?
Like in a church painting. I see this giant hovering over the ground. He's wearing a robe, and has long flowing hair, and he's pointing his finger at something.
Maybe you inspire me.
I don't want to be just your friend --
What does that mean?!
Hey.
Yes. But not as a date date.
It's only 7:30.
It's about working with what you already have -- right now -- at your fingertips -- you know, spontaneously.
You make me feel...
Here. Why am I looking at this star?
Jamie --
Help me live until I die?
Whatever you need. Whatever Jamie needs. I'm here.  I could start by driving her to school --
Will you do something for me?
But if you could, you would?
The Carter boy. Tell me about him.
By accident --
I'm supposed to always be alone?
What's Landon Carter up to?
Boys like him have -- expectations.
Maybe. But that's not the real reason. You think if I tell, he'll disappear and that's what you want! Me all to yourself!
Apropos of nothing... so. So so so so --
I'd like to take Jamie to dinner on New Year's Eve.
Landon. You're not the quiet type.
How about your family?
Since I was five. My mom's a cocktail waitress.
Landon. You go on home.
I've almost finished the rocker. Did she order mirrors?
You've been well?
You could grace our hallowed halls again, if, while you're here, you make a sincere effort to be part of our little school community --
For Jefferson High. For books.
It's mine to give. I didn't steal it.
This is 1952....?
Then you'll be going to school here....?
Hi, Marty!
Now, George! Dinner's ready now!
What do I say?
Huh?
'Bike fine point?'
You're not picking a fight, you're coming to her rescue. Maybe we'd better go over the plan again. Where are you gonna be at 8:55?
You mean, you're gonna --
Your line, George!
Maybe if I used my left....
You'd like to see a nuclear holocaust?
You know damn well that's not what I meant.
What, am I radioactive or something?
Okay, Martin. You have a good evening now.
What?!
Pro, the sun's out!
All I know is you're throwing away an awful lot of money.
You've convinced me that you must be who you say you are. No living human has ever seen this machine.  But why? Why even in my twilight years would I remotely consider sending someone back in time?
On second thought, there may be some things you'll have to tell me.
4200 rads...  That certainly can't be generated under controlled conditions in this day and age.
I told you not to interfere with any of the events of this time! Nobody's supposed to see you here! What if I was a mailman? Or a salesman?
I am serious. If we could get you, the time machine, and the power converter in the vicinity of an atomic blast, we could send you back to the future.
Say, where did this guitar come from?
I know.
My guess is that she turned him down.
Apparently, what has happened is that the maternal instinct has transcended the gap of time and this has caused an alteration in your mother's emotional behavior.
You didn't?
Hop in, Marty, . We've got a long drive ahead of us.
Me neither. I've always wondered whether they slept together before they got married. You think yours did?
Catch!
You lost that one?
What kind of work do you think you would be qualified for?
Kit... Kit, I've got a question for you.
Well, Kit...
What for?
Okay.
Doing what?
That's my father. I got to run.
Can I be honest?
Well, that I shouldn't be seen with anybody that collects garbage.
Quit my job.
Yeah, well, I'm going to work as a cowboy now... Or thinking about it. It's a routine, like anything. What do you think?
Anybody ever call you "Red"?
Is he upset?
Whatcha looking in there for? We can't afford any of that.
What'd you put him in there for?
No.
Why not? I mean, I'm having fun... At least I'm not bitching.
Maybe we should've tried to hop it.
I could've pulled the car up on the tracks, slowed it down some.
Well, maybe the slope here is throwing it off some. We ought to find a more flat place.
Never mind. It doesn't matter... If I'm worth a damn, I'll pick the right direction. And if I'm not, well, I don't care. See what I mean?
What's that?
Good deal... Oh, uh, we're on the run and we'd like to hang out here for a while. Couple of hours, maybe. How'd that be?
See, we're about out... been driving all night. Actually, I don't even have time to explain it to you.
So we'll help.  Let's get crackin'!
November 1, thirty days have September, April, June, and November...when short February's done, all the rest have thirty-one. October 31st!  Halloween!  Don't you get it?  Orson Welles!
Halloween. 1938..."War of the Worlds"...that fake radio news broadcast that got everybody scared, thinking that real live Martians were landing in Grover's Mill, New Jersey!  But then it all just turned out to be a hoax.
We at the Banzai Institute have at last found that way: an alternating gradient synchronizer that softens solid matter by attenuating its electroweak forces!
Dr. Lizardo's a raving lunatic, Perfect Tommy, a vicious psychopath with crazy eyes and flaming orange hair that once upon a time was mousy brown like yours.
Go back to the bus and reroute the call.
We will, old fried, we will.
Dead.  Damnit!
These antidote filters the Professor's whipped up will let you to see them like I have since yesterday, as arachtoidal creatures. They won't be pretty, nothing personal, John Parker.  But just remember...if we fail tonight, there's no tomorrow.
We're going down!  Onto the runway!
And there's a two-hundred-dollar deductible we have to eat on that crack in her windshield.
...where there was some kinda giant crash landing, a huge explosion and they fooled Orson Welles into covering it up!  And then they founded Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems and hid there for...
Raise your hand...where?
Did you say..."Peggy"?
What're you doing here? Why're you looking at me like that?
The girl I remind you of.
Adopted.  I should have know. Of course. If it was a snake, it'd bit me!
Yes, I do.  Gimme a chance.  I'm stronger than you think.
Please, Penny.  You just gotta trust me now.  Okay?  And don't panic. Because it's gonna be all right.
Yeah...and maybe more important, if you believe in yourself.
I'm not worth it, Buckaroo! Forget me!
Jammed--? By who? Whom by?
How long you been riding with Buckaroo, Reno?
What's his problem?
Better see what's keepin' the boss, Reno.
Now twenty seconds downrange...Perfect Tommy, how on earth is Buckaroo able to keep that thing on the ground?
I'll tell Bill you dropped by. I'm sure he'll want to reschedule your appointment.
Perhaps the three of us, Mr. Fink.
Let him go.
Pick it up... Pick it up. Pick it-
Before what?
Well, Bill was ALWAYS the author, so to speak-
If I close m'eyes I can almost smell the live oak.
...This'll sometimes help.
So now I'm s'posed to roll over like an ol' bitch dog gettin' ger belly scratched.
Barton, I'm afraid it's not a good time-
How d'ya like your room!
...Hello.
No, I – I didn't mean to sound –
Ever talk to him?
...No. I never saw him with anyone else.
Well that's what he said.
Goddamn voices... DROWN 'EM!
I'm a writer, Mr. Geisler. Ted Okum said I should drop by morning to see you about the –
I'm a writer. Ted Okum said you're producing this Wallace Beery picture I'm working on.
On the Beery picture! Where are we? Wuddya got?
Getting STARTED! Christ Jesus! Started?!  You mean you don't have ANYthing?!
Understand shit! I though you were gonna consult another writer on this!
Bill Mayhew! Some help! The guy's a souse!
What do you do far a living?
Fair enough. No pressure here, Barton, because I respect you, but let me point out a couple of things. One, here you make a difference to five hundred fifty people a night – if the show sells out.  Eighty five million people go to the pictures every week.
...I guess I'm sprouting off again. But I am certain of this, Garland: I'm capable of more good work. Maybe better work than I did in Choirs. It just doesn't seem to me that Los Angeles is the place to lead the life of mind.
...Barton, is everything okay?
Yeah, just a nip. I feel like hell, all the carryings-on next door.
...In spite of what you might think from tonight, I'm pretty good at it.
Hell yes. Because I believe in it. Fire, theft, and casualty are not things that only happen to other people – that's what I tell 'em. Writing doesn't work out, you might want to look into it. Providing for basic human need – a fella could do worse.
That's okay, Charlie. I'm a playwright. My shows've only played New York. Last one got a hell of a write-up in the Herald. I guess that's why they wanted me here.
Well, I don't mean to get up on my high horse, but why shouldn't we look at ourselves up there?  Who cares about the Fifth Earl of Bastrop and Lady Higginbottom and – and – and who killed Nigel Grinch-Gibbons?
Exactly, Charlie! You understand what I'm saying – a lot more than some of these literary types. Because you're a real man!
Sure you could!  And yet many writers do everything in their power to insulate themselves from the common man – from where they live, from where they trade, from where they fight and love and converse and – and – and... so naturally their work suffers, and regresses into empty formalism and – well, I'm spouting off again, but to put it in your language, the theater becomes as phony as a three dollar bill.
You're all right, Charlie. I'm glad you stopped by. I'm sorry if – well I know I sometimes run on.
...What's the expression – me myself and I.
...This must be boring you.
Nope, never watched any. I'm not that interested in the act itself –
...You're a little out of your weight class, but just for purposes of demonstration –
How did you know about that?
Yeah, but –
...Ah, you'll lick this picture business, believe me. You've got a head on your shoulders. What is it they say? Where there's a head, there's a hope?
You're leaving?
I'm truly sorry to hear that, Charlie. I'll miss you.
So they say.
Are you sure –
Why don't we go to your room-
...Will you stay with me till they get here?
Hold on. Stop. Take a deep breath. Tell me what happened.
Jesus... You're leaving.
Jesus, Charlie, I...
It's okay... It's okay...
It's more than I've got.
But Charlie – why me? Why –
...Where did we put him?
...Can I be honest, Mr. Lipnik?
...I was commissioned yesterday in the Army Reserve. Henry Morgenthau arranged it. He's a dear friend.
Actually it hasn't officially gone through yet. Had wardrobe whip this up. You gotta pull teeth to get anything done in this town. I can understand a little red tape in peacetime, but now it's all-out warfare against the Japs. Little yellow bastards.  They'd love to see me sit this one out.
...I gotta tell you, Fink. It won't wash.
I'm sorry if I let you down.
Welcome to the Hotel Earle. May I help you, sir?
F-I-N-K. Fink, Barton. That must be you, huh?
...Are you a tranz or a rez?
Okey-dokey, go ahead.
...Those your only bags?
Is this multiple choice?
...Yeah, he... he lives next door to me.
What did... What did he –
Big fuckin' deal.
Started in Kansas City. Couple of housewives.
Why's it so goddamn hot out here?
We got a treatment on it yet?
...Maybe we should do a treatment.
Take care, you hear?
The boat blew.  There was a leak in the gas line.  There were two previous repairs.  There was a five-mil policy on both of 'em.  A real heavy investigation.  Zilch. Goose-egg.  It was an accident.
I can get my butt kicked for this. You're not supposed to be in here.
Hey, that's Dr. Gardner, isn't it?
Yes.
You okay?
Catherine Tramell.
Beth.  I didn't mean what I said. About --
What is this interest you've got in her?
I did dye my hair.  It didn't have anything to do with her.  I was a redhead for a while, too.
Put your fucking hands up!  Don't move.
How long were you dating him?
Did you go home with him?
Was there anyone with you last night?
Ms. Tramell, we'd like you to come downtown and answer some questions for us.
Yes, you do.
You like playing games, don't you?
But you didn't hurt --
Even though you were fucking him.
Would you like a drink?  I was just going to have one.
I'd like to ask you a few more questions.
I didn't.
Jack Daniel's okay?  It's gonna have to be.
Cheers.  My friends call me Catherine.
Did you think it was so special?
How about Roxy?  Is she a fuck to the century, too?
How's your shoulder?
Are you kidding?  You think this is my idea of morning-after conversation?
You're in over your head.
Maybe she got jealous of Johnny Boz, too.
About three months before I met you.
I'd read about your shootings in the papers.  I decided to write a book about a detective.  I wanted to know my character.
I would've paid more.  I wanted to know everything about you.  Then you came down here after Johnny got killed... it gave me a chance to get to know my character better.
Do you believe me?
What did he say?
Can I talk to you a minute?
You're not going to tell me what she's doing.  I thought we weren't playing games anymore.
You still think I kill people, don't you?
I finished my book.
What do you want, Nick?  Flowers? I'll send you some flowers.
What do we do now, Nick?
Who was this fuckin' guy?
Ain't that cute?  They got his and her Pig-assos, son.
What's goin' down, son?
What in the hell for?  You think I'm gettin' any at my age?  I don't like blue-haired women.  I don't like 'em.
Come on, I'll drive you in this thing.
Catherine says you don't like her.
How did she know Nilsen knew about it -- if it happened?
Goddamn writers -- all they do is use up trees and ruin people's eyes.  There's gotta be somebody at Berkeley who knows what the hell happened.
Where the hell you goin'?
When was the last time you saw John Boz?
What was the motive?
He left the club with his girlfriend about midnight.  That's the last time anybody saw him.
What is all this "Nick" stuff -- Nick would you like a cigarette. Nick can you give me a ride.
How did they die?  Was there an investigation?
I.A.'s going to talk to you more about Nilsen.  They're handling the investigation, we're not. Stay in touch with Dr. Gardner, it'll help on the evaluation.
Beth?  Now you've got Beth killing people?
You knew her, didn't you?
We're sorry to disturb you, we'd like to ask you some --
Yes I did.
He died -- about five or six years ago.
My name is Jean Michel Basquiat. Have you heard of me?
Is this finished yet?
Andy, man, thanks for coming. I'd like to paint your jacket.
Everybody's paying top dollar for scraps of paper, refrigerator doors – anything with a SAMO tag on it.  The other day, I just wanted a pack of cigarettes, so I did a drawing and sold it for two bucks. A week later this gallery calls me up: "Somebody's offering us the drawing. Should we buy it for five thousand?"
When?
Tom and Cynthia Kruger.
Do you think I could borrow your limousine? I'll get it back to you in an hour.
I hear your show was sold out already. There's a very important collector who's interested in some of your works.
What are they?
Oh, that's a "Leonardo's Greatest Hits" painting. You like it?
I use a lot of colors – not only black.
Not what?
Hmmmm. Interesting. And when you grew up were there any primitives hanging in your home?
It's Andy again.
"She loves me. Oh yeah she loves me! She loooooooves me, Oh yeah she loves me!" Bring me some chicken, baby!
Come on, Jean. Get rid of your cigarette. Concentrate.
You're shattering all my myths.
What're you doing? You're doing something.
Willie Mays!!! Willie Mays!!!
No, don't tell me – you just got fired by your crazy boss.
You're back.
I'm your family.
... babies.
What's that?
Forget it .I'll take six, no, seven chocolate shakes, an order of fries, a Big Mac, and two apple pies.
I really... admire you.
I've seen you before. I like your paintings a lot. Your hair was different.
See you later.
I don't eat junk food.
You see? You have someone to live for.
What? What do you want?
You heard of Albert Milo. I made that niggah. I'm Rene Ricard. Didn't you read "Not About Albert Milo?" I know who to hype. Baby, I'm gonna make you a star.
Uh huhh... Band practice?  It's Benny. He wants to know why you're not at band practice...?
You fucking little whore! You sold my painting! I'm gonna tell you something, brother – when you're climbing up the ladder of success, don't kick out the rungs! Believe that shit.
You nuts? Let him order? You on his side? You're not such a good waitress. You get out, too.
Uh-oh!
Sorry, Alfred, I have to get to the Plaza.  You heard Penguin, he was practically begging me to show.
'Fraid I can't.  There's been a kidnapping ... Tell Selina ... Ms. Kyle ... that some business came up -- no, tell her some major deal fell through, she'll feel sorry ... No, no, here's what to do, just tell her ... let her know that I ... not in a dumb "Be my girlfriend way," but --
Ah.  "Who", may I ask, are you going "as"?
Well that's a ... long story ...
... and me.  No, that's be me and me.  Is that what I said?
I'm sure he's wonderful company and all, but ... doesn't the gold- plated bachelor bit get a little ... stale?
Well?  Was "Vicki" right?  About your difficulty with duality?
I, ah ... never fool around on the first date.
A kiss under the mistletoe. Mistletoe can be deadly, if you eat it ...
... What do we do?
Hmm.  Primitive ventilation.
What happened?
Let's make a deal.  <u>Other</u> than my blood, what can I off--
He napalmed my arm.  He knocked me off a building just when I was starting to feel good about myself. I want to play an integral part in his degradation.
Me, domesticated?  By you?  I doubt it!  You repulsive... awful... <u>penguin</u>.
I ... it was terrible, I leaned over, and accidentally knocked her, out --
Well, um... funny thing, your penguins... they're not responding to the launch command.  Fact they're kind of turned around now... Like someone jammed our signal...
Actually this is all just a bad dream.  You're home in bed. Heavily sedated, resting comfortably, and dying from the carcinogens you've personally spewed in a lifetime of profiteering. Tragic irony or poetic justice? You tell me.
What, is that supposed to "hypnotize" me?
Yawn.  That coulda come from anywhere.
Wonder if it's worth my time.
A platform?  Lemme see ... Stop global warming.  Start global cooling.  Make the world a colder place.  <u>Frigid</u> ...
Precisely.  But they must come and go via the plumbing ducts that I've provided.  That shall be as sacred as the separation between church and state.
Why, how industrious.  And how did you open protected files, may I ask?
Big giant <u>capacitor</u>.  And that, instead of generating power it'll sort of be --  -- <u>sucking</u> power, from Gotham City, and storing it ... stockpiling it, sort of?  Which, unless I'm being dense, is a novel approach, I'd say.
... Where did curiosity get the cat?
And a very, very good one.
It's our secret.  Honest.  How can you be so mean to someone so meaningless?
How long has it been, Uncle Alfred?
I'm sorry, Uncle, I came to tuck you in.  And...
You have?
Well, I hope you'll stay with us.
Oh, but, sir.  So much goes on-
Alfred, old friend, I could use your help right now.
It's good to see you.
Pamela Isley.  I was so attracted to her I couldn't reason clearly.  I still can't.  She used to work for Wayne Enterprises.  Find a file.
Sometimes counting on someone else is the only way to win.
I could have made it, you know.  I didn't need your help.
Crimefighter's rule number two.
Pow!  What!  Kazow!
It'll take the satellites about a minute to re-align, but...damn!
After you have frozen, your icy tomb will plummet back to Gotham.
... A giant drilling truck burrowing under the city ...
Watch the first step.
Remember the victim at the airport. Toxins introduced through the mouth.
We gotta get those locks changed.
Tell me, billionaire, would you warm faster to my pleas if I looked more like Ms. January here?
And?
You're not even listening to me.
Julie, I'm not the marrying kind. There are things about me you wouldn't understand.
I wouldn't bet on that.
Make a choice, Bruce.  Her or me.
You know Alfred.  He'd never say Anything.  But I can tell.  Until you came along, Alfred was the only family I ever had.  Without him, I don't know how I would have survived.  He saved my life, Dick.  And I've never told him.
Is that it, Bruce?  I'm under some magic spell?
Let me guess, Plant Girl? Vine Lady? Ms. Moss?
An enticing offer.  But what does the lady want in return?
In my weakened state I am no match for the bat and the bird.
I have created a race of plants with the strength of the deadliest animals.  Once you have frozen mankind, my mutants will overrun the globe.  The Earth will become a brave new world of only plants. And we shall rule them.  For we will be the only two people left in the world.
Give it up.  If you threw yourself-
Kiss me and I'll tell you.
You should have heeded your pointy- eared pal.  These lips can be murder.
What do we have here?  A lovely new supply of Venom.  I'll just take this to my laboratory for further study.
...Our original sponsor had no stomach for military applications. he cut the funding for our work -
Join you?  I've spent my life trying to protect plants from extinction and now you corrupt my research into some maniacal scheme for world domination. When I get through you won't be able to get a job teaching high school chemistry, do you hear me, you psycho?
Dr. Isley?  Pamela?  You look great. Especially for a dead woman.
Sorry to bother you, sir. I have some rather distressing news about Master Dick.
I'm afraid Master Dick has... gone traveling.
Why do I keep doing this?
Old habits die hard. Are you alright?
Master, Bruce?
All the answers are numbers.
Letters in the alphabet.
What now sir?
May I help you, Master Grayson?
Bats aren't rodents, Dr. Meridian.
Now black rubber.
I'm not the kind of guy who blends in at a family picnic.
Mr. Nygma, you'll forgive me for being rude. But what exactly is on your mind?
We'll talk some other -
My opinion. This letter writer is a total wacko.
But...
Fast work. You just moved here.
Come on, Bruce. This is what I do for a living.
In a sense we are all two people. The side we show in daylight. And that side we keep in shadow.
...Not the bat?
Back off, man.
What the hell did you think you were doing?
How about Richard Grayson, college student?
We don't kill. Killing is what damns you. It-. What am I talking about? This conversation is over. You're going away to school.
Edward...
I'll show you it works.
_We_ sure are.
How'd you find us?
Why do we need you? You only come between us. We can be the smartest person in Gotham City. We want the empire for ourselves. Time's up, laughing boy.
How high up would you say that is?
Excuse me, sir.  Commissioner Gordon was compelled to leave - -very unexpectedly.  He asked me to convey his regrets.
It's all right, Alfred. Everything's under control.
You know, we should've sat down and had us a little heart-to-heart. I bet we would have got on famously.
What about the girl?
Can't we --
...Not even a 'thank you'?
I'll have to ask you for that film.
How'd you find this place?
Do you sail?
There's terror everywhere.  If you train yourself to look for it.
But it's not fair.  I'm half drunk and you're not even --
I don't sing very well.
To tell you the truth, I'd just about given up waiting.
All street mimes should be executed.
I realize... the way things have gone between us...  ... I wish you'd reconsider.
Vicki?... This is Batman. I thought I'd call and see how you're doing.
So we just pretend none of this ever happened. We never met. We --  -- You're going to get yourself killed, Bruce. You know that, don't you?
Money makes money, Vicki. The foundation runs itself -- I'm extraneous to the process.
Keep her on the line!
I'm sorry, she hung up. What are --
How can you do that if she's already off the line?
I don't, but... I do. It's just... I love you, Bruce. I don't want you to...
All right, Bruce, what do you suggest?
SOMEBODY'S KILLED THE POWER!!
MOVE! Can't you do something??
Why do you need me to handle a simple break-in?
It's me.  "Sugar Bumps."
It's not the girl, Jack.  Sooner or later you would've tried to take me.  You may get me now, but your life won't be worth a dime.
Jack - - please - - WIPE THAT LUNATIC GRIN OFF YOUR FACE.
You SCUM!  You SICK FILTH!... You DID THAT to her!
I'll see you burn.  I'll see you dead -- GET AWAY FROM ME!!
Rich.  Reclusive.  Bankrolls half a dozen charities.
Guess who's got a date with Bruce Wayne?
Allie, I know exactly why you're doing this.
Alexander... I know you.
Couldn't turn down the job, huh? A girl could get hurt this way.
HOLY SHIT!!
Yeeees?
There aren't hotels?
Do we know anything about him?
Ali?  What's wrong?
Shut up, Kevin.  Honey, you-re not making sense ...
Everything's gonna be fine.
He's not too bad.  I can live with him.
Goodnight Annie.
Big day today, huh? 78
David.  There's a call for you.  It's your wife.
Oh yes.
I was hoping DU.  Bean might take a look at my computer project today.
Everything okay, David?
We'll be able to start this afternoon.  I'11 pipe the guide to every video screen in the gallery.  Now, that'll impress the Governor.
Ah... He certainly has something, sir.
Brilliant, huh?  I already have a prospective buyer - the current Governor of California, no less, who is flies in tomorrow to inspect her and clinch the deal.  Spread the news.  I think decisive leadership has done the trick, don't you?
Bravo.  Let's put on a good show tomorrow, shall we?  Don't want anything to go wrong.
Welsh again.
Bye, Dad.
Hiya Dad ~ I'll need you upstairs for homework in about ....  oh, 20 minutes.
Hey, En, nice bike'- but remember: any kids you have are gonna look just like its handsome driver.
Doctor Jacobson?
Shut up, Kevin.
This sucks.
Huh huh huh. That was cool.
Huh huh huh. He said "anus."
Nnnnooo. Oooooh nooooo.
Wait, I wanted her to do it.
Uh, huh huh, this is Las Vegas?
That's Butt-Head. Don't you get it, Beavis. These dudes have the same name as us.
Ow! Cut it out Butt-Head.
Ow! I'll kick your butt!
Huh huh huh. Hey Beavis. We're on a bus with chicks.
Check it out Butt-Head, porta-potties.
Whoa, my life is cool!
Hey Butt-Head, look. A jack. Heh heh.
Hey Butt-Head it's that chick!
Well where is she?!
Heh heh. Fire. Heh heh Aaaaeeehhhhg!!!
I always thought there was something wrong with him. Heh heh heh.
Shut up, dill-hole.
Um... ass... head...
Oh, there are so many slots you won't know where to begin.
They perk me right up.
Uh, we didn't score yet.
This is Agent Flemming, A.T.F.. We won't hurt you. We just want the unit. Tell us where the unit is.
You must bow down to the Almighty Bunghole.  Heh heh, this is cool.  Bungholio-o-o-o-o-o!
Damn right. Bork, we're dealing with real pros here. My opinion, terrorists... What's the scoop on that stolen unit?
Not on him, Chief.
Chief, look!
Well, Earl said you guys were young, but jeez... Oh well, as long as you can get the job done. So what are your names?
Here she is. Her name's Dallas. She ain't as sweet as she looks. She stole everything from me. Ya gotta watch out, 'cause she'll do you twice as fast as you'd do her.
One more thing. Mah wife's got this leather satchel. It's black, about this big. I need ya to bring it back. It's real important. Sentimental value... Any questions so far?
Adam my booyy!  When you're really rich in what matters...  ... nothing matters!  My buyer has just made a killing in condos in the Village.  And he's got a little stress problem...  ... so his wife says they want the old peace and quiet!
Get <u>away</u> you little monster.
Manchurian Tung oil?  Where did you get it?
Yeah, I want to get one coat on the wardrobe and then I'll help you.
Jane said we should sell the house to someone with a family.
What?
Handbook for the recently diseased.
I don't like situations like this. I hate it when I'm not in control. So just tell me the basics.
There are a thousand things... Why did you disappear when you walked off the front porch?  Is this a punishment?  Are we halfway to heaven or are we halfway to hell? And how long is this going to <u>last</u>?
Just says 'won't.'  Wait a minute. Here it says 'the living are arrogant... they think they'll never die, so they refuse to see the dead.'
I guess... if I'm going to be dead, I'll just have to be the best dead person ever!
Is this a punishment for something we did in life?  What can we do?
Oh, Adam, don't ever leave me alone.
My God, we're back where we started.
That guy is in our cemetery.  Oh, Adam.
Lydia's trying, but they don't believe her.
What happened?
I guess we open it.
But <u>we</u> let him out.
And your sushi was remarkable.
<u>Adam</u>!  Why did you build a whorehouse?  Have you ever been to...?
Oh, Adam, don't tease her.  You never got an A in science in your life!
A... Are you the guys who're hiding out in the attic?
What?
You can actually see us?  Without the sheets?
<u>You</u> did this?  You carved all these little figures and houses and things?
You tell them that we are desperate horrible ghoulish creatures who will stop at nothing to get back our house.
We studied all day yesterday. Don't tell me...
Help vouchers?
<u>So</u> you, the dead, want me, <u>the</u> <u>undead</u>, to throw the live guys -- Mommie, Daddy and Lolita, who might not mind a tumble with an older guy, out into the cold? Even though they have paid hard casharoonie for your dump?
Okay.  But that Betelgeuse sure seemed mad.
This is <u>my</u> town.
I heard.  Tore your face right off!  Bad news.  It obviously doesn't do any good to pull your heads off in front of people if they can't see you.
<u>Don't say his name</u>!  Just practice. Do it <u>yourself</u>!
Just get some people out of our house.
No, you don't!  He does not work well with others.
He's a freelance bio-exorcist. Claims to get rid of the living. But he's a troublemaker.  He's pushy.  He's been sleazing around that cemetery for 500 years.
What about Betelgeuse?
If I had seen a ghost at your age, I would have been frightened out of my wits.
I don't wear that stuff to <u>bed</u>. Besides, there's <u>nothing</u> wrong with it.  I'm getting out of here.
Hi, Barb!  I'm glad I caught you. I heard you were on vacation!
Cookie, they are dead, dead, deadski.
You do?  Over here?  On <u>my</u> side?
I can't help you from this side, but here's how we do it.  So <u>simple</u>.  Say my name three times. That's all.  I'll be all yours. Then I'll bring you over here in style.
Breakfast beetle?  Beetle?  Beetle fruit?  Fruit bat?  Fruit battle? Volkswagen?  Fruit wagon?
You were the snake!  Right?  I know.  I saw you.
They'd look silly on me.  I'm fourteen years old!
So... You're ready for me now?
Otho?
I was just trying to open the door.  Mrs. Butterfield brought over a skeleton key.
Look at all that <u>parking</u>!
Now, let's get back to business. I want to get Maxie Dean and Sarah up here immediately.  I can make history here!  I'm going to turn this sleepy little backward town into a leading supernatural research center... and amusement park.
I'll bring the wine... and the business plan.  And Lydia you'll bring the ghosts.
They're... not here anymore.
I don't care from guilt.  I just want to <u>see</u> them.
<u>You jerks</u>!  That is my art, and it is <u>dangerous</u>!  You think I want to die like that?  Lydia.  Moving is a family affair. So buckle down now and go get Mommy some drugs.
Don't you <u>dare</u>.
Lydia, I will never forgive you for embarrassing me in front of my social inferiors.  You help us with these ghosts or you'll be sorry.
Okay?
<u>I know</u>... I read your book, <u>The</u> <u>Haunted Tapestries of the Waldorf</u>.
Oh, Delia, lighten up!
Look at that <u>detail</u>!
Perhaps if I were properly motivated.
... And please call me Robert.
... Oh.  ... My God, I only wish that Benjamin had your recuperative powers... Anyway, the President offered to sit in for Ben at the meeting, quite a nice gesture, I felt. He's due here soon, I believe.
Yes. I love Eve very much.
Some pain is to be expected...  ... And I think what would be best for the two of you is a good night's rest.  ... It's late, I'm afraid it's time for my patients to prepare for bed.
And you, Benjamin, must be strong and brave for me. Turn over, please.
... Eve - this has been an exhausting day for Ben...
... He walked off...
Oh. I have a message for him.
Oh, Mr. Gardiner, I've been looking all over.
Of course. They would like you to appear on the show tonight. The Vice President was scheduled, but he had to cancel, and they asked if you would be interested.
Fine. They felt that since you had such close ties with the President, you would be a splendid choice.  ... Can I help you? Are you looking for something?
... Won't you let us do something for you? Your leg should be examined, we could take you to a hospital.
Yes. My husband has been very ill. His doctor and nurses are staying with us. Those hospitals can be so impersonal - why, it might be hours before you are treated...
Would you care for a drink?
I would like to watch television.
Oh... Mr. Gardiner... Mr. Chauncey Gardiner... You're not related to Basil and Perdita Gardiner are you?
Chauncey, I wanted to tell you how dreadful I feel about the accident today, but that I'm delighted that you are staying with us.
Chauncey...
... You don't happen to have a tuxedo in your suitcase, do you?
Well, it seems you've been described as one of the architects of the President's speech. And your own comments from the 'This Evening' show are quoted side by side with the President's.
... I'm grateful to you, Chauncey... I would have opened to you with a touch, and you know that...  ... But you're so strong - I can trust myself with you. I'm glad, Chauncey - I'm glad that you showed so much restraint...
Upstairs? Chauncey, you're always involved in some sort of discussion...
Oh, Chauncey, darling... Where have you been? We thought we'd lost you - we've been looking all over!
Of course. But since he is ill I'm taking the liberty of asking you.
I see. Then one more quick question, Mr. Gardiner; since we at the Post would like to, uh - update our profile on you - what exactly is your business?
Do you need a doctor? I could call Robert...
To exchange our thoughts - what does a Russian know about business? On the other hand, what does an American know about diplomacy?
Bravo! Bravo! Our chairs are indeed almost touching! And we want to remain seated on them, correct? We don't want them snatched from under us, am I right? Because if one goes, the other goes, and then - boom! Boom! And we are both down before our time, you see? And neither of us wants that, do you agree?
Welcome to Rand Memorial Hospital, Mr. Gardiner.
Failure of the bone marrow to produce red blood cells... Not a damn thing they can do about it. Oh, they can make me comfortable, prolong my life with steroid therapy and transfusions... And what makes my blood boil, what little I have left, that is, Mr. Gardiner - is that it's generally a young person's disease... Here I am, getting on in years and about to die of a young person's disease...
... You will join us for dinner, won't you, Mr. Gardiner?
That's good, Mr. Gardiner. Or may I call you Chauncey?
No one likes a dying man, my boy - because few know what death is. All we know is the terror of it. But you're an exception, Chauncey - that's what I admire in you, your marvelous balance. You don't stagger back and forth between fear and hope - you're a truly peaceful man.
Oh, sure you do, the financial assistance program. I think you might be just the man to take charge of such an undertaking. I'd like you to meet with the members of the Board, we'll be able to discuss the matter at greater length at that time.
Tell Eve? You mean Mrs. Rand?
Mr. Gardiner, my editors and I have been wondering if you'd consider writing a book for us? Something on your political philosophy. What do you say?
Of course, who can nowadays? I have trouble writing a post card to my children! Look, we could give you a six figure advance, provide you with the very best ghostwriter, research assistants, proof readers...
... Did you wish to see someone, sir?
... Then you really are a gardener?
... That is a very small room.
... Back up those stairs - damn... That Man's needin' me more and more just before he never needs me again...
... I see.
I'd like to thank you for filling in on such short notice for the Vice President.
I always find it surprising, Mr. Gardiner, to find men like yourself, who are working so intimately with the President, yet manage to remain relatively unknown.
... Well, your anonymity will be a thing of the past from now on.
Yes... Of course, you know, Mr. Gardiner, that I always prefer an open and frank conversation with my guests, I hope you don't object to that.
Well, Mr. Gardiner, from the sound of our audience, I'd say that your words are a most welcome respite from what we've been hearing from others...
I'm sorry to say that our time is running short, but before we close, I'd like to ask one final question. What sort of gardener, sir, would you be?
Do you have any proof of your employment, Mr. Chance - any checks from the deceased, any contracts or documents?
... Joe? Who's Joe?
1952...?
Correct.
You look much taller on television, Mr. President.
... In the garden?
No headaches?
Do you feel well enough for that?
... This is another world, Tom - I never would have believed it...
... Would you take me on a tour?
... What do you make of all this?
It's that gardener!
Kaufman, I'm going to need information on Mr. Chauncey Gardiner's background.
He's an advisor and close personal friend of Rand's! For Christ sakes, they have volumes of data on Benjamin!
That is correct, Comrade Skrapinov. We have ascertained that Gardiner heads a big-business power group that will soon be taking over the American government.
Mr. President, I'd like you to meet my dear friend, Mr. Chauncey Gardiner.
Well, Ben... I...
... There is no longer any margin for inflation, it has gone as far as it can, you've reached your limits on taxation, dependence on foreign energy has reached a crisis, and, from where I see it, Mr. President, the Free Enterprise System has reached the breaking point. We are on the brink of another crash from which recovery might not be possible.
No, she flew up to Boston for another charity event. She'll be sorry to have missed you.
Say, aren't you that actor guy?
I don't know.
We've been over this. Nobody's looking for a puppeteer in today's wintry economic climate.
Which one is Elijah again?
Isn't that cute? I just taught her that.
Tom-Tom's puncture wound is infected.
I have to go back.
I have to go back, Craig. Being inside did something to me. All of a sudden everything made sense. I knew who I was.
What, are you nuts? That's Oprah talking.
Why?
What are you doing?
I'm getting rid of the fucking animals.
I'm getting rid of the animals. I've lost interest. Besides, they're standing between you and me.
I'm giving them up. I've changed. I've found a new focus.
And he was with her.
I'm your Goddamn wife. Once you vowed to cherish me forever. Now you hold a gun to my head?
Tell her, what the hell, close early today, live dangerously.
Ah, but you're forgetting one thing, Lambchop.
Once this was a relationship based on love. Now you have me in a cage with a monkey and a gun to my head.
You're not a monster, Craig. Just a confused man.
I'm in love. For the first time. It's funny, but when it happens to you, there's no question.
The monkey.
Holy shit, yes!
Mr. Malkovich, my name is Craig Schwartz. I can explain. We operate a little business her that... simulates, for our clientele, the experience of... being you, actually.
Pardon?
I'm sorry, I'm afraid I have no idea what you're saying right now.
You're not like the other boys we've had here. Granted, I can't understand what you're saying either, but your soft palette resonates tremendously well and you never ever constrict your epiglottis.
Floris, you're very nice, but I'm afraid I’m in love with somebody else.
You don't have a speech impediment, Dr. Lester.
No.
Just one. Why is this floor so short?
Imagine a room full of women. Nubile, blonde, wet with desire, Schwartz. A harem, if you will. Me in leather. A harness, if you like. I am the object of this desire, and all eyes are on me as I speak. “Ladies,” I begin. “I am the love god, Eros. I intoxicate you. My spunk is to you manna from heaven...
You're making a big mistake, Schwartz.  Ma'am
And fifty other lines to get into a girl's pants.
What?
I’m not a homosexual. I just like women for more than their bodies. I guess you could say I'm the new American male.
Let him try.
So that's the story of 7 1/2. Since the rents are considerably lower this floor has been adopted by businesses which for one reason or another are forced to cut corners After all... the overhead is low! Ha ha ha!
If there was any way I could go in your place. But I'm only a monkey and...
No. Don't be an ass.
Two hundred dollars, please.
Boy, this is a toughie. To be honest, I didn't anticipate this.
Right, Lester. I heard you the first time. I'm not a dummy.
Vegas? What'd you think?
No, a sexy dream. Of course, a scary dream.
I missed you. I'm sorry. Tell me the plan.
Floris, get Guinness on the phone.
Forget it.
Says me. Do you dream often?
Kevin, I'm telling you... it was like nothing I've...
I don't know anything about her. What if she's some sort of witch or something?
Tell me, Lotte, can you understand a word I'm saying?
Don't stand in the way of my actualization as a man, Craig.
Ah.
When?
Oh my darling. Oh my sweetheart.
She's not available.
How'd you get this number?
Thanks so much for coming over.
So, do you enjoy being an actor?
I'm sorry, did you just call me "Lotte"?
Yes, yes, sweetheart, yes!  What the fuck is going on? I'm not talking. This is not me!
Darling!
That was incredible. You're brilliant!
No one would ever have to know its not him.
Doesn't he know how important tonight is to us?
Honey, we can be happy and poor together.
I got a delivery around here. Name of Tucker.
We have to be steady. "These things too will pass". What you looking for? A miracle?
WATCH OUT FOR HER; SHE CAN GIVE YOU DREAMS.
YOU CAME BACK BECAUSE OF ME?
YOU NEVER FORGOT ME?
You don't sit with me!! I don't sit with people who leave me!
They treating you right over at the Bodwins?
You think I should stop by? Think she'd welcome it?
Well, if you want my opinion...
I can't do anything but I would learn it for you if you have a little extra.
Back stiff?
Could be that fall you took.
But mama..
Mama let me help you.
Somebody new there. A woman. Thought you might know who she is.
I know Denver.
I know what I see.
The church!
Why? Why he have to ask? Can't nobody offer? What's going on? Since when a black man come to town have to sleep in the cellar like a dog?!
NO! Shouldn't be no days! You know all about it and don't give him a hand? That don't sound like you, Ella. Me and you been pulling colored folk out the water more'n twenty years! Now you tell me you can't offer a man a bed?! A working man who can pay his own way?
It's her, ain't it?
What run him off? Tell me that!
You didn't tell me that. I thought he already knew.
I did. Down to the cent.$900. Always wondered though what Mrs. Garner got for my brother Paul F. Must of been more than nine hundred dollars cause she use that money for Sweet Home for almost two years. But then they hung my other brother Paul A. up on a tree so I guess he wasn't worth the same..I wonder what was Baby Suggs worth? And Halle? I wasn't surprised when I found out they tracked down Sethe all the way to Cincinatti. Her price must have been higher than all of us - her being property that reproduced itself without cost. A breeder.
They'll know. They'll know as soon as they born. Cause it's inside us,Stamp. It'll be inside them. We'll pass it down. Schoolteacher didn't just change the outside, he changed the mind..and the blood..and what it carries...and what it's worth..
She scares me. I scare me. And that girl in her house scares me.
Sethe?
She comes in the daytime.  She still with me, my Denver.
What the hell you thinking, girl? Strolling in here this late?
Yeah.  Jackie Treehorn wants to talk to the deadbeat Lebowski.
Well, enjoy, and perhaps we'll see you again some time, Dude.
They called about eighty minutes ago.  They want you to take the money and drive north on the 4 5.  They'll call you on the portable phone with instructions in about forty minutes. One person only or I'd go with you. They were very clear on that: one person only.  What happened to your jaw?
Mr. Lebowski asked me to repeat that: Her life is in your hands.
VEE FUCK YOU UP, MAN!
Sheesh.
Where you going, Dude?
Yeah Walter, what's your point?
It's already posted.
And then they're gonna stamp on it?!
Am I wrong?
What have you.  We'll, uh--
--had a rough night, and I hate the fucking Eagles, man--
Please, feel free to inspect them.
That's the key to the city of Pasadena, which Mr. Lebowski was given two years ago in recognition of his various civic, uh.
That is indeed Mr. Lebowski with the first lady, yes, taken when--
Yes, heh--
Sometimes.  I wouldn't hold out much hope for the tape deck though.  Or the Creedence tapes.
Thanks, Gary...Take care, man, I gotta get back.
Of course, there's that to discuss. Refill?
No!  No!  NO!  THAT'S NOT--
Francis Donnelly.  Pleased to meet you.
Excuse me?
Yeah, but my-
Well--sure, I could do that--
That's really thoughtful but I--
Do you have any news regarding my father's money?
From who?
Her "co-star" in the beaver picture?
Not the compromised second draft. And then I, uh. . . Ever hear of the Seattle Seven?
I keep telling you, it's the Foundation's money.  Father doesn't have any.
This was, uh--
Forget it, Donny.  You're out of your element.
What the fuck are you talking about?! This Chinaman is not the issue!  I'm talking about drawing a line in the sand, Dude.  Across this line you do not, uh--and also, Dude, Chinaman is not the preferred, uh. . . Asian- American.  Please.
So who--
Yeah, but--
State of Israel.  If you will it, Dude, it is no--
I'm saying, Cynthia's Pomeranian. I'm looking after it while Cynthia and Marty Ackerman are in Hawaii.
Walter, they're calling the cops, put the piece away.
Walter, you can't do that.  These guys're like me, they're pacificists. Smokey was a conscientious objector.
And you know Smokey has emotional problems!
That...fucking...bitch!
Those rich fucks!  This whole fucking thing-- I did not watch my buddies die face down in the muck so that this fucking strumpet--
What the hell is this?
Walter, I'm sure there's a reason you brought your dirty undies--
We?  What the fuck we?  You said you just wanted to come along--
Oh shit.  Walter.
Wooden bridge, huh?
Walter!
It's been stolen, Walter!  You fucking know it's been stolen!
That wasn't her toe.
How the fuck should I know?  I do know that nothing about it indicates--
Fine, Dude.  As if it's impossible to get some nail polish, apply it to someone else's toe--
I'll  get  you  a  toe by  this afternoon--with nail  polish. These fucking amateurs.   They send us a toe, we're  supposed to  shit our- selves with fear.  Jesus Christ. My point is--
Well that's just, that's the stress talking, Dude.  So far we have what looks to me like a series of victimless crimes--
Who gives a shit about the fucking marmot!
Who the fuck is Arthur Digby Sellers?
Yeah.
Is this yours, Larry?  Is this your homework, Larry?
Look, Larry. . . Have you ever heard of Vietnam?
You're going to enter a world of pain, son.  We know that this is your homework.  We know you stole a car--
I'm saying if he knows I'm a fuck- up, then why does he still leave me in charge of getting back his wife? Because he fucking doesn't want her back, man!  He's had enough!  He no longer digs her!  It's all a show! But then, why didn't he give a shit about his million bucks?  I mean, he knew we didn't hand off his briefcase, but he never asked for it back.
You're fucking Polish Catholic--
And you were divorced five fucking years ago.
This driveway.
Hey, cool it Walter.  Listen, pal, there never was any money.  The big Lebowski gave me an empty briefcase, man, so take it up with him.
Hy God!  They shot him, Walter!
Well can we--
We're scattering the fucking ashes!
What about that shit about Vietnam!
Dude the Bagman.  Where do you want us to go?
Another Caucasian, Gary.
Well sir, it's this rug I have, really tied the room together-
No, look.  I do mind.  The Dude minds. This will not stand, ya know, this will not stand, man.  I mean, if your wife owes--
It's funny.  I can look back on a life of achievement, on challenges met, competitors bested, obstacles overcome.  I've accomplished more than most men, and without the use of my legs.  What. . . What makes a man, Mr. Lebowski?
Is it. . . is it, being prepared to do the right thing?  Whatever the price?  Isn't that what makes a man?
Fuckin' A.
Well sure, look at it!  Young trophy wife, I mean, in the parlance of our times, owes money all over town, including to known pornographers-- and that's cool, that's cool-- but I'm saying, she needs money, and of course they're gonna say they didn't get it 'cause she wants more, man, she's gotta feed the monkey, I mean-- hasn't that ever occurred to you...? Sir?
Put me down, you son of a bitch!
Oh, shit.
Bullshit. Walter!
Yeah, but--
Tom here's my ninth hard felon of the month. Six weeks he'll be sucking gas. In three years I'll be working Central Warrants. Jewboy Deputy D.A. over there wets his pants for fighters. Promised me the next spot he can wangle.
What?
This is our world you're entering.  You may see things -- feeding.  Just remember why you're here.
Blade.  We've got six Reapers.  They're all dead.
You're hurting me.
How does it look?
How do you feel?
What do you think?
Your security's for shit, kid.
What's your problem, Whistler?
Come on, Blade.  Talk to me!
Nomak?
Kiss your ass goodbye, Reinhardt.
Hey, hey!  The fuck you doing?!
From his father, of course.
I see from your questionnaire that you don't have any immediate next of kin?
Your blood has a very rare phenotype, one that's quite valuable to people like us.
This whole deal's giving me a serious case of the butt-willies.
Don't try to talk --
Who dies first?
You're too human, Blade.
Is something wrong, my friend?
This is an old tongue, from an old world. It concerns LaMagra.
The Day Walker's blood is a disparador -- a trigger, you see? For LaMagra's return. One need only consume it and the spirit of his ancestors will settle upon him.  "And the Sleeper will rise from the shadows anew, cleansing the world in a Tide of Blood."
I can't just leave. I have a life here, a career --
How did you know?
You used me as bait?!
That's a glyph, kind of like a vampire cattle brand. That means Officer Friendly here is someone's property. Any of the other vampire's try to bleed him, they'll have to answer to Friendly's owner --  This glyph belongs to Deacon Frost. We've been tracking him for a while now --
You can't do this, he's human, it's murder.
You let him go --  An hour ago you were ready to kill a man for less, this one didn't even talk.
So many of them -- I still can't believe they're real.
You're hurt --
What am I injecting you with?
I can't close my eyes without hearing her scream.
Get out of here --
How could you be a part of this?
I wish you could see the world as I do. Deacon opened my eyes. There's no turning back from that.
The red blood cells are biconvex, which is theoretically impossible. They're hypochromic, there's virtually no hemoglobin in them.  Look at the PMNs, they're binucleated, they should be mononucleated.
You haven't started in on the internal organs?
Tell me something, honestly, you ever have second thoughts about us?
-- but then I remember what an ass-hole you were and I'm snapped back to reality.
These archives are restricted to members of the House of Erebus.
What happens then?
LaMagra --
There's no need for any of this. Your condition can be treated. Whistler and I were working on a cure when --
Consider it a parting gift. Vampire mace -- silver nitrate, essence of garlic.
We keep in radio contact.
Blade's unique, you know. A one in a billion anomaly. He can withstand sunlight, garlic, even silver. But he still has the Thirst.
Why do you hunt them?
What do you mean?
No.
Please! Please...? I haven't done anything.
Domini?
Something was wrong.
The bitched-out babe in back here is one Anna Tassio--we met one dark and stormy night in a Blair Witch chat room, we all did--
--but she was nicer then--sweeter-- she hadn't vomited twice already like today--
--how old?
Where they found the backpacks and all the film a year later.
Druid Hill Park.
Whatzername--the "psychic" Anna hired.
So says her website.
--brother of Rustin Parr's maternal grandfather, somewhere after 1858--
The rest of the family was crazy as Rusty Parr.
Pardon me, I've had a few things on my mind--like putting this safari together.
And what do you possibly think you're going to fucking see there?
I'm not going anywhere, 'til--
Nothing. I dunno--
What'd you dream?
Then I'm going--
--hours before--
I know you're in there, you piece of shit!
You want a hand?
How'd you know they were--
My ass--you saw those four fucking baboons put 'em there!
Something happened to Anna in Burkittsville, in the woods, I don't know.
This is a little nuts.
The witch?
From-the-movie-Mary-Brown, Trailer Park Bible Psycho?
Nice tent.
What movies?
Three people: two guys, a girl-- sleeping in the same motel room, the same tent night after night.
Used to be a meat-packing plant. Slaughter on the ground floor-- carcasses schlepped up on this thing for dissection and grinding and--
Not the place you want to announce your arrival.
--f'chrissake, Heather, it's not like the two of us are gonna doze off he leaves for two seconds--
You drive, I'll handle the video, okay?
Okay, but--
<u>What</u>?
Running a junk yard.
There's four other angles, man, we haven't even--
--whatever you want, no problem--
Look at those marks--just like in the movie.
Oooh. Oooh.
Ripped? They look like they were <u>bit</u> off.
Pointless.
That'd be up on your shoulder, maybe your lower back.
For a blur?
What is it you thought you saw on that tape?
What?
No big deal. I'm just trying to understand.
The good old days: toasting marsh- mallows over a burning witch.
Spare me.
"It's why the witch kills children."
Good morning, Sheriff's Office.
There was an accident early this morning. Another car. Your father's injuries were fatal.
I'll tell your mother not to expect you at the funeral.
Well... the couch would be all right...
Uh-huh.
...You all right?
Well... what happened?
...But first I gotta know what happened.
...So what're you doing tonight?
Christ, I'm getting bored.
Sure don't.
What night is it?
Right. Friday night is Yankee night. Where're you from?
I told you. I like you.
...You know that car?
...What was that back there?
...Anything else?
...Well, if the pay's right and it's legal I'll do it.
Deuce in the corner needs help.
...I thought you were dead. Going home?
...I don't want that asshole near my money. I don't even want him in the bar.
Is Marty here?
Where was I?
Oh yeah?. Have you seen any?
Well, I haven't seen any. I wouldn't worry about it. Look. I better go.
I don't want to talk about it. Everything's okay now. I don't want to talk about it.
Frank. Come in.
Fuckin' good, real fuckin' good. You know this little tid bit, Dorothy, and this thing, here,  is a neighbor. What the shit we're doin' with a neighbor, I don't know. goddam!!! This is the suavest guy I know. look at you. You're one beautiful fucker, Ben. I love this jacket and that cigarette holder of yours. shit, that is too fuckin' much. Where's those glasses. this beer's gonna get too warm. I can't stand fuckin' warm beer. it makes me puke.
To your health, Frank.
See you Tuesday, Frank.
Are you Detective Williams?
My name is Jeffrey Beaumont - I live near you. I believe you know my father, Tom Beaumont - Beaumont's Hardware Store?
I was the same way when I was you age. I guess that's what got me into this business.
What is this? What color is it?
Okay. come on in. Looks like you had a bad face lift.
Is Sandy part of this?
Who knows you have these?
For now. Alright. you better be. And Sandy better not be involved with this, I can tell you. Be prepared to come in for further interrogation on this later.
Because of your information I alerted internal affairs to check out Detective Gordon.  I had to keep on with him as if nothing was different.  He slipped off on his own when he found out we were going to raid Frank's place.
Hello, daddy.
Who's this fuck?
Yes, but.
Bull.
He's the reformed dealer though who wanted to turn himself in. he's the one that caused Frank to come and Frank's fucking us real good. I just feel so horny. I'm supposed to be here watching you why can't I be here fucking you. Listen. I know his cock's the size of a pin - let me give you the real thing. let me wet my whistle, baby.
You tell me!! Let me see that wallet.  Jeffrey Beaumont. What're you doing in my apartment, Jeffrey Beaumont?
Don?
Yes.
Yes.
Do you like me?
I made it go down the toilet.
. I. uh.
Look.
No. But you're in very big trouble.
Yes.
No. I should go.
Do you like my body?
What do you want to do?
Are you a bad boy?
You like to open me. don't you?
Shut up.
Wait a minute. Wait. Whatiya want? For cryin' out loud!
There's no disease, I can tell you.
You called me Jeffrey.
What?
Oh no.
Yeah, it's me.
HELP HIM!! Promise me you'll help him!
You seemed to see some very interesting things on your little escapade with Dorothy Vallens.
Yeah, how did you know?
Yeah I did. treasurer. Shouldn't you be studying or something.
That's the building. She lives on the Seventh Floor. Don't stop to look long . the police are watching.
What happened to him?
I guess Mike's got some sort of sports practice in the afternoon.
Alright, now tell me. What is it?
I already know. The "Slow Club." It's on Route 7.
Here's to. an interesting experience.
Jeffrey, I don't think you ought to do it.
Yeah. but.
Okay. yeah, call.
What's with Mike?
Who, me? Why should it?
You're sure right. It is a strange world.
So are you.  I mean you're a neat guy. We better get back.
What am I going to do?
Shoot.
Maybe. But I think the Yellow Man is on drugs. I think Frank supplies him.
Everything okay?
Just go over to Gelford and up to Vista. It's not far. Can you tell me any more about what you learned?
Thank you. Whatiya say we just enjoy the evening?
NO.
Dorothy! ... Dorothy!
Are you feeling okay?
Well. Okay.
I'm going out for awhile.
No. you're right.
I was sorry to hear about your father. I know your mother from church. It's such a shame.
Mike's gotta go.  Nice to meet you.
QUIET!  Callate!  Where's Diego?
Greetings, Mr. George.
Are you sure this guy is cool?
Nothing like this back home.
We're gonna call it California sinsemilla.  Sounds exotic.
Should we buy it?
Are you sure you're okay?  You're pale.
No, not at all.  Sure.  You're right. You fly home and get some rest.
Two years.  George, I can't wait that long.
You can't sell this to your friends.
Mr. Jung, you're a convicted felon, correct?
Excuse me?
Hmm.  I see.  Will there be clothes in the suitcase?
The way we figure it, Barbara flies to Boston twice a week.  Two bags per flight.  Twenty-five pounds in each bag.
Half a million for you.  Half a million for me.  One-point-three five for the Colombians.
Your offense?  Why are you here?
What kind of project?
Getting it here is no problem.  Trust me.  I'll fly it in myself if I have to. What about supply?  How much can we get?
Fifteen hundred.  We'll have to stop somewhere to refuel.
You need to come down here, everybody meets everybody.  Ho ho ho.  Ha ha ha. We do one for good faith and then we talk about airplanes.
I know.
Jesus Christ, George, I don't see you in two years, and you show up at my door with a hundred and ten pounds of cocaine?
Three years.  How long have we been in business?  Three years.  Does she get to meet your connection?  Was she good enough?
Estoy bien, okay?  Everything is alright.  There's no problem.  Okay? This never happened.  No one has to know anything about this.  Diego, I want you to calmly tell them where the fucking coke is.  Do it now.
I did not.
Cocaine?  How much?
In how long?  A week?
Well, you know.  It's um...
It's a family heirloom.
Tell him I don't want to see him.  Tell him he's not welcome here.
Yeah.  Nice.
I like you, George.  You are loyal. That is good.  That is rare.  Maybe crazy.  Yes.  I can tell already.  You are like me.  I look at you and I see myself.  It's in the eyes, no, George?
I want money.
Yeah, maybe.
Keep them coming.
I'm sorry, George.
There's something out there for me, Dad. Something different.  Something free form, you know?  Something for me, and college just isn't it.
What are you going to do?
Yeah, Dad.  I really did.  What am I gonna do?
You mad at me?
You're like your mother.  You love money.
She's angry.  It's all over the news.
I meant every word of it.
How are you doing, George?
George.
Hello.
Do I know you?
I don't know.  My name is George.
What?
Yeah.  She told me.  You walk her to school.
Yeah?  I better see some money out of it.
Everything's gonna be okay, sweetheart. Don't be upset.
I don't know.
What are you doing here?
George, you just can't show up, tell me you love me, and have everything be okay.
I don't know.  Maybe California.
That's right.  Three o'clock.  Thursday. At your mother's.  You and me.  It's a date.
I love you.  I love you so much.  You've got to know that.  You've got to know.
Do you see him here in the courtroom?
Well, I'll tell you.  I was walking down the beach, minding my business, when who did I see but this fucking guy.  I didn't know you guys were living in California.
Okay.  So we need a source.  Where do we start?
Holy shit, Dulli!
No shit, Kevin?
What's the matter, George?  Something wrong?  You look like you just fucked your mother.
Colonel Mathieu ... Much has been said lately not only of the successes obtained by the paratroopers, but also of the methods that they have employed ... Can you tell us something about this?
In Indochina, <U>they</U> won.
What's important for me is that you let me risk my life for nothing.
And how many are we?
Be careful now. Unless you know how it works, it's better if you sit on the plank and move forward like this ...
It's clear. They'll do everything possible to make it fail.
Are you ready, colonel?
I don't think that this is the time, or the place.
What can we prove?
What was Mr. Marsh's physical condition prior to his death?
Is this the bottle that was found on the nightstand?
Your Honor, the State enters this evidence as exhibit A.  Were any fingerprints found on the bottle?
Your Honor, Mr. Roston is an ex-lover of Miss Lawson's.
No questions.
Lookin' to make the papers, John?
Why would she want that?
Suspicions maybe -- but suspicions aren't enough for a conviction.
Objection!  May I remind Mr. Dulaney that the person on trial here is Miss Lawson -- not Dr. Paley.
Mr. Marsh's Cardiologist and his nurse have told us that you accompanied Mr. Marsh to their office on at least two occasions.
Did you ever see Mr. Marsh use Cocaine?
Did you talk about Miss Lawson?
She was here?
I know this is a very personal subject, but could you be a little more specific?
Why not?
When you say your sexual relations with Miss Lawson were intense what exactly do you mean?
It's hard to resist a woman as beautiful as she is.
Where did you meet Miss Lawson?
Did you ever see her again after that?
Why?
What did she say?
Isn't it true that later that night you tried to force yourself on Miss Lawson in the parking lot?
Well -- as I remember it, we had an argument.
You can suggest anything you want. It happened.
How do you instruct your patients to take it?
I heard him say it.
No.
Where did you meet him?
I worked for Mr. Marsh for six years. He was a good man -- until she came along.
You don't really believe what the district attorney is saying about Miss Lawson, do you?
If you don't know her that well what makes you think she's capable of murder?
What about Miss Lawson?
Do you remember the date when you saw Miss Lawson in the bathroom?
Could you repeat the last part of what Mr. Marsh said to you the day before his death?
Yes.
Isn't it true that you put the cocaine in the bottle?
I need to ask you a question.  What made you get in touch with Joanne Braslow?
Yes.
You must have some feeling.  Some immediate impression.  A young, attractive woman, involved with an older man who leaves her everything in his will.  And the things that went on in that house.  Such wild sex.  What kind of picture does that paint?
I want you to know right now that the trial's going to be nasty.  Your sex life is going to be dragged through the mud.  They're going to say that you enticed Marsh -- led him down a dark path.
Something like that.
I think we're getting a little off the subject here.
As it pertains to you -- not me.  Did you always know you had different... tastes?
Nothing.
Hello?
Hi, Frank.
Yes -- she did.
It's going to be hard to convince a jury that he's testifying against you in a murder trial because you blew him off.
You lied to me!
Why would she lie?
Alone?
I'm dropping the case.
No -- he's lying.
Hey, you know better than that.  What did I teach you to say when someone is accused of doing something?
You know how it is sometimes when you're out playing ball with your friends?  How you're really concentrating on what you're doing -- and you lose track of time and you come home late and Mom yells at you?
Objection.  The witness has already stated that Miss Lawson left without an explanation.
The witness will answer the question.
If you want me to.
Frank -- I know you're busy, but Michael asked me after dinner if you were angry with him.  He wanted to know why you weren't talking to him.
Albert's got the stomach flu.
Not even if they're a dork?
I didn't know that Andrew was dead until Mr. Sattler called me at home that night.
Did Marsh use it?
Boy. It sure has been a long time.
Well, that's a long time.
Well, why don't I just say black so you can say white!  Don't be surprised to find your brother hasn't changed an iota. He hardly ever talks and when he does it's in that tone! You should have heard him at lunch -- not two words until the bill came and then he says, "Worth every penny."
Maybe it's an Italian thing. Their mother was Italian.
Well, I can help.
Oh, just a old letter from a friend.
I thought everything WAS arranged.
I remember a Mrs. Delaney but Mama told me years ago she died.
"-- going over and over in my mind every detail, every moment of our time together and I ask myself, "What happened to me in Madison County?" I struggle to put it together in a way that allows me to continue knowing we're on separate roads. But then I look through the lens of my camera, and you're there. I start to write an article and I find myself writing it to you. It's clear to me now we have been moving towards each other, towards those four days, all our lives --
What's he saying now?
He's getting her drunk. That's what happened. Jesus, maybe he forced himself. That's why she couldn't tell us.
Nice? He's trying to sleep with somebody's wife.
Then why do you?
I found out who Lucy Delaney is.  Remember the Delaneys from Hillcrest Road?
What about me! I feel really weird. Like she cheated on me, not dad. Isn't that sick? I don't mean I wanted to sleep with her or anything but -- ya know -- being the only son. You're sort of made to feel like you're the prince of the kingdom, ya know? And in the back of your mind, you kind of think your mother doesn't need sex anymore because she has you.
Oh, this heat! Times like this I wish we took that offer from your brother and moved on up to Michigan.
Madge. Please. Something's happened. I've met someone. I've fallen in love in a way I've never thought could happen my entire life. It's our last day together. I feel like I'm going to die when he leaves. Please. Help me.
No, leave it. I'll do it later. Listen, maybe you and Floyd can come for dinner on Saturday. I'm sure Richard'll have so many stories to tell you both about the fair and all.
If I'm not taking you away from anything.
So, how long you've been living here?
Oh, that's nice.
Well, thank you for all your help, Mrs. Johnson.
Everything does. One of the laws of nature. People are always so afraid of change. But if you look at it like it's something you can count on happening, it's actually a comfort. Not many things you can count on for sure.
I doubt that.
No. I mean yes, he's clean but he's also other things. He's a very hard worker. Very honest. Very caring. Gentle. Good father.
Is the dizziness gone?
"Making pictures." I like that. You really love what you do, don't you?
You sound like an artist.
I didn't mean that the way it sounded.
You drink bug repellent?
When?
Francesca?
Do you mind if I... ask you why you got divorced?
Woman friends, too?
Why doesn't it scare you?
Do you ever regret it? The divorce, I mean.
But no one in particular.
My mistake. I apologize.
Francesca?
I'm sorry I didn't call sooner, but I just read your note. I stuffed it into my pocket. The light was fading and I had to get my shot.
It's Robert.
Oh. I guess you got the whole story.
How about if I set the table?
Would you like a beer for your bath?
Right now. Tell me someplace you've been -- someplace on the other side of the world. Anywhere but here.
Yes.
Yes. Tell me about the day you got off the train.
Yes.
What were you like when you were younger?
I... What do you want?
I was honest with you. I told you who I was.
I won't be made to feel like I've done something wrong.
BECAUSE I CAN'T HAVE YOU!
No matter how much distance we put between us and this house, I bring with it with me. And I'll feel it every minute we're together. And I'll blame loving you for how much it hurts. And then even these four days won't be anything more than something sordid and... a mistake.
We are the choices we've made, Robert.
Mrs. Johnson! Mrs. Johnson! Is it true Cary Grant has proposed to you?
It's a Chicago station. I found it the other day.
What time is it?
"I had forgotten this. I had somehow remembered it being more his fault, his decision. Then I remembered we made love in that field before we left for home. And I remembered it was my idea. I remembered tearing his shirt and biting his body, hoping he would kidnap me. I had forgotten that too. And I wondered, as I sat there... how many other things I'd forgotten."
I'm positive.
Your mother left explicit instructions that she wished to be cremated.
Is it true?
Are you nuts?
Boys and girls, Moms and Dads.  Children of all ages, I'd like you to meet... Jimmy Bones.
You sure got a way with women, bro.  What happened up there?
You ain't going down there.  Not alone. I'll go.
We can climb out.
Clean your mouth, or I will.  Those boys had no business messing down there.  Go places you're not meant to be -- that's what you get.
Those 'fools' are my people.
Maybe I oughtta get there a little early. For good luck.
But.
'Sup Jimmy B. Shotgun.  Get back on the curb!  Now!
You know I can't.
Please.  It's for your own good.
He'll kill them.  He'll kill every last one of them.
Like what?  I got a little power, sure. A touch of the shining, a little of the sight.  But no more than you do.  We're not witches.  I can't wiggle my nose or say a magic word and make him go away. Besides, maybe they deserve it.  Maybe we all do.
Told you so.  Alright.  We tried.  Let's go home.
How do you know?
Careful.  That's bad luck.
Why?
Way I figure, everything our parents tell us is part true and part total B.S.  And our whole job is figuring out for ourselves which is which.
Lucky thing.
Patrick, he's...
You got the cash?
Don't worry.  It's just round the corner. Halfway down that block, you can't miss it.  Top step of the front stairs, there's a loose stone.  Go on, I ain't shitting you.
But maybe we're the ones who should be down there.  Doing something.  Making it better.
What are we doing down here?
Did you do it?
Please...help me...
That's all we did, steal their ride.
You haven't?
You gotta use your imagination.
It's not safe down there.  The fire started down there.  The whole thing could collapse.
Whoa, whoa.  Come on, he's making too much noise.
Admit what?
We know how this was done, eh?
We're family, Caesar.
She's doing the work herself.
Goddammit, Violet!  Would you just leave me the fuck alone!  Please! Leave!  Now!
All right, Johnnie, you want to play it this way, I can play it this way. You want to know who made a mistake, why don't you open the case.
Tell them!  Tell them!
No I didn't.  Not if his body disappears and not if the money is still here.  Then they never showed up.
Fuck.
What are you doing?
Saved me?  You don't even know me. You used me, Caesar, just like I used you.  All part of the business.
What?
We were in a car accident --
But everybody is all right.
Caesar, don't.
Not on duty, sorry.
Try to keep the extra batteries for your aid around.
You planned this whole thing, didn't you?
You're helping Rajeev?
How many'd you do?
Okay, sure, Mick.
I was buzzing, I was knocking, but I guess you couldn't hear me on account of being in the shower.
I started thinking maybe it's about the money so I call you, but all I get is the busy signal.  I figure the phone is off the hook, that's why I come rushing over here.
Hello?
We had a report of gunfire, so if you could --
Ma'am, you have to open the door.
Hi.  My name is Violet.  We sort of met in the elevator --
So this is temporary for you?
Oh, I'm sorry --
Caesar is your husband?
I'm sorry, I usually would call Rajeev, but I didn't know what to do so I called Mr. Bianchinni.
Okay, one drink.
Curious, maybe.
No.
Isn't that what you wanted to know? What I did time for?
That's what I tell someone when I'm trying to get them in my bed.
You didn't want to see me, did you?
What are you afraid of?
I don't understand - ?
I know what I am.  I don't need to have it tattooed on my shoulder.
We make our own choices and we pay our own prices.  I think we're more alike than you want to admit.
Fuck it!  I think you better leave.
For Shelly, taking the money was a way to take from Caesar.  He could have run at any time, but he didn't because he didn't want out.
Caesar lives for these moments.  He tells me it's just the business, but I know it's more than that.  He likes it.  The violence.  I'll catch him in the bathroom mirror touching his scars.  He says they remind him who he his.  They're all like that. Except maybe Mickey.
I want out.  I want a new life.  I see what I've been waiting for, but I need you, Corky.
Caesar will bring it to the apartment to count and go through |Shelly's books to figure out how he did it.
All you would need to keep yourself clean would be someone unconnected, someone like me.
What?
Gino Marzzone is coming tonight to pick up the money?
And Johnnie is his son, that's Johnnie Marzzone?
Gino Marzzone is coming to your apartment.  It's a big deal, isn't it?  That means Caesar will be ready. He doesn't want to look like an idiot. Gino has been there before?
What happened?
What time did you say they would be there?
Where will you be?
If you're this goddamn smart, how did you ever get caught?
I had a partner and she fucked me.
You know what the difference is between us, Violet?
Hey, Caesar!  You take care of this girl, or I find out!
Oh, God.
Mickey!  Oh God, Mickey!
I will never understand it, Mickey. You didn't even call the police.
Storm clouds are gathering, Ted. It looks like rain and I don't have a thing to wear.
Yes.
We've been down here for two weeks banging our heads against the wall. We've been <u>sleeping</u> down here.  We just got our first lead fourteen hours ago, and now? -- now that we <u>finally</u> have something to work with -- you want to bring planning personnel down here?  I'd rethink that.
I'm going to Paris.
That's all I get?
Did you bring investment advice for me tonight?  It was tax shelters, wasn't it?  Swiss debenture-swaps.
Who do you think sent me?
...yes -- oui -- uh...
Bonjour?  Monsieur?  Allo...
You call about Monsieur Kane?  John Michael Kane?
There was an accident.  On the motorway.  Apparently, he was killed instantly.  Really, I'm terrible sorry to be the one to tell you this...
We thought you were gone for good.
We just picked up a job quite like the one we were bidding for you. Gorgeous boat, hundred-and-seventy- five-foot pleasure cruiser.  I think we learned a few things that might allow us to make our proposal for your job, as I said, a bit more competitive.
I need a ride out of here.
What if I say no?
Just so you know, if you're gonna burn me on the money, you might as well kill me.  I was supposed to have this car back three days ago.  It's not my car.
Shit --  Can I tell you how much you're freaking me out?  Okay?  Because you are -- you're completely freaking me out.
I don't know.  I don't know who I am.
That's what I'm saying.
And you have no idea -- not a clue -- what came before that?
Well, this is great.  I'm sick of myself and you have no idea who you are.
People do amazing things when they're scared.
You were tired.  Here...  For twenty-thousand I like to throw in breakfast.  So what do you dream about?
Four-fifty.  That's the address...
Where?
This is your office?  God, you live like a monk...
See.  It's starting to come back, yeah?  You mind if I take a bath?
He came to kill us.
-- there's two of us -- we'll tell them -- we'll just --
-- we'll tell them what happened --
What is that?
<u>So what are we doing</u>?

Can I help you?
Shit, we didn't sign in.
Is this it? --  -- this is it, right? --
Get in the basement.
What the hell're you talking about?
Sir...
-- and they're sure it's him? --
It came from your hip.  Under the skin.  You have a bank in Zurich.  You remember Zurich?
Look, I'm just on this boat, okay? I'm an engineer.  Whatever this is, it's not for me to be involved, okay?
You drink rum?
What have you got there?
Mumble ... mumble ... mumble ... Tuttle
...ven't you?
I think you've got your T41 crystal inductor wired up to a reverse bobbin- threaded-solenoid-control. It's either that or a new washer.
Oh, yes. We've got everything here. Every bit of knowledge, wisdom, learning ... every experience, every thought neatly filed away.
Well not exactly. But, if you help us we'll help you. The Forces Of Darkness have won the day ... but, tomorrow is another one
And the cost of it all, Deputy Minister? Seven percent of the gross national produce ...
Please, I've got to find Jill.
Long time no see!
Triplets.
Sorry about that ... Mr Helpmann told me you were coming aboard - congratulations!
Terrific. I'm really glad you dropped by. Unfortunately, I don't have any time right now I've got a queue of customers to deal with - er, why don't we have a drink tonight?
OK. Come back this afternoon, about four o'clock. If you give me the number of the case, I'll have the dossier here waiting.  My tailor,... well worth the investment.
Please, Sam, we're going to have to be open to each other on this one. If you make a reputation with this case, it'll be at my expense.
Enough though, eh?
Tell me about Layton.
But surely, I mean, perhaps she just happened to live above the Buttles, and ...
Out of kindness.
So what are you going to do about her?
You mean you're going to invite her in so that she can spill the beans inside the department?
Say it was a mistake.
Jack, she's innocent!
Jack?... Jack?
You stupid bastard!
I've been to Information Adjustments. They sent me here. They told me you had a form I had to fill in.
You think these are tits don't you?
Don't litter my cab!
OK. What's in the parcel?
It's heavy.
They'll be there waiting.
Security.
Shit! The house is on fire!
Please, Jill ... I love you.
There are plenty of other safe places. Why don't we go back to my flat?
What happened to you after ...
Make yourself at home. Don't answer the phone or open he door to anyone. I won't be long.
Oh my God, a mistake!
Isn't it? Whose is it?
Oh, good!
But if they did promote you
Send it to somebody else. Send it to Buttle. It's his cheque.
Problem. She doesn't have a bank account.
I've go to accept that promotion to get behind this, haven't I?
You want to take my console into your office?
What?  Look, let me use the console for a few minutes.
How long will she he away?
Hello, Spiro. Merry Christmas.
You remember Samuel, my son.
What were we saying?
Actually, Alma, that's one of the little things I was dying to tell you ... Sam's been promoted to Information Retrieval.
Mother? Is that you?
It's a refund ... I'm afraid there was a mistake.
Whatever happened to you?
Ah ... hello, Mrs Terrain. SAM lets go of the parcel and pushes JILL away. She moves off.
I can't make up my mind whether to have a number one or a number two. What do you recommend, Spiro?
Numero huit, braised veal in wine sauce. 
That's all right Ida ... it's just that he's such an artist. To him, cutting is so crude ... so primitive.
I don't know which numero.
What the - ? How did you - ?
What is it?
Nice and easy now. Keep your hands where I can see them.
They're a bit overworked these days. Luckily I intercepted your call.
The pace?
What do they want you or?
You're late, Pierce. I know, but I can't fire you. I've got nobody to work sixteen XRay with Walls.
No, no, that's impossible.
Es impossible.
You know each other a long time?
It's okay, Kanita. Come on in.
Where is she?
So, Frank, am I going to live?
I can't wait all night, Young. I'm holding a priority and if you don't answer I'm going to knock you out of service.
You're going to three-four Avenue C, 17 year-old female cardiac arrest, no further information.
Let's do it!  It's Marcus, Love, only for you.
No. He's dead.
All right, all right, he's been snorting that Red Death stuff. Been going for four days.
Excuse me. You are a very kind man. I can see that. A man like you could not refuse a poor sick dying helpless man a small cup of water.
Sure, sure, give go.
Do you have any music?
He's very very sick.
It's the waiting that's killing me, not knowing, you know? It's really hard on my mother. The doctor doesn't think my father'll make it. He says he was dead too long, after six minutes the brain starts to die and once that goes, close the door.
He's dead, huh?
Yes?
He's better, isn't he?
I knew. I sensed it when I heard your voice.
Sleeping.
Not as good as Nino's.
You married?
It's been bad lately, but it's always bad.
Five years.
If I'm not back in fifteen minutes, hit the buzzer. That way she'll let me go.
You and CY have a nice talk? He tell you about Sunrise Enterprises, helping people? Well, I've seen him hurt people. Why are you following me?
What is it? You want to help me, you feel sorry for me? Keep it to yourself.
I heard CY Coates was brought in. He looked pretty bad.
You ever notice people who see shit always, are crazy?
He's not dead. It's a heroin overdose. Break out the Narcon.
Oh, Frank, you've got it bad, so much worse than I thought.
Look at that. A fat junkie. That's a first.
I'll drink to that.
Where you going?
The family know?
Oh Jesus, put her on the monitor. Where's the pediatric code cart?  Odette give me that tube. All right, flatline--let's do CPR. step back, Frank. How many months?
Fourteen. We finally got him a room upstairs. Should be up there in a couple of hours.
No.
I'm sorry.
C'mon, Tom, pick up a job.
Let's break something, Tom. Let's bust something, bomb something.
Look at that. Tell me that's a crazy person. Every move is calculated. He knows exactly what he's doing. This is the guy. I've been after him for weeks. He's quick, runs like a rat, tough for one person, but with two of us--
Believe me, it always works. The simpler, the better.
We're gonna save you, Noel. You're gonna be all right.  Do it, Tom! I'll call for fucking backup, I swear!
Don't push it, Larry.
Relax, it's a street job, easy except for the smell. We'll just throw him in back and zip over to Mercy--no blood, no dying, that's how I look at it. He's just a drunk.
Well why didn't you say so?
Faster! God!
Larry, swing over on Eighth. We're gonna hafta run one of these calls.
I'm not feeling very well, Larry. I say we go back to the hospital and call it a night.
Tell me, you ever think of doing anything else?
Jesus, Tom Walls, that crazy motherfucker.
Okay if I watch you tape that interview downstairs?
One source referred to it as a five billion dollar metal sculpture to ugly to look at and too big to bury.
How <u>you</u> doing?
Keep it to yourself.
Never to pretend to know more than I did.
Wait.
I don't like being handled.
Don't let your eyes go from the beginning of the sentence to the end like that.  You don't want to look shifty, do you?
Everybody has one like that.  I thought it was great when you started to laugh at the end.
I don't think so.
You know what I...
Okay.
It's Mr. Buddy Felton?
Eventually rising to...
You're saying the fact that you're gay had something directly to do with your promotions?
Hi.  Turn on your TV... <u>Good Morning America</u>, the <u>Morning News</u> and <u>Today</u> are all about to talk to Arnold Schwarzenegger and I think he's live on at least two of them.
Now listen, Arnold just said that he's been making three million a movie now.  But he's not ever gonna change.  He's still the same person when he was making two million dollars a movie.  He feels no different.  He also bought a brand- new condo with Maria, they gonna furnish tastefully.
He must have been great-looking, right?
I'd give anything if that were true.
Nine seconds.
Of course.
I write for you sometimes.
Sounds like you may be on to something.
You know you've had a strange day... I'd sleep on all these things you've been thinking.
Yes.
Do you feel good about it?
I don't know.  I may be in love with him.
What?
I know you care about him.  I've never seen you like this about anyone, so please don't take it wrong when I tell you that I believe that Tom, while a very nice guy, is the Devil.
How?
I've got to not say that aloud; it takes too much out of me.
Don't say anything about anything.
Why not try it for a few weeks?
You won't be able to stay mad at me, right?
It's an ethnic curl, I can't do anything about it.
All I know is that they've got to fire a large number of people... and they're not going by seniority. There's a recklessness in the air. They...
Okay.  I think I'd better be alone for a while.
We came from Washington.
How long has it been since you've been home.
This is a brutal layoff...And all because they couldn't program Wednesdays.
No, I don't.  He happens to deserve the credit.  He's right here.
I've got to tell Ernie...because there isn't enough time.
It's Aaron.
What are you dressed up for?  Oh, that's right -- because the Evening News is here this week.
Do you want him all the way to the car?
Yes.  That's right.
Oh, please.  So they were really impressed with you at work.
What if we just don't tell them anything anymore unless they let you do the story?
...good-bye then.
Why so glum?
You know, Tom, I feel a little proud when people comment on your looks.  Maybe you should feel that way.
As long as that's your only problem you're...
It must be nice to always believe you know better.  To think you're always the smartest person in the room.
Except I'm no good at what I'm being a success at.
Listen to me.  You keep on thinking I'm somebody ho lacks...confidence. That's not it.  I know I can talk well enough and I'm not bad at making contact with people, but I don't like the feeling that I'm pretending to be a reporter.  And half the time I don't really get the news I'm talking about.  It isn't that I'm down on myself.  Trust me, I stink.
I can't believe I'm really here.  No kidding.  If you're through work now --
Hi.
So he was indicted?
Give it to him -- so we can concentrate.
At work there's always this sort of film over you.
You okay?
I'll wait for you till seven.
Believe me, I wouldn't be doing this unless it was absolutely necessary. I have an idea for something.
I just read about it in a magazine and it affected me.
If I tell you, can you manage not to put it down or tell me why it won't work or is in bad journalistic taste or anything like that?
I'm not sure I dialed right -- Jane?
Maybe I'll get off work.  I'd like to go.
So you like me, huh?
I can't get away just yet.  I'm at Aaron's.
Uh-huh.
I feel terrible about what happened. What did he say?
What?
Why?
We disagree on how God-awful it was.  Why don't you come with me and we can disagree and get a tan at the same time?
I got promoted for things like that.
This is a one-way argument.  We've got six days; if you go and we fight and we hate it -- we'll come home.  If you don't go?  Well, that's a much bigger deal.  I go to London right after that. So, it'd be very big deal if you stay here.  The plane's boarding.  You're good at deadline.  Here's your ticket.
I knew what you meant.
I sure know that feeling.  Terrific work today.
That's enough.  That's enough.
If you were an artist you could have created something!
What are you doing here?
Well I'm done talking to you, what do I have to do, draw you a diagram!
Yeah, he's keeping an eye out, said he'd call us if he sees anything. That's about it for tonight.
What the hell's going on?
It's called spontaneity, Leonard. Get with the program.
Like it?  It's a masterpiece.  I've never seen anything like it before... and I hope I never see anything like it again. Walter smiles and looks at his creation -
Gee..twenty five dollars for something I made!
These guys came by to help me try out some of my new organic recipes.
More champagne, your majesty?
May I please have another little kiss?
Did you hear what he said?
Oh, I don't know.  Smart people. Creative people I guess.
I like you very much, Walter.
Because...  We're just friends.  That's all. Just friends. WALTER I get it.  I see the whole thing now. No one knows if Walter Paisley is born!
Here you go, enjoy.
Hi Walter...
Are you trying to be funny?
Are you alright?
Yeah, I'm feeling a lot better.
It will take years to make that many statues.  But your work would be featured.
Look at that, man.  Big deal.
I wonder what his deal is.
That's alright, we got a pressing engagement!
Yeah.
Did you hear that Mr. De Santis? Everyone's really crazy about Dead Cat.
Hiya Carla.
The question is what are you going to make next, Walter?  Did you make that dog yet, or that parakeet?  How about making something out of the cockroaches in your room?
It's hot in here...
Hello Leonard!  Beautiful morning, isn't it?
What do you have in the box?
Whatsamatter Leonard?
When Carla comes by I'll talk to her.  She'll make up some nice invitations.  We'll have them printed up.
What offers have you got for it? I won't be out-bidded.  I'm a wealthy man and I don't mind paying for something I want.
What do you want for it?  Two thousand? Three thousand?
Listen to me...I don't want to lose this piece -
Yes, you have.  Can I come in?
Did you see my cat?
Goddammit, where are you from, Mars?
I- don't know what you're talking about!
I don't think anyone gets what I said, their blank faces staring, mute, unfeeling -
With Dead Cat.  Like a breath of fresh air.  I could just - babble on about it for hours.
It's like...you've turned on.
I had a salami sandwich, Mrs. Swicker.
What's all the noise in here!
I look horrible.
Man has a complex.
No, we didn't.
Hey!  She wasted my dog!
Rich bitches.  They're a plague. They've gotta be stopped.
I... feel.... pretty.
Did you see a girl come by here?
Which way did she go?
Excellent.
Your parents are always going away for the weekend.  You're so lucky.
Dying.
Do you know what time it is?
What's Bobby gonna say?
What show is this?
Oh.  Who's in it?  I know what it is.  It's what's on instead of the movie.
What'd you dream about?
This?  This is you only weapon? Your puny faith?
Can we have a hot dog, please, medium rare, and a cup of joe?
You want some water or something?
They were vampires, weren't they?
You had a car full of stuff.  Were you leaving?
Pike, I don't think you're up to this.
Who?
Cool.  I could actually use a couple of Allen wrenches.  What do you need?
He did what he was supposed to.
Leave me alone.
I crashed your party.
You're staying here.  Some of them might not come after me.  If they don't this place is gonna turn into a total stain.
It has to be, like a socially conscious theme.
Bugs.
Let's meet tonight, okay?
You were supposed to be here at three.
Excuse me for having something important to do.
You look way pretty, Kim.
God, where the hell did you come from?  You scared me to death.
Am I in trouble or something?
What are you talking about?
I had a trust fund my great- grandfather, or maybe it was an inheritance, 'cause he's dead, and I spent it on shoes.
Wait a minute.  My birthright is in the graveyard?  Later not.
Let me get this straight.  You're like, this greasy bum, and I have to go to the graveyard with you 'cause I'm chosen, and there's vampires.
I had a dream once where I was... There was like, knights in it, and I worked in this bar.  And I... was fighting.  I'm always fighting. And there's a guy...  He's not always there, but he's horrible, all white, and he's always... trying to kill me.
How do you know all this?
Ow.
It's not pretty, but it does suit our purposes.
What, um...  What do we do?
Great.  First I have a birthright, now I've got a fate.  Hey, do I have to take notes on this?
If I say 'no' does that make me a bad person?
Same one.
What!?!
I mean, most of the time Jeffrey's really sweet, but sometimes he gets kind of... 'Me-Tarzan'ish, you know what I mean?  Lately it bugs me, I guess.  Merrick?  Are you still breathing?
There isn't time.
Football is my life.
Cool.  We can figure decorations and stuff.
But as long as there have been vampire, there has been the Coven; the line of Slayers.  Ones with the strength and the skill to kill them, to find them where they gather and stop the swell of their numbers. One dies, the next is called.
Well, I'm done.  Are you done?
Okay, let's go.
Oh, God.
If we don't invite all the seniors we can't use the school funds, you know that.
All right.  Take care of yourself.
You said "Crash".
God, I never thought of that.
The ida originates at the right testicle and terminates at the left nostril.
You're patronizing me!  I will not be patronized--
God...I think I'm gonna be sick--
Death is like spring training?
I'm yours.
Breathing through your pingala always works, honey--
How 'bout a back rub?
Fundamentals?
Crash once called a woman's, uh-- pussy--y'know how the hair kinda makes a "V" shape?--
No!  You're playing with my mind!
He did?
I'd like you to meet my father.
Aw hell, let's have a quickie right here--
It's Skip, for you.
Well I guess this is it.
Neither will I.
You didn't get "lured".  Women never get lured.  They're too strong and powerful for that. Now say it--"I didn't get lured and I will take responsibility for my actions".
You should be at the game.
She's dancing with me.
After 12 years in the minor leagues, I don't tryout.  Besides-- I don't believe in, Quantum Physics when it comes to matters of the heart...or loins.
Damn.
Crash...I want you.
I thought you wanted an "uncomplicated" boy?
Why baseball?
Thurman Munson.  He was covered with dirt and he was fighting with everybody--it was beautiful ...  And he called the ump a cocksucker and got thrown out of the game even though it was an exhibition!  So I stayed in the bleachers all spring and gradually came to understand what's so great about baseball.
I don't know if I'd go that far.
Why not?
Ninety-five miles an hour.
Oh dear....easy honey...
Let's have a quick word of prayer, right here, to thank the Lord for all this--
Sweetie, have you ever heard of Walt Whitman?
Well, he sort of pitches for the Cosmic All-Stars.
What's that?
No, that is not belief.  That is desperation.
Did you call me a cocksucker?
You missed the tag!
Call me a cocksucker and you're outta here!
Why you shaking me off?
You're weird, man--I want a ice skater real bad.
What would you think of a pitcher who wore women's panties?
I was playing naked.
Annie says her panties will keep one side of my brain occupied while I'm on the mound, thus keeping my brain slightly off center, which is where it should be for artists and pitchers.  She also said I should throw whatever pitches you call for.
Why?!  I'm finally throwin' the damn thing where I want to.
Club's expanding its roster to finish the season--
No.
I'll take you back to the hotel.
Nuke...tell me something.  Did you hit me with your right or your left?
I have been known, on occasion, to howl at the moon.  D'you understand that?
I don't know.  I haven't caught anything yet.
Don't try me.
I gotta go now, Dad.
No.  If I screw up, I wanta do it alone.  I'll call.
He's got a million dollar arm and a five cent head.
Sears sucks, Crash, I tried it once.  Sold Lady Kenmores--it's nasty, nasty work.
It's a miracle.
What'you want, kid?
Ain't here.
Well, I'd rather not say.
Thank you.
I mean, the guy is history as far as I'm concerned. History.
Hey, I need a room. Need a room.
The only time I was at the Tangiers was when I had dinner with Barney Greenstein.
You were wandering around.
As far as the world was concerned Andy Stone, the head of the Teamsters' Pension Fund, was a legitimate guy.
He even played golf with the President.
But Andy also took orders. And when he was told to give a pension fund loan to Philip Green...
He's on all night, screamin' about how he's gonna take his damn lawsuit all the way to the Supreme Court. He really must be crazy. He's gonna go to Washington with this?  He's out of his fuckin' mind.
Know what my problem is? Every time they mention my name in the papers, these cocksuckers, they mention Nicky, too. How the fuck does that help?  I mean, the heat he brought down is murder!  We had a police department who was cooperative. He's pissed them off so much now that nobody can make a move anymore. I mean, what do you do about that?
Oh, good.
Yeah.
Yeah, is this Lester? This is Sam...
...by the only kind of guys that can actually get you that kind of money: sixty-two million, seven-hundred thousand dollars. I don't know all the details.
Sure, you have my permission. But I - I just gotta tell you it's no joke out here. It's no joke, you know? You gotta keep a low profile. It's not like back home. Right off the bat, they don't like guys like us. And this sheriff's a real cowboy. Even the coppers aren't afraid to bury people out in the desert here.
I mean, Nicky's a made guy and I'm not. I can't do that.
So, I'm lucky. I'm not allowed to get lucky in this place?
No, I didn't know that. But you know what he did?
What?
It just didn't sink into his head about the Black Book and what it meant. Not being able to go into a casino is just one thing, but being in this book etched your name into the brains of every cop and FBI agent in the state. I mean, you're listed in there with Al Capone. But Nicky didn't care.
Hello.
...very difficult to get in.
Fuck the FBI! That prick's been dodging me for three weeks. And what is it with you?  All of a sudden, you're tryin' to tell me what to do all the time.
You should say so.
All right, fine.
My wife?
This guy is gonna run to the FBI.
I knew what he wanted, and I didn't want any part of it.
...on the line and this guy's out havin' the time of his life. He has every cop in the state watchin' him, and he's out playin' golf.
Where the fuck you get off talkin' to people about me behind my back? Goin' over my head?
What people! What'd you think, I wasn't gonna find out?
Oh, I don't know whether you know this or not, but you only have your fuckin' casino because I made that possible!
You know I get calls from back home every fuckin' day?!  They think you went batshit!
Ginger called me.
I just told you. She called me.
She was afraid to call you.
I think if you, uh, okay it, you know, assure her that she's gonna be all right, she'll come back.
Yeah, what are you doin'? You okay?
Ace don't... listen, don't... don't make a scene, all right?
She didn't know who to turn to.  She... she didn't know where to turn. She was tryin' to save your marriage.
Well, could there be any position... further down the trough?
Okay. You come by the house?
Oh, yes. Will you help me fold these, please?
This is Jennifer and Nick. They're dear friends of mine.
You know, I don't feel like playin' tennis.
Let's go to lunch. Do you want to go to the Riviera?
Hello.
Charlie, you've gotta - you've gotta stop her!
Help the Senator, give him whatever he wants.
This woman's an institution.
Sam, we got a problem.
Yeah, Billy Sherbert, please. Put him on.
She took care of the dealers...
...pit bosses, floor managers.
...she took care of the valet parkers, the guys who could get you anything and take care of anything.
Within no time, everything was set in place. We got rid of the freelance scamsters. The per was way up.  The gods were happy, or as happy as the gods can ever be.  And I, I decided to complicate my life. For a guy who likes sure things, I was about to bet the rest of my life on a real longshot.
You don't know me. What, you've known me, two, three months. What do you know?
You know a lot of happily married people, Sam? 'Cause I don't.
I care about you, a - But I just don't have those kind of feelings for you. I'm sorry. I'm not in love with you.
What're you... what're you pitching me, here?
You're with me now.
Well, I mean... you know, I gotta ask you. That's a lot of money. You're not asking for a box of popcorn, you know. I mean...
Well, if you want a coat, you got it. You know that. It's not the money, it's just why do you want it?  That's all I'm askin'. Am I not entitled to that?
You're askin' me for twenty-five thousand. I'm not out to make you feel bad. I want to just be able to trust you. You now, it's about trust. I have to be able to trust you with my life. Do you understand? Can I trust you?  Can I trust you?... Can I trust you?... Answer me. Can I trust you?
I was just tryin' to help him. It's not like I'm sleeping with the guy!
If not for me, at least for Amy.
You see, if a phone's tapped, the Feds can only listen in...
Well, that's why I'm here. She wants to come back, but she's afraid you're gonna whack her out.
Hello.
...I-I... made some mistakes and I spent some money.
...under?
How serious?
Yeah.
Twenty-five thousand for clothes.
Twenty-five thousand for clothes and a watch.
Yeah.
Plus, at the most, three suits, a thousand apiece. That still leaves what?  Around ten thousand?
You're lower than a dog!
I am. I'm wakin' her up right now.
I had a... salad.
Fine.  Just gonna get the bowl for my thing.
All right... I didn't have lunch with Jennifer.
She wasn't gonna get up. I was just gonna be out for a little while.
Oh, sh-
I'll sign anything you want me to sign, okay?
Now you need approval from him to go home?
...'Ace' Rothstein, accused the state's top gaming officials of corruption.
- you could put 'em on your expense account?
Uh, I'm very proud to say that we have eight children.
All right, I will, I will.
The probability on one-four-reel machine is a million and a half to one. On three machines in a row, it's in the billions.  It cannot happen... would not happen, you fuckin' momo! What's the matter with you!  Didn't you see you were bein' set up on the second win?
Ah, yes, here we are. A little craps figures.  [Actual amount taken from craps tables before the skim.] Hey - Hey.
We had to make an example of these pricks that the party was over.
Look what they did to my hand, man!
A couple of guys, I owe them. So, that's what I did. I gave 'em the money.  That's what I did.
Fuckin' kids at home!  Here.  Get the fuck out of here.
Artie, no records, Artie. What are you gonna do with records? Pay taxes?
No, I don't want one.  Hey, Mr Clark, how you doin'?
I've been trying to reach you. You're tougher to get than the President.
Yeah, least you could do is return my phone calls, though.
No, you can, you can.  You've been so nice to me.
All right. Okay, okay.
There's nothing we can do. She had the key.
Beautiful. You got a beautiful swing.
You know, he's gotta realize everything can't be a home run that he does.
It's instinctive, you know.
I had my kid brother, Dominick, run it for me.
Forget about it, Nick. Don't let it bother you.
Carmine left?
He's not here?
We're placing you under arrest for aiding and abetting -
It's in all the papers.
Frankie, I want to ask you something.
But back then the bosses didn't give a fuck about whether he enjoyed himself of not. To them, he was a cash register. All they had to do was ring the bell and take the money. Especially Remo, who was a fuckin' degenerate gambler who always lost.
Uh-huh. Good.
Sure.
I can see that. Sure.
Listen, Ginger... you know, this is probably not... I don't have the answers anyway... and this is probably not what you want to hear right now, because you're a little upset with Ace.
Thank you.
You just relax. Nobody's killin' anybody, do you hear?
What were you gonna say? Go ahead.
You did. I like that. I like that. That's what I like about you. You did the right thing.
Yes, you did.
I'm not and he scares the shit out of me. I never know what he's gonna do.
Hey, don't be such a fuckin' smartass, will you?  I mean, I know the fuckin' guy thirty-five years, I'm gonna fuckin' whack him for you?  Fuck... motherfucker! I knew this, I knew it.
I'm sorry.
Thank you, sir, I appreciate that. Everybody, thanks. Gives some chips as tips to the dealer and box man. Thanks. Take care, Steve. Take chances and drive fast.
Come on.
What do you mean, 'What's the matter?' I made a lot of money for you. I want my cut.
Yes.
Well, how 'bout that?
So, it's gonna be okay, isn't it?
I just talked to him.
- back to  Nigeria.  Yeah.
Look, there aren't...  There aren't but...
How many of these you gonna eat, huh?
'Cause it clogs up your heart.
Well, how come I laid nine?
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Come here, come here.
Whenever we got local merch, we'd usually send it to Palm Spring or Arizona... LA. I had a couple of sand niggers out there. You know, Arabs.
Mm.
Oh, God! Give me the fuckin' name!
Tony.
I'm positive.
I'm sorry, Nicky. I didn't mean anything by it.
Again!
I've never trusted him. And you know I got eyes...
Take it easy, though.
...everything's comin' out of my pocket. I gotta pay for all these trips back and forth, back and forth.
Have we reached the epi-center?
Cactus, I can't believe you just said all that...
How heroic of you...
You designed Gotham Plaza?  The big silver guys pulling on those big silver things...
I'm sorry I went off like that, I get passionate. I--I guess I'm a passionate person. One of those things I had forgotten.  When you were a little boy did you want to grow up to be a superhero?
Oh now, you put up a good fight. Let's change the subject. Where do people who live in Oasisburg go to get away from it all?
You're right, I wasn't looking to fall in love with a casino worker. I'd given up trying to find anyone. But there was a fire in your eyes that cut right through the air conditioning and through the coldness of my heart.
You've lost all motor functions. The poison will kill you in ten minutes.
"Dat's gotta hurt!"
Not now, Mammoth. Adonis is right. We've had a good run here--the protection kickbacks from the crime syndicates, the merchandising scams-- Tomorrow night we have a big, violent, complicated and lucrative mission to pull off. We chould be resting up.
Cactus--shooting a man in the back is not very noble.
Car wash, Captain?
The Tranquilizer Tranquility will hold for about an hour..where is she? These women are out here on a lark-- Ladies Night at a discotheque.  It's not in their blood the way it is for Catwoman...Where is she?
Hasn't anyone ever taught you that fighting violence with violence solves nothing.
Yes. I am the reporter or the architect.  You've been through so much..It looks like you've used up all nine of your lives...
I'm supposed to be taking personality tips from you three?  You people were once heroes. You had ideals.  You fought for things.  Spooky told me so...
Spooky.
Oh, what?  I offer you a job in implied exchange for physical favors and suddenly it's "sexual harassment..."
How much?
Nothing. How's your hand?
You are...
Some reporter I am..all this time my story is right there in front..I have a lot of questions.
It's seeing-eye dogs, ma'am. If I let the cat stay, will you go out with me?
You're late.
A hearty breakfast is the start of a great morning...
Maybe.
I don't know if I can do it alone.
What's it like being a superhero?  It must be frightfully exciting..How did you guys all get together?
Nice breasts.
I'm sorry for whatever's happened to you but we're definitely not the right people to do you any good.
What are you doing on Theo's line?
What was that for?
I know you feel awful but it's not your responsibility.
You gotta just look the other way.
We've already got an ambulance on the way.  Don't try to get out.
What'd you do?  Tail me from Brentwood?
Nels reporting in.  Sit down where you are.  Arms folded.
Which is why we had a lot more to worry about than the law.  These are people who don't worry about reading you your rights.
Now turn around.  I'm going to cuff you.
You never miss a trick.
That was definitely out of line and totally unprovoked.  I heard you were a hitter.
What do you mean tip the cops?  Is the man a lunatic or what?
Just hand up on the bitch!  Fuck you, madam.  And goodbye!
And stop with the directions.
That's illegal.  You want us pulled over?  I'll turn around at the corner if you'll shut the fuck up.
We still gotta run the drill before we walk in that lobby.
Got your badge?
Lose the hardware now.
If this is some sales pitch I'm not buying --
Well I'm not tolerant of being bothered with this bullshit story when I'm about to make the most important score of my life.  This has gotta be some "put-on," right?
Don't expect me to tell you who I am.
Where'd they take you to?
The cops could trace this call back to you.
What makes you say that?
Fine, no tunnel.  Are you still with me?  Hello?
What do they need her for?
The bigger man is driving our Mercedes to the school.  Rachel will recognize the car.  She'll get right in.
He's right.  You'll get my whole family killed.
What do you think I'm doing?  I'm on my way to the school like you wanted.
Where's the fucking recharger cord?  Must be in her car, dammit.
Our house always needs touching up.
I suppose if you're a struggling artist you need a patron.
There are cables overhead.  Hang on.  It'll clear up.
Which means you can't be more than five or ten minutes from here.
What's going on?
It won't be him.
I've got a lot of respect for you too.  For the way you feel about your family.
Thank you.  God bless you for helping us.
Yes sir.
Can you walk?
She's a child.  She might panic. She doesn't know me.  She might not come to me.  She might just run.
The guy with the transplant.
And all that crap about your driver being murdered by a cop --
Sit completely still with both hands on the wheel -- until they get here.
Nobody's easier to con than a con man.
Your friends are probably still on the line.  Pick it up and say hello.
Not all.  They already have a third.  The question is how much of that are they willing to give to get you back?
We might hit a bump and the gun might go off.  Ever see that Tarantino movie -- where Travolta blew that guy away in the back seat -- purely by accident?
It could be a fire.  This is Malibu.
Any idea where you're going?
Who'd ever think, to look at you?
That's a reasonable possibility.
Both hands on your lap.
Just sitting here listening to her voice does it to me all over again.  No harm admitting I fell in love with the sound of you.
Think about what's going to happen to your valuables when that trunk flies open at 75 miles per?
Thank God -- thank God I've got you.
They saw you kill the driver.
You're walking away with a clear fifty percent and a guarantee nobody can afford to I.D. you.
Pass.
I'm here.  Where are you?
I don't want you within two hundred feet.  Park down by the lifeguard station.  Nobody gets out.
I don't want to see her later.  I want to hear her <u>now</u>.
I don't know what you mean.
Be careful in disposing of them. You'll have to discount 'em. You'll be lucky to clear a hundred and a quarter.
Negative.
What's he doing?  Answer me!
You researched me.  You know where I live.  She'll be waiting for you there along with your split.
That bitch.  What's keeping you from taking off?
Not without the name of the contact who can discount the bonds.  I may need to pry that information out of her.  What do you stand to gain?
How far off are you?
Something was rattling around. Some loose tools.
What kind of Treasury Dept. business is this?
I thought so.
The 405 is coming up.
You could always make it up to her.
When a girl runs out like that, she generally wants to be followed.
What you think?
Ask him.
Don't want any of those looks, Col. They don't mean much.
Jimmy.
See, they get the wrong idea.
Fuck off back to Essex!
You American?
Hi.
You want me to ask you in, right?
Make a pass or something. Isn't that the way it goes?
Jesus Christ!
That Dave?
Piss off, Dave!
Would you like a drink?
He was different.
No.
No --
So what do you want with me, Jimmy?
You mean that?
The thing is, can you go the distance?
Why?
Tell him to stop messing Dil around --
Ask me to meet you again, Jimmy.
Know what I didn't know. And don't call me that.
Details, baby, details.
Won't be quite the same though, will it?
No. Can't pretend that much.
Come on.
And you're not going to tell me more?
What you doing, Jimmy?
Don't call me that --
You heard what I said, Dil?
Are you all right, Dil?
Good-bye, Dil
What?
Dil Can I tell you something? I knew your man.
Your soldier.
Lifted him from a carnival in Belfast. Held him hostage for three days.
Died...
You killed my Jody?
See, I fix on anyone that's nice to me. Just the littlest bit nice and I'm yours.
More endearments.
What's Fergus?
You've got to go now, Dil --
Promise?
Sorry, love. Now, the white ones are magnesium supplement --
Lucky you.
Fergus!
Have a look at him.
Tough work, that.
No. That's the last thing I'll do. You never asked what happened.
Maguire and me got out by the skin of our teeth. No thanks to you.... What you think of the hair?
But you know what the thing is, Fergus?
We've got some plans here. And we'll need a Mister Nobody to execute them.
But, then, I don't have a choice.
Give him a cup of tea.
So?
Yes.
Why?
What?
You sure about that?
Hope not.
So it's on the street.
What do you mean you can't?
This is a farce, man.
Thank you, handsome.
How did you know it was her?
Well, I could say the same about you.
You're going to have to do it, aren't you?
What makes you think that?
They won't let him die.
Why can't we?
C'mere.
"Go back to your banana tree, nigger." No use telling them I came from Tottenham.
Best game in the world.
Nice to meet you, Fergus.
Fergus?
Having two pints in the Rock.
Oh, yeah.
The best.
I didn't.
Take the whole lot. I won't need it.
Help me.
Like the one about the frog?
When I was a child...
Cause you're my friend. And I want you to go to the Metro --
Hurling's a fast game, isn't it, Fergus?
Used to run the mile, you know -- four times round the cricket pitch -- what was that game called?
What if I did?
Not here.
I said shut the fuck up --
That fucker's dead --
No -- I guess not.
Oh, you should see your face.
You don't look so bad in this light.
Oh? Did they do that sort of thing way back in your day?
I know why you're not taken -- no one can catch up with you.
I just heard from him -- he's still hungry. That means killing Gideon didn't get it for him -- so he's narrowed it down to us. You've got it.
But everyone and his Aunt Lilian's been through that bag. Somebody would have seen it.
Reggie -- I think I've found --  are you on?
Grandpierre asked me about an appointment Charles had -- on the day he was killed.
as outlined in report number three- nine-stroke-five-two of the Western Hemisphere Conference held on March 22 --  no wait! It was last Thursday, five o'clock at the Jardin des Champs- Élysées! Adam -- that was it! The garden!
Well, you're right there. Ten minutes ago I had a job.
But I didn't kill anybody.
Reggie -- listen to me!
Reggie -- trust me once more -- please.
Then say it.
I'm sorry -- my secretary must have gone to lunch. You are -- ?
To be more specific, he was wanted by this agency.
Why not?
Yes, but I lost him. I really did it quite brilliantly. I'm beginning to think women make the best spies.
Well -- he's tall -- over six feet -- rather thin -- in good physical shape, I'd say -- dark eyes -- quite handsome, really.
I wouldn't advise that, Mrs. Lampert. You'd better consider what happened to your husband when he tried to leave. Those men won't be very far away -- no matter where you go. In fact, I don't even see any point in your changing hotels. Please help us, Mrs. Lampert. Your government is counting on you.
That's the spirit.
Calm down, Mrs. Lampert -- please. Does he have the money?
The envelope -- imagine that.  Mrs. Lampert, listen to me -- you're not safe as long as you've got these stamps. Go to the Embassy right away -- wait, I'd better meet you halfway -- it's quicker. Now, let's see -- do you know the center garden at the Palais Royal? -- yes, by the colonnade -- as soon as you can get there. Hurry, Mrs. Lampert.
Yes -- and he was there, too -- a little fatter now -- and less hair -- but it's the same one.
No.
You couldn't even be honest about being dishonest. Why didn't you say something?
Bartholomew?
Is there a Mrs. Cruikshank?
What now?
How long do you intend -- ?
Supposing I did have it -- which I don't -- do you really think I'd hand it over?
Your --
Are you really Carson Dyle's brother?
Sure.
Is there a Mrs. Dyle?
I'm sorry I couldn't tell you the truth, but I had to find out your part in all this.
There's an old riddle about two tribes of Indians -- the Whitefeet always tell the truth and the Blackfeet always lie. So one day you meet an Indian, you ask him if he's a truthful Whitefoot or a lying Blackfoot? He tells you he's a truthful Whitefoot, but which one is he?
Because he's wearing moccasins.
Why not a lying Blackfoot?
What day is it?
Who do you think did it -- Gideon?
Don't worry, I'm not going to hit you.
Maybe somebody felt that four shares were too many --
What? Assassinate somebody?
Reggie -- open the door.
What are you doing?
In your money, perhaps $65,000.
In human life? In greed? In suffering?
Let me see. There are 350 European, 200 Asian, 175 American, 100 African and twelve Princess Grace commemorative -- which comes to nine francs fifty.
Mrs. Lampert --
Didn't Charles tell you, Mrs. Lampert?
Oh. Swiss. His profession?
About how wealthy would you say?
Besides yourself, who is his nearest relation?
Obviously.  One ticket of passage to South America -- one letter, stamped but unsealed, addressed to you --
Swell -- only this man doesn't have a garden.
Voilà what?
But he is gone.
Well, you're honest, anyway.
I'm not sure I --
It's terrible -- you just made it up.
Are you in the book?
Where did everything go?
Come on. You can't stay here.
We'll find you a hotel.
You mean you and me?
Stop this nonsense! If you're in some sort of trouble I want to know about it.
What was it?
On the street where you live.
How would you like a punch in the nose? Stop treating me like a child.
Hey -- I'm on your side. Remember that.
Can you give me one good reason why I should?
With a rich husband and this year's clothes you will not find it difficult to make some new friends.
He knows everything.
Yeah?
One more time.
You aren't planning to tell these kids that 'virgin' was tattooed into both Stacy and Rod, are you?
She's my daughter, Tom.
Your curfew is 9:30 and you know it, little miss.
Hi honey.
What did you hear?
No!
Did you warn her?
What are you doing?
Of what?
No.
Really?
Pay no attention to me.
Please get out of my way or I'll have to hurt you.
You aren't going to the party?
We're all manipulated. From the moment we're born. The event that fatalistically shaped my life happened before I was even born.
What do you know about my father?
Mark Shale.
You're so fucking lucky your dad is the sheriff.
You get to be a little Chelsea Clinton. Everyone wants to meet you. Party with you. Have sex with you.
Someone tried to kill me.
You ok?
Mark invited me to the party.
Shh. Ben's party. Tonight. Haven't you heard?
I kind of like the idea that we can all lose it together, on the same night. It'll be a lot less scary. You have to go.
Kenny'll want to go with you. Cindy's holding a Q and A session at the bleachers. Come on.
They're all on microfiche. What year are you looking for?
This place is empty.
Cut it out.
I heard you got attacked.
You know I want to go with you.
If you don't want to go with me just say so. Say 'Kenny, I DON'T WANT TO MAKE LOVE TO YOU' but don't use your dad as an excuse. I'm so sick of it.
Are you coming to the party?
Please don't go. Please. Stay, We'll just talk. Then go to the party.
Where are you going?
Years ago, something horrible happened in this town. When I was still in high school. A girl named Elizabeth Sherman was attacked by four drunken seniors.
They were proving to her they weren't. They were very drunk. Things were different back then. You think kids are sexually bottled up today....
EVERYONE JUST KIND OF LOOKED THE OTHER WAY.
Yes?
On what side of the family?
Yeah I was talking about Twinkies the other day and I realized I hadn't had one in years. Then I remembered seeing you with one.
There's Jan and Heather. Let's grab them quick before someone else does.
Aren't you worried you could die a virgin?
On our way home, a drunken driver could hit us head on and send us flying through the windshield. Terminate us instantly. We'd never experience what it means to make love.
A little early for a delivery.
Where's Sam?
The guy's a fuckin' moron.
Huh?
Sorry, man.  He's dead.
I need your truck.
You are seriously mistaken if you think you are going anywhere in my...
Look...I got two tons of the world's nastiest ice cream sittin' in a truck that should've been retired ten years ago.  That shit will be worthless by noon.
...doing?!
Look, put this in the back.  Keep it safe.
You gave him ice cream, didn't you?  Come on, let's go.
That dog ain't mean.

I ain't goin' through Missoula!
You stole this truck!
...the ice cream for money!
I'm about to get in your ass like last year's underwear, man.
Shut up.
What?
...I'm not the psycho.
...-er!
I did not steal the truck.
...waiting!

That's right.  Now,  move!
 Okay.
...Pete.  Come on.
Ho, ho...

Oh, Pete.  Oh, shit!  Oh, shit!
All right.
Yeah, he's a dangerous...

Oh, shit!
Oh, no!

Hey, I told you I did not steal that truck.  Andy owes me a lot more than that four-wheeled...
...just ready to just slide him right in there.  And what about me, huh?  What about Arlo, huh?  What about my needs? You know, I got a-I got student loans...
You know, four years ago, I was a split end at Kentucky State.
Never gonna throw a ball in the pros.
And  things sort of just went downhill from there.
Well, all the same.  If we get to Missoula, help me find a car.  I'd appreciate it.  Then...you can...
Split?  I wouldn't get ten...

A-And you  owe me...
 

Hey, just shut up.
Hey, hey, hey.
Okay. 

Come here.
You just can't leave that stuff with that lu-...
Go!
Aw, shit.  Would you be more care-...
What the hell?
Mason.

What?
Well, hell, the smoke's gonna kill us anyway!

 Well.
You know, we saved half a million people from a full-body peel.
Stop limpin' around like that.
...and-and-and truckless in the service of my country...
...face" crap you've been telling me?
...-tiatin'.
We're worried...
 Just give me Elvis and I'll make sure you have enough money for a dozen ice cream trucks.
Your move.  Okay, Vaughn, you drive.


...take my sorry old truck.
...here.   Mason... 
You got a prob-...
Your country and a lot of innocent people in it...
...-listed personnel with detailed knowledge of classified secrets falling under the National Security Act.

Colonel Vitelli.  We got a busted-in cold vault inside.
Doc-...
...the United States into the kind of country we're supposed to be fighting against.
Now listen to me.

...-ple.
Brynner.
Good to see you again, Leo.
I can't say it's a surprise.
As soon as I heard Elvis was on the loose, you came to mind.
Get 'em on line, then stall.  Long can't have gotten far.
 There's nothing in here, sir.  They got away with it.
Besides, how are we gonna sell something we don't have?


 Move.  This is already affecting our schedule.
Dennis, radio the bikes.  I wanna know if so much as a squirrel...
Carl, establish contact with that deputy we met earlier.  He'll be more useful now.
Hit him again.
This was supposed to be a...
Having witnessed the effects myself, I can assure you it'll be very useful when the bidding starts.
I'm on it.
...-mand out of Fort Bragg.
Hemmings!  Sam, I thought I told you to close up shop and be ready to move up the island by night-...
Uh, with all due respect, sir, Dr. Long told me to prep the field for detonation at...
...gear?
....-lene.
I beg your pardon?
Actually, I was just looking for a restroom.
Doc...
...your concern nor your fight.  Relinquish the package and you can go.
Dead, last time I...


Why?  You're a nothing, nobody!  Why?
I would've in another life.
...-fore he closes, which means you're gonna have to cover the grill and the floor.
And don't give him any ice cream...
Oh, caught a few, lost a few.
Uh, we both like to fish.
...tight!
Missoula's reporting the refrigerator truck as a stolen vehicle.  I told you Mason was walking shit.
And where are you going?
What the hell are you talkin' about...
...-five.
A man named Tim Ma-...
Hey, doc.  Might wanna...
...-time. 
...like a fish.
...is a perfect hunter.
Turn the power of the hunter against him.
...create a piece of bait that sends the fish's instincts into overdrive...
Some people might say you're readin' an awful lot in-...

...-m-means, Mason.  
What?  Say again, Ma-...
What we gave Brynner on the dam was a phony!
So you don't remember...
Lying? 
I said let me see your hands now!
 Wait.  Listen to me, Pappas.  If you don't let us by...
Yeah, I'm sure.


Gimme this god-...

Uh, so head for the other end of the tunnel.
Negative.  Negative.
Now!  Seal that tunnel now!
An honest living.
But I'm surprised you're still working for her, unless she's suddenly come up with another husband.
How did she get that idea?
Lou Escobar – he's a Lieutenant.
Oh yes.
Far as it goes. Of course he has to swim in the same water we all do.
Doesn't that strike you as odd?
Sheriff's gold posse... bunch of damn fools who pay $5,000 apiece to the sheriff's reelection. I let 'em practice up out here.
Just find the girl.
Where is she?
An obituary column... can you read in this light?
There's going to be some irate citizens when they find out they're paying for water they're not getting.
How much are you worth?
She's just no good.
That's a filthy habit.
Yes.
That's just lovely.
Where did you get this material?
I'd like to talk to him.
What are you doing here?
Yeah, I took 'em. So what?
You really think I'm stupid, don't you, Gittes?
I want those photographs, Gittes. We're talking about accessory after the fact, conspiracy, and extortion. Minimum.
No, Gittes, you'll show us.
Get him away from her. He's responsible for everything. Get him away from her!
But I thought you'd hired a private investigator.
Mr. Gittes.
Will you need me for anything else, Lieutenant?
Iced tea.
Well, that little girlfriend, she was attractive in a cheap sort of way of course.  She's disappeared. Maybe they disappeared together somewhere.
Thank you for going along with me. I just didn't want to explain anything... I'll send you a check.
I got your check in the mall.
Stop it. The money's fine. It's generous but you've shortchanged me on the story.
Sorry. Look, you sue me, your husband dies, you drop the lawsuit like a hot potato, and all of it quicker than wind from a duck's ass. Excuse me. Then you ask me to lie to the police.
I don't like the word 'cheat.'
I can't tell you.
Your father is Julian Cross, isn't he?
Over the water department, or over you?
Oh, yeah?
That dam is a con job.
In the last three months, Robert Knox has bought 7,000 acres, Emma Dill 12,000 acres, Clarence Speer 5,000 acres, and Jasper Lamar Crabb 25,000 acres.
We got it. We got it, baby.
You're looking at the owners of a 50,000 acre empire.
Maid's night off?
When was the last time?
Boy oh boy, you're a mess.
Hold still. Why?
...No. Why was it.
And I want to know where.
This morning.
Okay, give me the keys.
It's either that or you drive to the police yourself.
Just tell me the truth. I'm not the police. I don't care what you've done. I'm not going to hurt you, but one way or another I'm going to know.
Did you have lunch? Kyo will fix you something.
Don't worry. I can recommend a couple. They're expensive but you can afford it.
...he had a breakdown... the dam broke... my mother died... he became a little boy... I was fifteen... he'd ask me what to eat for breakfast, what clothes to wear!... It happened... then I ran away...
Let me handle that.
Walsh here?
Sophie.
Oh yeah? You pick up the watch?
Sophie... is Walsh there?... yeah, listen, pal, Escobar's going to try and book me in about five minutes... relax, I'll tell you. Wait in the office for two hours. If you don't hear from me, you and Duffy meet me at 1712 Alameda.
Hello, Miss Sessions. I don't believe we've had the pleasure.
I understand... if you could tell me who employed you, Miss Sessions. That could help us both.
Yeah, Sophie.
There's just one question.
That's exactly what we wanted to hear.
I wonder, is it too late for us to have a look around?
Would you mind if we took a stroll on our own?
Hard working, have a wife and kids...
Mr. Gittes?
The water.
Yeah? Ain't that something? Middle of a drought, the water commissioner drowns. Only in L.A.
It's bone dry, Morty.
Then go home and forget about it.
No problem with me on the Job.
Never heard of 'em... new owners?
He owned the entire water supply for the city?
Mulwray? I thought you said Cross owned the department.
What about?
Look, Jake. She gave us Mulwray's real phone number and address.
No, no. She said not to call, her husband might answer.
So he says you sent them?
Think you can nail Mulvihill? They'll claim you were trespassing.
What's that, pal?
Is the Pope Catholic? Who are you, mister?... I ask because he doesn't see a whole lot of people.
She must be about thirty-three, thirty- four.
That's for sure.
'Cause sometimes you can't find the right place any more and so...well, actually...they stay here.  Besides, there are more kisses than you can count.
Alfredo, did you know my father?
Good for you, Toto. Good for you... I'm only saying this for your own good...  Cooped up in here you die of heat in the summer and of cold in the winter. You breathe in smoke, gas fumes, and earn practically nothing. 
You understand which side the gelatin's on?
You understand now? You see it clearly?
My name's Salvatore...And yours?
No particular reason...  Nice day, huh? 
You have a great future as a driver. If they don't arrest you first!!
So what'd they say?
He won't be convinced, Salvatore. He has other plans for me.
It's the first time I've had to chance to tell the story. I never mentioned it to anybody.
Oh, how I looked for you, Elena! You'll never know. I wrote, telephoned, nothing. Nobody ever answered. But I dreamt of you for years! That's why I went away...and never came back here.  Even as the years passed, in all the women I met, I was only looking for you. I had success it's true, but there was always something missing...  I'd never have imagined that all this had to end because of the man who was like a father to me. A crazy lunatic! 
I've been looking for you all day. Did you buy the milk?
Don Ciccio, I've got an idea...You remember that old abandoned movie house where they're supposed to build those low-rent houses?
Mr. Bernstein, Mr. Thatcher -
Mr. Kane -
I've just made a shocking discovery. The "Enquirer" is without a telephone. Have two installed at once!
Say, with them fellows -  - it's no trick to get circulation.
Go in and ask him to hurry.
Who's a busy man?  Me?  I'm Chairman of the Board.  I got nothing but time ...  What do you want to know?
That Rosebud?  Maybe some girl?  There were a lot of them back in the early days, and -
Thatcher!  That man was the biggest darn fool I ever met -
The way things turned out, I don't need to tell you - Miss Emily Norton was no rosebud!
It ended -  Then there was Susie - that ended, too.  I guess he didn't make her very happy -  You know, I was thinking - that Rosebud you're trying to find out about -
You don't say!  Why I had no idea -
I'm not guaranteeing a thing, Mr. Bernstein.  You people work too fast for me!  Talk about new brooms!
Do we stand for the same things that the "Chronicle" stands for, Mr. Bernstein?
What's happened?
Mr. Kane, this is a surprise!
We haven't heard from him.
How do you do?  I came here - and I made Mr. Kane come with me...  because I recieved this note -
Hello, Brad -
Here I am, darling...  Darling!... Darling, it's all right...  Mother's here.
There's only one person in the world to decide what I'm going to do - and that's me.  And if you think - if any of you think -
Ow!
What's funny now?
Oh!
Thanks.
A chicken?
A rooster?
That's a ripe old age -  What do you do?
Yes, I would.  That's why I asked.
Don't tell me your toothache is bothering you again?
Charlie!  I said, what time is it?
Hurray for the bulldog!  Half past eleven!  The shows have just let out.  People are going to night clubs and restaurants.  Of course, we're different.  We live in a palace - at the end of the world.
I mean it.  Oh, I know I always say I mean it, and then I don't - or you get me so I don't do what I say I'm going to - but -
Don't you realize that everybody here is going to know about this? That you've packed your bags and ordered the car and -
You're making a bigger fool of yourself than I thought you would, Mr. Kane.  You're licked.  Why don't you -
You're the greatest fool I've ever known, Kane.  If it was anybody else, I'd say what's going to happen to you would be a lesson to you.  Only you're going to need more than one lesson. And you're going to get more than one lesson. 
I know the facts, Mr. Kane.  And I happen to have the incredible insolence to differ with you as to what they mean.  You're a man of great talents, Mr. Kane.
Mr. Kane, how can I persuade you -
You goin', Mom?
Is that really your idea of how to run a newspaper?
You see!  There hasn't been a true word -
Mr. Thatcher, isn't everything I've been saying in the Enquirer about the traction trust absolutely true?
Close the door, Raymond.
I've changed the front page a little, Mr. Bernstein.  That's not enough - There's something I've got to get into this paper besides pictures and print -  I've got to make the "New York Enquirer" as important to New York as the gas in that light.
The "Chronicle" is a good newspaper.
Well, gentlemen, are we going to war?
Say, Brad.  I've got an idea.
Yes?
What do you mean by that?
I said treason was a capital offense punishable by death -
They're true!  Everything I said! Witholding that veto was treason!
There are the people of the United States, and they are blaming you - Oh, I know it doesn't make any sense, but at least you can learn a lesson from it.
Yes.  Now, will you let me go to Chicago?
You still want to be transferred to the other paper?
Mr. Thatcher is going to take you on a trip with him tonight, Charles. You'll be leaving on Number Ten.
David, Grobleski & Davis -  My dear Rawlston - 
Oh, yes.  I know about Mr. Rawlston.
Well, that's about all there is - and I'm getting chills.  Hey, nurse!  Five years ago, he wrote from that place of his down South -  - you know.  Shangri-la?  El Dorado?  Sloppy Joe's?  What's the name of that place?  You know...  All right. Xanadu.  I knew what it was all the time.  You caught on, didn't you?
Anything and everything - he was a regular crow.
I'll get to it right away, Mr. Rawlston.
Yes and no.
Who told you you could sit down here?
I didn't get a thing.  Just the music lessons.  That's all there was to it.
What's this?
Beats me.
Like I'm responsible for all the smokers!
She said not to come home until graduation.
You can hold me down.
You might be let down. I'm not a hermaphrodite.
Why aren't there any lights?
My God. I haven't seen you since... 
Then my mother called me this morning and told me the announcement was in the paper. That's when I hopped the train to come back here, because I knew you'd be a wreck.
No, I wasn't. Not really. I told you'd I'd been seeing other people.
Stop it. He's a nice guy.
It's just the shock of seeing me after three years. Believe me, you'll get over it.
You work in a market, all right.
You mean, on a date?
You're such an asshole.
Where'd he go?  I'd have thought he'd be at your side, like an obedient lapdog.
Are you open?
Using filthy language in front of the customers... you should both get fired.
Who are you to make assessments?
Well, he missed!
Excuse me, do you have...
I work in a shitty video store. I want to go to a good video store so I can rent a good movie.
Dante, let me grab a Gatorade.
I'm a firm believer in the philosophy of a ruling class, especially since I rule.  Is the Pelican flying?
I hit the lights and she freaks. Turns out she thought I was Brad Michaelson.
Great story, isn't it?
Interesting postscript to that story: Do you know who wound up going with Brad Michaelson in the other dark bedroom?
I'm talking to myself here.
...and she's looking to me for support. And I think that this is leading our relationship to a new level.
What's that?
The Emperor.
You know what else I noticed in Jedi?
Something just never sat right with me the second time they destroyed it. I could never put my finger on it-something just wasn't right.
A construction job of that magnitude would require a helluva lot more manpower than the Imperial army had to offer. I'll bet there were independent contractors working on that thing: plumbers, aluminum siders, roofers.
Why doesn't he just mix and match?
Did you ever notice all the prices end in nine? Damn, that's eerie.
What's a jizz-mopper?
What for? They don't bother me if I don't bother them.
It's not really anyone per se, it's more of separate groupings.
Which ones?
Thirty-seven!
He didn't mention it when he called you this morning?
Look who you're asking here. How're we gonna block off the street?
Helluva game!
Hockey's hockey. At least we got to play.
What happened to all the Gatorade?
How? When?
I'm gonna go to her wake.
What!?
You've gotta watch the store. I have to go to this.
You hate people.
Don't be an asshole. Somebody has to stay with the store.
She was pretty young, hunhh?
I could never reach.
Does anyone ever knock over a casket on purpose?
Her fucking body fell out!
Fine. Just lend me your car.
What's that for?
What?
Please, get the hell out of here.
Hermaphroditic porn. Starlets with both organs. You should see the box: Beautiful women with dicks that put mine to shame.
You're lying.
You're happy to get a fine?
You're a snake.
You want me to bring the VCR over here so we can watch this?
That's all bullshit. You know what the real problem here is?
I'm talking about this thing you have... this inability to improve your situation in life.
Make them change.
Lovely story.
No, really. What did I do that was so wrong?
I'm calling out. Going to hit the hospital-see how Caitlin is. Then try to see Veronica.
I'd say about sixty, seventy-tops.
Do I know you?
Caitlin Bree. Yeah?
You know him?
Oh, I do. You made the same noise when you reached across the counter for my cash. Your muscles are thin and sadly underutilized.
I am not.
What's that mean?
At Food City it's ninety-nine cents, plus tax.
Is she that girl who's down here all the time? She came here today carrying a plate of food.
And what-you were gonna dump her to date that Caitlin chick?
Damn. She sure goes out of her way.
You know the insides of those are filled with stuff that gives you cancer.
Um... yeah, but it's for employees only.
I said go ahead.
The porno mags?
Why did you agree to come in then?
What were you doing up so late?
What were you doing?
Who's fighting? Why are you so defensive?
How do you know they're taking the right amount of change? Or even paying for what they take?
Honesty through paranoia. Why do you smell like shoe polish?
"Be there?"
Oh, you think so?
And I actually date you?
I'm astonished to hear you trivialize my role in our sex life.
Can't we ever have a discussion without that coming up?
Why do you call him that?
Like you said-she snowballed him.
Yeah, right.
You sucked that guy's dick?
I did understand! I understand that you slept with three different guys, and that's all you said.
How many?
HOW MANY?
Well...?
No, but you sucked enough dick!
Really?  You're the best.
The ostrich syndrome: if you don't see it...
You don't know what you want, but I'm not going to sit here anymore holding your hand until you figure it out! I've encouraged you to get out of this fucking dump and go back to school, to take charge of your life and find direction. I even transferred so maybe you would be more inclined to go back to college if I was with you. Everyone said it was a stupid move, but I didn't care because I loved you and wanted to see you pull yourself out of this senseless funk you've been in since that whore dumped you, oh so many years ago. And now you want to go back to her so she can fuck you over some more?
It stings a little.
You open?
Excuse me, but have you been here all day?
Were you working here at about four o'clock?
Oh shit, look who it is. The human vacuum.
No way!
Did he say "making fuck?"
Let me ask you a question: Do you think this guy's out of shape?
It's probably from being around all this food every day.
Sure. How about the beach?
Till ten. Then I'm going to John K's party.
I... I don't know what to say.
I have first dibs.
Says me. I've been here for half an hour. I'd call that first dibs.
No, I transferred into Monmouth this year. I was tired of missing him. 
I just talked to her on Monday. We still hang out on weekends.
Gabe!  Hey, man!  Gabe!  It's Gabe!
Next time you're like watching MTV, y' know, like flip it to the weather channel for a split second and check it out.  I mean, hey, we could be home watching some righteous pornos.
Answer the man.
Hal's signalling he's OK.
If I don't meet up with them, you can come and pick me up by nightfall.
And it's such a handsome head. Please Frank, and I swear I'll buy one of your paintings.
Jessie, Jessie, copy?
Jessie, Hal, come in...please report.  Over.
A monkey?
I love you, too.
Now let me fill you in.  You can get your ass back down an' go back to that hole you been hiding in--
What the hell do you know about bad time.  You didn't love her, you didn't have to explain to her family.
No, buddy, it was you who dropped it!
Thanks for staying around when you didn't have to.
How's your leg? I'll live.  Where'd you leave Jessie?
Enough.
I know...
Excuse me?
Gabe, did you come back to stay?  You didn't.
And I can't leave.
What if he can't?
They've got to find shelter soon, and so do we.  How are you holding up?
Man, it costs a fortune to heat this place.
I can't believe you just said that.
You still wear the cable necklace I gave you.
Can you think of something more romantic than attacked?
Nice view, huh?
Gabe are you alright?
Frank!  No, Frank!  Frank!
Reach up!  Do it!
Wrap it around that rock twice.
An' if I miss, dig in and try your best to slow the fall.
He'll freeze.
Talk.  No tricks, no codes, no messages.  You haven't found us. It was a fake call.
Travers, you're not running things.
Tucker, you know where the money is-- I want it.
Oh, my God!
Travers!  Hurry it up.
Why?  What are you going to do?!
Where's the third one, Travers?
I don't trust him.
Man against nature, right Travers.
Jessie?  Looks like your friend found company.
This is insane.  The hell with the money.  You radio in for that chopper, understand!
No names, this is an open line!
I'd like to have a word with you. This is Agent Matheson, FBI.
Matheson has been transferred from the Denver office to Frisco. As a professional courtesy between offices, I was asked if he could hitch a ride.
Appreciate it.
I don't like you should do what you done. And I'm not your brother no more and wouldn't want to be.
Yarbles, great bolshy yarblockos to you I'll meet you with chain, or nozh or britva, any time, not having you aiming tolchocks at me reasonless. It stands to reason, I won't have it.
He are here! He have arrived! Hooray!
Been cured, yeah, that was read out to us. The Inspector read all that out to us. He said it was a very good way.
Dear, dear, dear. Whatever happened to you, my boy? Mr. Alexander, now confined to a wheelchair, pushes himself away from his desk, and rolls up to Julian. The water drips off Alex's clothes. They look at each other.
Good evening, sir.
It was very kind of you to leave this out for me, sir. There was no-one around when I finished my bath, so I started. I hope that's alright, sir.
And now you, another victim of the modern age. But you can be helped. I phoned some friends while you were having a bath.
Help you.
Excuse me, missus, can you please help? There's been a terrible accident. Can I please use your telephone for an ambulance?
What would you like to know, sir?
It's past eight, Alex, you don't want to be late for school, son.
Hi. Hi. Hi, there my Pee and Em. All three look up startled.
A big black mark I tell you for every one we don't reclaim. A confession of failure for every one of you who ends up in the stripy hole.
I beg your pardon?
Do you feel that way now?
We got worried. There we were waiting and drinking away at the old knify Moloko and you had not turned up and we thought you might have been like offended by something or other, so around we come to your abode.
And what will you do with the big, big, money? Have you not everything you need? If you need a motor-car, you pluck it from the trees. If you need pretty polly, you take it.
Thank you very much for this chance, sir.
She came towards me with the light like it was the like light of heavenly grace, and the first thing that flashed into my gulliver was that I would like to have her right down there on the floor with the old in-out, real savage. But quick as a shot came the sickness, like a detective that had been watching around the corner and now followed to make his arrest. Alex retching. Minister rises.
Fine, fine.
Oh fine, fi. Keeping out of trouble, you know.
What do I want?
... and that... He pulls Alex's ear, pushes him off balance and plants his foot on his chest.
I'm gonna be sick.
Crime?
Have you ever had any mental illness?
You're absolutely right, sir.
Fine... fine.
It's quite simple really. Were just going to show you some films.
Something like that.
Well, that was a very promising start. By my calculations, you should be starting to feel alright again. Yes? Dr. Brodsky's pleased with you. Now tomorrow there'll be two sessions, of course, morning and afternoon.
Now then, each of these slides needs a reply from one of the people in the picture. You'll tell me what you think the person would say. Alright?
And when do I get out of here then?
Very soon now the drug will cause the subject to experience a death- like paralysis together with deep feelings of terror and helplessness. One of our earlier test subjects described it as being like death, a sense of stifling and drowning, and it is during this period we have found the subject will make his most rewarding associations between his catastrophic experience and environment and the violence he sees. Alex retching violently and struggling against his strait jacket.
You're keen on music?
Can you spare me some cutter, me brother? Can you spare some cutter, me brother? Alex, without looking at him, reaches in his pocket and gives him some money.
If thou lose hope being weary in the days of distress, thy strength shall be diminished.
Instruct thy son and he shall refresh thee and shall give delight to thy soul.
One jacket - blue pinstripe.
I wonder where exactly is it he goes to work of evenings.
Well, it's a surprise all right, a bit bewildering too.
Cram criminals together and what do you get - concentrated criminality... crime in the midst of punishment.
Go ahead, say it.
Could'a fooled me, the way you were hollering into that cell phone.
Keep it.  Go wild.  Have a party.
It's no big deal.
You're an anomaly in today's world, Max.  You're good at what you do, so you must take pride in it...?
No, no way, I couldn't take that...
Thanks for everything, Max.  Wow...
Did you say <u>Dmitri?</u> How do you know about my case?  I don't understand...
...okay, Max, I believe you...I'll get out of the building...
Come on, it's been a long, shitty day. How about a break?  I'll call a tow truck myself, I swear.  I won't budge from this spot.
Remember what you played?
The crowd had to dig it.
One more thing.  If by some chance I get this wrong...tell Dmitri I'm sorry.
Tell me, Vincent.  Do you believe in Santa Claus?
Vincent.  Do not cross me.
...yeah, I'm still at Bellevue.  The John Doe didn't pan out, but you'll never guess who's lying up in the meat locker.
Captain Walt Muldoon, NYPD.
Why didn't you tell me we had company?  And what's your name?
Quite an achievement...
I got caught up at work.
I'm standing right here.
How am I supposed to not get excited, listening to you trying to extort your employee, you sarcastic prick?
He'll keep calling.
Yeah?  So?
...why is everything always about you...
It's home.
You know, this is the cleanest cab I've ever been in.  This your regular ride?
Yeah.  Retirement?  Paid sick leave?
Oh?  How long you been doing this?
He fell on my cab!  From up th-th-there.
No.  You say you're cool.
Uh, look...why don't you just take the car...
Oh.  Oh, no.  You're kidding.  We...
Oh, it's okay, then.  'Cause you're just taking out the garbage...
Please.  Don't do anything.
It was an accident.  You're not liable.  Tell him.
Lenny?  You're an asshole.
God, are you always this prosaic?  You don't learn jazz, it's not something you're <u>taught.</u> It's like breathing, like life.  Like us, tonight, taking what comes and going with the flow.
Damn right.  Instinct, man.  If you think too much, it doesn't work.  Just listen...
Let's go.
Maybe so.  Maybe she hears what you tell her.
He hated everything I did.  Hated me. Got drunk and beat the shit out of me, daily...
Don't be.  I never saw him after I was 15.  Went into the military early.  So all this talk about "my job's temporary, I got big plans," it's all bullshit.
It's what I do for a living.
You're too good.  We're in this together.  Fates intertwined.  Cosmic coincidence and all that crap...
That's the "why."  That's the why? There is no reason.  No good reason; no bad reason.  To live or to die.
'Cause I never got it straightened up; made the push, made the moves...
You're going too fast.
Well.  That was brilliant.
What happened?
They said send you downstairs.
The F.B.I., the C.I.A.  You name the initials and they're down there.
The sound of love.
<u>Jerry</u>?  You didn't show last night.  First time ever.  Had me worried, boy.
Flip.  You're the closest thing I got to a friend around here.  Tell me something.  You think I'm crazy?
I don't see the connection.
I still don't see what it has to do with the President.
You know, to be 'normal' and live in the 'real world,' to swallow Coca cola and eat Kentucky Fried Chicken, you have to be in a conspiracy <u>against yourself</u>.  I can't lie to me, Liza.  And the more I strip through the sham, the crazier I look to people like you. Can't you see that's what they're counting on?  You want to go out sometime?
I won't be here when you get back, but I'll be in touch.  And thanks.
Lucky guess... Um, I'd feel a lot less naked if we could get outta here.
People more serious about their work. You know how to drive this thing or do you just like looking good in it?
Yes.
Nothing scary there.  Sorry.
That's it?
So why are they after you?
So I'm a little jumpy.  Who wouldn't be?
You want something to drink?
Holden Caulfield?  <u>Catcher in the</u> <u>Rye</u>?
Was that who I thought it was?
Has this happened to you before?
Did you see the van back there?
Never mind.  You'd think I was making it up.
You haven't been bothering them, have you?
Elaborate on 'they,' okay?
Sure. One of the richest men in America until he died a few days ago.
It said in the paper he drowned in a swimming pool.  <u>In Newport</u>.
Do you watch the news?  Read the paper.  Last week, this whole place was underwater.
I don't know what to say.  I love you.
I -- It's like, I resolve to call you up 1000 times a day.  To ask you if you'll marry me in some old-fashioned way.  Everything you do is magic.
Oh, Christ, here it comes.  Look, I know you think I'm crazy.  I don't think I am, but...
You look great.
We're going to Queens?
After you.  It's okay.  I'm the one who left it here.
My father's house.
Back where?
Blue moon... Blue moon...
Geronimo is down.
Don't die on me, Jerry.  Okay?
I'm a very patient man.
I like that.  A gun to your head and you ask about your partner. He's okay.  May have a headache for a few days.  Are you here with honorable intentions?
You're here because you figured I might show up.
That's not what I mean.  I want to see her.
I didn't know the C.I.A. had psychiatrists.
A vulgar pop term, but yes.  Take an ordinary man and turn him into an assassin.  That was our goal.
We experimented with hallucinogens.  We used electro- shock to produce a vegetative state.  We conducted terminal experiments in sensory deprivation.
As in 'resulting in death.'  We pushed the envelope until it wasn't even an envelope anymore.
These things you're talking about. You did them to Jerry?
Where'd you get it?
Not a man.  Ezekiel Walters.
It's okay.  I'm game.
Night after that?
Tell him I'm on vacation.  That I won't be back for two weeks.
Dr. Jonas thought you might be inclined not to cooperate.  Why is that?
I've had a lot of credentials flashed in my face, Liza.  What I saw yesterday, I know not to ask questions.  We're out.  Shut off. Terminated.  <u>Understood</u>?
Guy's a C.I.A. shrink.  Here to I.D. Fletcher.  They knew each other somehow.
That's the book Hinkley had on him when he shot Reagan.
Jonas?
When I'm ready to compare notes, I'll let you know.
Who's the Deputy Director of the F.B.I.?
What?
We've lost contact.
... And this is how the extraterrestrial presented himself to you?  As your father?
Mike, because of the Earth's rotation we're only in line with Vega so many hours a day; the only way to get the whole message is to cooperate with other stations.  If Dr. Arroway hadn't moved quickly we could have lost key elements.
I'm sorry, Miss Arroway, not only is it too Speculative a subject for a doctoral dissertation, at this point in your career it'd be tantamount to suicide.
Ellie, I should have done this a long time ago, certainly before I left the N.S.F., but I wanted to give you every benefit of the doubt --
It's not like you've given me much choice.
Then why haven't you detected any signals?  If, as you claim, there have been thousands, millions of advanced civilizations out there for millions of years then why hasn't one signal gotten through?  It'll take a month or two for the paperwork to go through; you're welcome to stay until then.
Mathematics is the only truly universal language, Senator.  We think this may be a beacon -- an announcement to get our attention.
The theological ramifications of all this are obvious; the President feels we need to include religious interests rather than alienate them. She's also named Palmer Joss as their liaison; he's requested a meeting with you.
Apparently he's genuinely interested in science.  This could be a chance to win him over.
I want you to listen to me, carefully.  The minute the implications of this message became clear, this stopped being simply a scientific matter and became a political one -- an extremely complex, extremely volatile one. There are forces at work here you don't understand; I can help you up to a point, but only up to a point.
What is it?  What's happened?
What?
You aren't staying?
Right.  Well.
What does it say?
How can that be?
Dr. Cullers?
Here, right around Centaurus A.
Can't we get rid of them?
I'm saying you might have consulted us; the contents of this message could be extremely sensitive...
Pardon me, but you can't do -- !
Thank you, Doctor.  Now --
Small moves, Captain, small moves.
Could we hear God?
Pensacola.
I used... I used to dream you were alive... and then I'd wake up and lose you all over again.
But you're so... I mean how could you possibly...?  When I was unconscious.  You... downloaded... my thoughts, my memories, even...  This beach.  I've never been here but I remember... it's how I always imagined...  Pensacola.
So who -- what -- are you?
And those other docking ports I saw... I mean... there are others?
So who...?
Am I one... or many?
... all those voices... you gather them all together.  Millions of intelligences in one consciousness... and now we're a part of it.
So.  What happens now?
Eventually you'll get here on your own.  This was just the first step; in time you'll take another.
S.R. Hadden...  You compromised our security codes.
Why am I here, Mr. Hadden?
What kind of deal?
I didn't realize I was out.
If I knew you any better I'd say that doesn't sound like you.
Page after page of data -- over sixty-three thousand in all, if I'm not mistaken... and at the end of each...
The gods sent us the machine because they took pity on us.
I'd say this is slightly different.
You're implying that the whole selection process is a sham?
I read your paper on ETI's.  It's brilliant.
... I'm just so sick of feeling defensive about the things I care about!  Or being lumped in with the lunatic fringe by people like Drumlin, when if they'd just put aside their preconceptions for two seconds and look at the facts...
Please.  Any chance of that died the day David Drumlin was appointed head of the N.S.F.  I have been in contact with a few other SETI people; we've been trying to find backing from private investors. I've even managed to scrounge a couple of hours of telescope time here and there...
If we lived at any previous time in human history we wouldn't even have the option of failing -- we'd have to wonder our whole lives, unable to do anything about it.  This time, right now, is unique in our history, in any civilization's history -- the moment of the acquisition of technology.  The moment when contact becomes possible.  We've already beaten incredible odds by being lucky enough to be alive now.
We could be together again --
Greenbank?
It's good to see you, Ellie.
That you, Valerian?
... What I'm curious about are the wilderness years.  You're out there all alone, no money, mocked by the skeptics.  It must have taken tremendous faith.
I flinched.
Look, I'm a reasonable person, and reasonably intelligent.  But this experience went beyond both.  For the first time I had to consider the possibility that intellect, as wonderful as it is, is not the only way of comprehending the universe. That it was too small and inadequate a tool to deal with what it was faced with.
I thought it was well-written. Heart-felt.  And a little bit naive... But that's just the enemy's perspective.
Ellie... the last time we spoke... I said some things...
During the crusades -- pilgrims who made the journey to the holy land brought back a palm frond to show they'd actually been there.  I thought it sort of made sense that Earth is now your holy land, so...
What?
Ellie, there is no reason you have to be alone.
They don't believe me.
... but it is a good question, and I suppose I'll always wonder about the answer:  Why would they send me back without proof?
In other words, God works in mysterious ways...
I'm not sure...  Maybe it simply exists in the search for it.  Maybe its something we have to make for ourselves.
I don't think you understand. We made a deal ---
You don't take another man's place, boy.
Buck is a deal.
Hot damn, Drag. Tomorrow's Saturday. Another week almost made.
You never thought that's a heavy load?
No. But things ain't always like they seem, Arletta. You know that. A man's gotta go his own way.
You think life is some kind of ocean voyage and you start out with buntin' and hollerin' and high hopes, but the damn ship goes down before you ever reach the other side. Luke?
You allus had good jobs, and that girl in Kentucky I taken a shine to her.
Well, why not? Idee of marryin' got you all choked up, trying to pretend you was respectable you was borin' the hell out of all of us.
Nothin' to do with it. I ain't never give John the kind of feelin' I give you, so I'm payin' him off now. Don't feel you got to say anything. Way it is, sometimes, you just have a feelin' for a child or you don't, and with John I just didn't.
Gotta have kings.
We saw the broads.
Then how come it ain't done yet?
Captain says to wait 'til the Patrol gits here.
Here, Captain.
Cuttin' the heads off parkin' meters, Captain.
In the Navy, we used to call guys --
Borrowin' or payin' back?
Newmeat looks like a poker player, Drag.
Oh, man, did you see her? Did you see her?
He ain't eating beans fer lunch.
Come on, Drag. Lemme take a look.
Maybe he's been chain-ganging too long.
Shut your mouth 'bout my Lucille.
Whatta you mean, forget it?
Where'd the road go?
What did I do? Stole and tole lies. I loved mah neighbor and his wife, but what did I do to deserve this lunatic to come in mah happy home and beat me outa hard earned bread.
'Atsa sign I got me an affectionate nature.
Sure do... that's why we didn't bet with the Navy.
Do we even get our same bunks back?
Koko, write down their names, don't just make marks.
Thirty-nine... forty... forty-one... forty-two...
What's the writing say?
Man! It's gonna be one hot muther today.
Cuter again.
Back a buck.
Yeah, found one in this supermarket, keys in the ignition.
Koko, why don't you let one of these Newmeats take your broom for today?
You can't switch 'round jobs, anyway. I figured he knew that.
You think you've been working hard. This muther'll break your back.
Excuse me, but would you mind explaining why you're watching the lady upstairs?
I hate this...
It's good medicine.
Where were you?  Don't tell me. It's just under seventy, right?  The sun is strong but the air is dry and fresh...
I had the dream again.  And I got another call.  This time he spoke.  He said "You and me, you and me."
He was lying.
He took pains to hide his actions because he knew they were morally wrong.  He was not acting on mad impulse.  He was sane and acting out a pattern he carefully followed every time.
He told me he had done two others just like it.
No, that's still in my jacket I was wearing.  We were supposed to meet on the docks, that number 47 wharf, 10 o'clock Friday.  He's gonna hand me 500 bucks.
Where is it?
Daryll Lee Cullum, he wrote that book, he wanted the lady to have it.  They won't let him send it to her, so I'm getting out, he asks me to deliver it in person, he says, put it on her pillow.  It has all about how he tried to kill her.
In jail.
Hi.  It's your worst student, Peter Foley -- how do you grade me now, Doctor?
You like that action?  Didn't that cop on TV look <u>solemn</u>?  The guy in the basement doesn't matter, anyway, just another lonely heart.
You've been perfect.  Don't spoil the symmetry -- you have to have a male cop.
Yes.  I do.  I want it to end now. Let her go.  I'll come -- just let her go.  She's not important.
Do it.  If that's what all this carnage is about, then do it.  Have enough guts to do it.
Who is this?
Well, it's a hell of an apartment you got here.  I'm living one step away from the projects, myself, but I get to go to work every day, wading in blood and guts.  I guess the books you wrote about these sons of bitches paid off pretty good.
The bodies have been carefully arranged... different positions, but somehow the same.  The positions are brutal... yet quite... artful.  It's like... a signature.  He's proud of his accomplishments.  There are early Picassos and late Picassos, but you always recognize the hand.  He wants us to recognize <u>his</u> hand. I've seen this hand before... what are you hiding?
Where are the stockings he strangled them with?
It's <u>anybody</u> connected to author- ity.  They write, they even knock on your door.  They're <u>fans</u>.  It thrills them to flirt with getting caught.
That's amazing.  A whole new book, thought up in a minute.  Very good.  All I know how t do is get up, take a shower, and go to work. Hope, if he does another I'll nail the son of bitch, and they'll spell my name right in the newspaper. Where is Andy going?
Ruben.
Is that it?
He'll get caught.  If he has a plan that'll be what trips him up...
What's that siren?
Ruben's gone to look... It's banged up but it looks like a .44.  It's Son of Sam.  Is it Son of Sam?
The University computer is down for maintenance, but I've been going through my own notes...
I am not going to talk about it. How do you <u>know</u> it was Andy if the head was gone?  Where is the head? Are you looking for it?  Oh, God, why him?  Because of me.  I can't talk about it.  I write about things like this, stuff it all in books and bury it in libraries. This is the first person close to me who's ever died.  And it's because of me.  This monster killed him because I loved him.
How many do you need to sleep. Really sheep?
Don't let go... I can't breathe... I'll die!
They all have one...
You take it, hang on to it, it'll make you feel safer.  Stay put.
How come you're so up on Dr. Hudson?
Okay.
Not what I meant; why <u>me</u>?
Working late.  You're a damn fool.
If this is just the dump site, where did he do the job?  Where did he pick her up?
Quinn will be here any minute.  What are you going to say?
I heard. Good police work.
You're good enough you'll never have to kill anyone.  I joined the cops to save lives, not waste them.
Ruben, my God, I ought to put you on report.
The woman was in shock.  She was totally out on ranks.  I stayed because I didn't want her to wake up alone in a place where she'd just been under attack.  Stop that, you son of a bitch!  The place wasn't secure.  I was doing my goddamn job!  And, for the <u>second time</u>, I slept in her living room.
I tagged the goddamned stocking. It ain't lost.  We're sequestering that evidence.  That's the trap some son of a bitch is going to fall into...
I'm <U>telling</u> you.  Don't you <u>ever</u> address me publicly in that tone. You'll work what and <u>who</u> I tell you to work.
How about I put Nikko on it?
Sergeant?
Don't swear at me because we got problems.  I'm just giving you the news.  I went to a Catholic school; I'll tell you what they teach.  On the knuckles they teach.
I'm checking out anybody who lives like DeSalvo.  Records of arrests for rape, especially by a man wearing green.  Checking out psychiatric hospitals for his personality profile.  Cross check- ing names from arrests for sexual offenses, public fondling.  If they've got a German wife.  We can keep cops working on this kind of junk for years, and this guy's going to hit again, soon.
Oh, maaaaan?!
That was Bundy.  He killed forty of them, identical, long hair, parted in the middle, alike as Barbie dolls.  ...this is hopeless.  Let's try to get time for a police spokesman to appear on college radio and TV hookups and broadcast a warning?
She's in no shape to give her statement tonight...
I just got here myself, Susan.
He's not treating her right...
We were together six years, sir!
I don't want the job.  Don't do that to her.  She's worked too damned hard for it.
Poor darling.  What can I do about Karen? How can I arrange to have her seduce me? She desperately needs a conquest.
There, that's better.
I think he'll be waiting for us at the airport
I don't think we should have come here. I'm surprised the police don't make it more difficult.
Who is that? The announcer. Do I know him?
Oh yes. I thought he was a medical photographer, doing some sort of accident research. He wanted every conceivable detail about our crash.
There's still a patch of blood there on the road. Did you see it?
You're kidding.
What does he want from you?
I'm going to leave now. Do you want a lift?
Do you live here? With Seagrave?
No, I mean a crash with a history. Camus' Facel Vega, or Nathaniel Nest's station wagon, Grace Kelly's Rover 3500. Fix it just enough to get it rolling. Don't clean it, don't touch anything else.
What about the reshaping of the human body by modern technology? I thought that was your project.
What kind of place is this?
Do we have to talk about this?
The medicine's still bothering me. It feels like I have cotton wrapped around my brain.
I couldn't really say anything because of that fraternizing rule.
First you tell me to do what I want to, then you tell me to stop.
But what I really can't believe is that I'm starting to actually miss work.
I thought about calling, but I want to wait until I know when I'll be out.
Oh, wait a minute, now I see where you're going.
Things have been kind of stressful lately.
Everything's ready for tomorrow night--except the artillery.
You're slowing.
What do you think?
I don't think people even noticed. I thought the ceremony was perfect.
Oh, Ruthie, what am I going to do?
How wonderful, darling.  What does that mean for you?
My goodness. A wedding.      My goodness.
Has Paul heard about his promotion?
Don't forget that Paul's a promising young attorney who loves you very much...
Letty, you should be in bed.
I don't know why you feel you have to lie, Letty.
No, 79. Sorry, this makes me nervous.
Yes?   Go right ahead.
What if it's got a pattern?
Stop acting like you're someone special. You're just like the rest of us.
What are you looking to read?
He asked me to marry him.
It was romantic.   He's very romantic.
No.
A daisy for the lady.
What else would you do?
Just checking.
Yeah.
First off, you'll need to go to Target. And, let's see, what should you buy?
You've got to see the kitchen first.
What do you say we go out to dinner to celebrate?
Hey.
Promise?
The store was busy.
Would you mind if we just called it an early night?
I think I should go home.
Aunt Lily is the one who married your father's cousin?
Bye, Uncle Cort.  What's with the lie?
What do you mean not taking your meds?
Silly?   Silly am I?
I love you so much.
Maybe we could just run away to Tahiti and live on the beach.
So, another one bites the dust.
My math program. The Superintendent said he'd fund it.
Yeah?
Are you all right?
I hope it wasn't something I did.
Especially now.
Exactly. It's time to make decisions.
I hope you like it. It's a Marquis cut, 1.5 carats. They had one with emeralds around it, but this was simpler, more classic in its lines.  Letty?
Sure. We'll save the formal announcement for when you're out. I already told your mother. I hope you don't mind.
Whoa. Whoa. Have really loved me? Letty, it's natural to be nervous. But we're going to work through our problems.
It's a doctor, isn't it? That's unethical. I'll have him rung up on malpractice charges so fast his head will spin.
Of all the crazy things. I understood when you dropped out of law school. And during this whole mess, I've tried to be supportive. But, really, Letty, what can you be thinking?
How's work going?    Are you back at school?
Our relationship meant a lot to me, too, Paul. But it's over.  And Michael being in the hospital doesn't really change things.
I've got a deposition that I really need to get cracking on, so if you don't mind...
Believe me, I wish I'd understood what was going on. I've worked really hard to get better.
It's a very nice letter. But I have to go with what's best for the students.
I need someone to work on budget projections.
All tapped out.
Yeah.   I figured I'd be hearing from you.
Okay.   Okay.    I believe you.
A pass.
Witness' can be convinced they made a mistake. Without the murder weapon the D.A. won't have enough to prosecute you.
What the fuck was all that about at the hotel last night? I thought we had a deal?
I thought I would accompany you to the airport to say bon voyage... and tell you that Marcel will be going with you.
Hello?
You sure? I just got a shipment of espresso from Sicily. Special blend. Can't find anything like it in the States.
-- Super what?
They knew who you were when they broke in your house?
What is happening with the world? There was a time no civilian would touch a made man. Now every babbo in the world thinks he can get away with something. What did they take?
You rob an associate of mine... a friend and--
I don't know.
For what?
What kind of business?
Forget the money! We've got bigger problems than the money right now.
Because you're the closest.
Bastaldi's dead. He is fuckin' dead!
Cut his pants up the leg to the groin.
We had a chance to walk out of Zammito's house.
We've got to be careful not to use our real names while we're in here.
All right, knock it off.
Hadley --
No, that would have left me with nothing because all of you would be dead.
Don't bullshit me.
I'm from Belgium.
And, uh, I'm going to have to charge you a commission... kind of like a brokerage fee.
Yeah?
We had a deal before you and your friends became the new poster boys for crime.
I just thought that--
They were all French guys.
Just find them!
But we ain't had nothing to eat all day boss.
The map said to go left.
What about transportation?
No wonder Zammito didn't want us to walk out with this stuff. He's planning on killing Bonanno and taking over the family.
This is bad. This is really fuckin' bad. Am I the only one who sees how bad this is?
Oh, man... this is bullshit!    You can't trust anyone these days.
Going somewhere?
Today's your lucky day, Sami.
C'mon, I look more like Elvis than you do.
We have a problem. Problem isn't the right word. Dilemma. No that really doesn't describe --  Do you know who that is?
It's good.
How's my brother?
No.   It's mine.
Mr. Zammito?
I understand. The person who sent me wishes to help you.
How are we going to do that?
Holy shit.
You're not helping.
The new Beaujolais' come out in France next week. You like wine?
They send us to Zammito's house. The FBI is right across the street watching the whole thing, but they don't move. A crime is going down and they don't move. Why?  Because they were waiting for us to come out so they could arrest us.
You like shoes?
Who's gonna see it there?
Sounds boring.
Who are you waiting for?
Jesus, Frankie, I'm your brother!
I don't want anything. I just wanted to say... that I may have... overreacted a little the other day.
Yeah. I mean, you are my brother and... well I should have found another way of expressing my disappointment. So, I've decided to make it up to you.
For me? What am I going to do with a piece of shit like this?
Okay.    Okay.
Isn't it a bit too late to be out? You've brought me the sword?
Who are you?  Why is the Green Destiny in your possession?
Tell me, who is your master?
Wherever we want.  We'll get rid of anyone in our way.  Even your father.
You think you've been teaching me all these years from the manual? You couldn't even decipher the symbols!
I'm tired now.
It's heavy for such a thin piece of metal!
Exquisite!  You said it belongs to...
It must be exciting to be a fighter, to be totally free!
I've read all about people like you. Roaming wild, beating up anyone who gets in your way!
Here you must be in proper attire.
I'll give them to you.
What do you want?
Never!
The antidote exists.  She taught it to me.  The formula is simple, but it takes time to prepare.  Trust me. As you have helped me, let me help you.
Out here, you always fight for survival.  You have to be part of a gang to stand a chance.  Slowly, your gang becomes your family.  All that Dark Cloud stuff is just to scare people and make my life easier.
Mu Bai...It's been too long.
The Green Destiny Sword?  You're giving it to Sir Te?
I don't understand.  How can you part with it?  It has always been with you.
You did your job well.  But, this girl... I saw her last night.
That's not for her.  She should come to Wudan and become a disciple.
For her, they might make an exception.  If not, I'm afraid she'll become a poisoned dragon.
Save your strength.
Please, Sir Te, what is it?
But the sword could be in his compound.
And you're gonna tell me who.
You buying?
Whatever it is, the answer's no, Eddie.  I'm too busy tonight.
Don't thank me.  Your ass is already in enough trouble for this shit.
You're welcome.
Don't interfere.
Hey, Darla -- before we die of old age, how about it --?
Does she have a name?
You gotta go now, I bet.
I remember him!  Here, Gabriel... here kitty... Gabriel... Is he still yours?
Well, how's your friend?
A year ago.  Halloween.  A man and a woman.  In a loft.  You helped to murder them.
Do you know what you destroyed?
Who gives a fuck!  I'm a businessman.  You gonna do me, then do me and shut you're face!
Sooner or later, my action were destined to bring me a genuine Fury.  And it turned out to be you. At last.  I appreciate your abilities as few mortals can. That's why I desire them.
How the hell did you do that?
What the hell are you?
Having fun yet?  No?  I'll give you a hint.  Remember whatshername?
You need to learn to mind your own business or you'll never get where you think you're going.
Coupla more rings... 24k.
What's this -- a little, ah, bloodstain, right?  Fifty bucks for the box, and I'm doin' you a --
Do you know of spirit assassins? You do know the dead can rise? Properly motivated, of course.
Who is only invulnerable so long as he cares about the dead.  When he begins to care about the living, you'll find his heart can bleed... and I want it to bleed for me.
An unexpected pleasure.
His journal. He sent it to me the day before he died. Everything about you is in it. The blow jobs, the hand jobs, the menages, your bout with bulimia, the affair you had with your guidance counselor and how he gave you... eww. Let's see, then there's your coke problem... You still keep it in your crucifix, don't you? It's all in there.
So what year are you going into?
I must say I found it rather appalling.
Oh really?
You've read The Fountainhead?
Romantic? He rapes her.
You need help.
About what?
You're naked.
How are you today?
You don't even know me.
Alright.  I want you to leave and go back to New York.
No, not at all.
Somerset Maugham.
It's weird. I actually feel good about myself. Can we do this again next week?
I do.
I don't.
No, it doesn't. I'm happy you're being honest with me.
I can't handle it. I can't keep my feelings bottled up like you. Can you honestly tell me that you feel nothing for me? ... Tell me!
Please don't go.
This isn't working out for me anymore.
You don't know how to love.
It's a beautiful home you have here Mrs. Rosemond.
German.
Unbelievable. Some fag, no offense -
What do you mean?
Are you shitting me?
Really. You think you could arrange a little get together with him tonight on my behalf?
I think he's telling the truth Valmont. Greg couldn't write a grocery list let alone a letter.
Those are my letters!
What was that?
I'll call you later and we'll get together and plan your curriculum.
Really? Bulimic headcase.
Haven't you ever practiced with one of your girlfriends?
See that wasn't so bad.
That's so romantic. Have you responded?
Well do you like him?
Cecile if there's one thing I'm great at it's love letters. With my help, he'll be eating out of the palm of your hand. Perhaps we can arrange a little get together for the two of you at my house.
He made you give him a blow job.
What do I do then?
I'm so proud of you. You're becoming a woman.
Excellent.
I look terrible.
Want a blow job?
Jesus. We've been at this for six months.
This isn't a joke. Your parents spend a lot of money to send you here. I'm trying to help you.
No it doesn't. I see right through you.
Good luck, Sebastian.
Hi, mom.
Hey Blaine, did I leave my... holy shit.
Is she with you?
McConnell, I'm gonna out your ass in two seconds if you don't tell me where she is.
One.
Yeah?
It's been going on for a while.  Then he called me a disgrace to our family and that's when he hit me.
Cecile's attending Oakwood in the fall.
B.F.D. What do you plan to do? Fly to Kansas and woo little Dorothy.
You don't stand a chance. Even this is out of your league.
I'll think about it...
You would not believe what--
No.
The plot thickens. It appears that Cecile has fallen for her music teacher.
Not to mention Court Reynolds. Unfortunately, Ronald's moving with the speed of a Special Olympic Bobsledder.
Who are you calling?
Are you really? I mean, we've done some pretty fucked up shit in our time but this... I mean, we're destroying an innocent girl. You do realize that.
Who are you spying on?
A little melodramatic, don't you think.
I know this sounds corny, but whenever I feel temptations of peer pressure, I...  turn to God and he helps me through the problem. Call me an anachronism, but it works.
Not at all. What's wrong?
What about her?
I can't thank you enough.
First of all, maam, I never touched your daughter and second, I would like to think that in these times someone of your status could look beyond racial lines.
It's desperate that I talk to her.
Young man, I already told you she's not here.
Right after we played backgammon.
Yep. Then I fucked your daughter.
Where the hell do you come off hitting women?
Oh, hello.
But it is a part of our lives too --a part of our past, It's a Goya reproduction. Those three cats --  are supposed to be the most beautifully drawn cats in Western art.
That the old actress -- Julia Farren?
Forgive me, but it was superstition ...foolish, childish wishes...that started, all this.
What are saying, darling?
What song, dear?
Mommy --
Did you ever make a wish?
But where did you get it, Amy?
No dear. I don't know them, but I've heard about them.
Irena.
I'd hate her to grow up like that.
Gosh, in my day kids arrived at birthday parties before anybody was ready for them,
Oilie, that's for the children to play with.
All right, Ollie.  Go ahead. Call the Boyds...3000W...see if their darling Donald has left.
I called not only the Boyds but the Irvings.  Neither of them received invitations.
Where did you get it?
It's late, Mommy -- you haven't forgotten my birthday party.
Hello, Amy.
No, darling, I hadn't intended to.
Amy, not that old tree!
Why didn't you run after them?
Now Amy
Daddy!
She's there, just like I said she'd be.
What'd you get for Christmas?
Irena. But who are you?
Not even Daddy...or Mommy?
That's right!
All right, Amy.  Button your sweater, darling. It's turning cold.
Merry Christmas, Irena.  I brought you a present.
Merry Christmas.
May I pet the deer?
It's you...Irena...my friend!
A ring that I can wish on like I wished on the candles?
You just wait until I finish here. I've got to dust these ships for your Dad.
About time for you to come home, Amy.
Little miss, don't you never come here alone. You gave me a fright, you did.
There was a deer on the other side of the fence.
Mustn't look, little miss. Mustn't look.
Probably hit by a car. Hard to see things in the twilight.
He'll let me stay, Mrs. Farren. He'll let me stay.
I brought you a present. Merry Christmas.
Hurry, hurry.
Hurry!
Look at me. Look at me, mother darling. Look into my eyes. What color eyes did Barbara have?
And my hair...what color hair did Barbara have?
There's another promise you must make me. That little girl who comes here...she mustn't ever come to see you again. Promise me you won't see her.
If that child comes here...if I find her trying to steal your love from me...I'll kill her. Yes, I'll kill her:
Good night, mother, good night.
...At the hour of midnight, down the road that goes through Sleepy Hollow, across the bridge, he goes galloping, galloping, always searching, always seeking
Everything all right down there at the school, Mr. Reed?
Amy looks happy — seems almost as if she were playing with another child; like somebody else were running with her and playing.
I know it may seem stupid of me--but it isn't the slap I'm worried about -- it's the reason.
But there was nothing, no one in the garden.
Waiter! She needs more water.
You shouldn't smoke. It'll kill you.
How's the rest of your health?
PMS. What symptoms are you experiencing?
Sounds all stress related. Your teeth may feel sharper if you're grinding them at night. You don't seem hairy to me. Is that all?
Diet and exercise, that's all there is. I'm not a big proponent of the PMS craze, but there's a book my wife mentioned called "The PMS Diet," which may be helpful.
You haven't mentioned dating anyone since Mark and, well you're not a lesbian are you?
He hasn't said one word to me.
My date always pays more attention to you than to me.
It's not about him seeing you in it. It's how you feel. You'll feel sexy in lingerie and it'll show. It's an inner thing.
Where are all the mediums?
I think she broke the skin.
George bit you?
I don't see anything. Maybe just a little.
Hey, did you get contacts?
Did you get smashed or what? You have to eat if you're drinking. And not just those little salads.
At least your PMS is over.
I thought you were going to stop wearing your glasses.
Are those Mark's?
Why didn't you tell me? You said you hadn't seen him for a month.
I don't think I've ever actually liked anyone I've dated before. Peter even likes me without makeup.
Charming Carlton.
Bag means condom now? I can't keep up with the word "bag." It used to be "No, that's not my bag" -- meaning not my thing. But now "my bag" means "my fault."
Geez, I wish I'd get it like that.
Oh no.
Fuck it's the cops. Peter saw me, now I have to let him in.
I tried to kill myself -- earlier. It doesn't work. I think I need silver bullets. So I got depressed and when I'm depressed I clean.
I'm just afraid I'll hurt Peter. I think I love him.
I think George knows.
I do development for TV movies.
You hungry?
So there I was, hanging from the edge of a bridge, when my mom said, "Son, you got into Harvard!" It took three of them to pull me back! Frida keeps eating.
I'd really feel more comfortable paying for my half of the dinner.
You should have gone at the restaurant.
Look what you did!
Frida, you know you're it for me.
It's a matter of life and death.
Come on, I'm your biggest supporter.
I wish I could help but last I saw Gregory was outside my front door.
You busted me.
Being a cop has such a warm effect on people.
You wanna get some coffee?
I've had time to get over it. She was killed by wolves they think.
Cool. I don't get guys who wear boxers. My ex wore boxers. I never got how he could wear khakis and not have his boxers bunch up.
What are they for?
I'm a cop -- I notice everything. That drawer's ajar, that picture's been moved about an inch, the closet wasn't closed when I left...
Everything okay?
No, no... But Mark -- a jealous boyfriend gone mad. Maybe he kills men you date.
But you said the bodies were ripped to pieces?
I just don't know if I should be dating anyone right now.
Except Mark of course.
That's it? Hell my mom chased my dad around with a knife when she had it. She made us call her a different name. She'd say, "You're talking to Betty now" and we'd leave the house for a few days.
Your breasts feel larger.
Yes, your PMS. Frida I can deal with that.
Go away. I might hurt you.
Be careful!
No way can anything be proved. All they have are some wolf hairs. No one believes in werewolves.
I'm going to take a shower.
I think I'm a werewolf.
Dreams about killing usually signify feelings of guilt. You had sex last night and you feel guilty.
So I asked the bartender what "coyote ugly" meant. It's like the "bagger" system. You know, a two- bagger -- someone so ugly that you need two bags -- one bag to put on their head and another one in case it blows off. Or a three-bagger...
I'm supposed to put up with a fuckin' cat I'm allergic to cause your friend's got PMS?
You want her sheets?
I was thinking about becoming a cop myself. Do you take a test or something or just sign up?
Maybe. What about all those hairs they found on his body?
She's got a hidden pitbull. Maybe she hired someone to kill them.
It's like some fucking monster dropped out of the sky and killed these dudes.
So... they're on some cycle. The murders... Gregory... then 28 days later... Carlton.
Did we get those DNA tests back?
Thanks.  Just some pills.
Sell maps?
Really?  And how is his state of mind?
Please, they'll kill me...
What is this place?
Good evening, sir.
Itís extremely important to my investigation...
It seems fine.
I need everything on the Jonathan White case.
Don't know that either.
They didn't have faces.
What now?
They've taken my mind, my memories...
Jesus!  We have to get you to a doctor...
I didn't realise...
No.  I, ah...
What does she say?  The woman.
We are little more than a sum of memories.  From them we reference who we are, where we're going.  Without a past we are nothing.  This is why you are so interesting.
Why?
What are you hiding?
What is it?
I thought it would make more sense. I'm getting the pieces, but when I put it together it feels like... Like you're telling me about somebody else's life...
How much do you usually get paid?
They barely talk anymore.
Holy cow.
Right and don't embellish.
What the hell is this?
That shelter was in this bill.
Lots of shelters were in this bill.
What do you think you're doing?!
... what?
You're fired.
They say it hit both sides of his brain... Even if he makes it he's gonna be a vegetable.
A condition...
Oh, I know. And then when our poor President gets another stroke - - of course much more serious this time - - the newly appointed V.P. becomes the Pres...
Clean.
Okay, let's see... you can have him on Tuesday the 25th...
It's a homeless shelter.
It's gonna be great.  'Caring about his wife.'  'Spending time on her favorite issue...'
When does it break?
What are you gonna do?
Uh-oh...
Oh yeah... Me, too.  You want to get dinner later?
I'm serious, Dave -- you could get in a lot of trouble for something like this.
And who's gonna find out?
Thanks, I wrote it.
Gimme a quarter.
Dave, the budget's a very complicated thing.  Even I don't understand it sometimes.  Now occasionally we have to make some cuts and...
And it's proving quite effective...
Well... to shore up product identification and preserve market share.
You ever think back to how you started.
Well, is that really true? I mean, would you really get killed just to save his life.
Thanks for doing this, Ellen.
I care about the homeless.
You're leaving?
How were you gonna get home?
You sure this goes somewhere?
He said he'll pick it up in a couple of days.
I know. I'm sorry...
What's wrong?
Hi.
I'll bargain with you. How many of you are on the island?
Where are your headquarters, rebel? Tell me or I'll let you hang there forever...FOREVER!
Then why did you come here?
THIS IS A TRAVESTY! CAPTAIN RHODES IS...
There's no place like this place. Warm climate. This facility. Christ, there ain't nothin' like this no-damn-where! Even the Feds knew that. That's why they stored so much o' their shit down here. It's all mine now. All mine. Just let 'em try ta come after us down here, which they will some day...take a likin' ta what all we got an' come after us. They'll hafta get past my army! An army that ain't afraid ta die...ha ha ha...'cause it's awreddy DAID! HA HA HA HA....
That's the man. He's been holed up here ever since the shit hit the fan. Him and his family owned these islands 'round here. They was leasin' this one to the Fed. The whole underneath is dug out. There was missiles here and laboratories and bomb proof housing, nuclear power, all o' that. Now this is Dickerson's....Gasparilla's... private fortress. Him and a bunch o' his cronies from all the best golf courses in Tallahassee...and his private army, of course.
Oh, what did I run into? A bunch o' Jesus nuts? Religiosos? Prayer won't stop a bullet from one of those storm troopers and prayer won't keep one of those monsters from eatin' your liver for lunch.
I can find it myself. I didn't come that far.
What?
What is it?
How long do we have to watch him?
Oh, no. I'm tryin' to get off this island alive. I'll help you all I can but I'm not goin' in there on a suicide mission. What can you hope to accomplish? Some radios maybe? A supply room or two? You'll all be killed and in a few weeks they'll be back to business as usual. That place was built to withstand nuclear attack! What are you gonna do with a half-dozen guns and a few sticks of nitro?
I thought the purpose of decapitation was to...to...
One day a dead man will refuse to return, and that man will be a saint. The first saint of our century. That's a prayer, too. A catechism. Something the priests tell us to believe.
I had an unfortunate little run-in with him today. In fact...you might say that Mr. Tyler is in big trouble with the...authorities.
I want you to leave. Then maybe...
I am not...a guerilla fighter, Toby. I'm not a pioneer. I'm not...I'm not strong that way. I need...
Mary.
Where are you going, Tyler?
Tricks...Jesus...
No relation.  Never heard of him. Sorry.
I'm in as long as we're careful.
Charlie Dalton.
Why doesn't he let you do what you want?
It will?  How do you figure?
Can you believe it?  She was gonna call me!  She invited me to a party with her!
How'd it go?  Did you read it to her?
Oh come on, Cameron, don't you get anything?
Hey guys, why don't you show Tina the Dead Poets garden?
Well...
Well, of course not.  It's just that... You could have warned us.
Oh God, it's over now!
But what if they see it, Nuwanda?
You're siding with Mr. Nolan?!  What about carpe diem and sucking all the marrow out of life and all that?
Yes sir.
I think he's sweet.
Welcome. back, Mr. Dalton.  How's your father?
Hey, I heard you went to summer school?
Hey, he's your roommate.
Todd's brother is Jeffrey Anderson.
Maybe he'll have some advice.  Maybe he'll even talk to your father.
Oh Chet, that feels fabulous,
Don't stop.
Ginny Danburry's here.  Look for her.
Knox, I don't believe this!
Chris!
Knox, you are so infuriating!
Uh-huh.
God, if Chet found out he'd...
What is that?
We thought it would be good to break old habits, sir.
Gather ye rosebuds while ye may.  The Latin term for that sentiment is "Carpe Diem." Anyone know what that means?
Oh Captain, My Captain.  What if we don't know anything about someone like Rahesh Non?
A sweaty-toothed madman
Come on boys, don't be shy.
Gosh, they don't give you much room around here, do they?
Are you kidding?  He'd kill me!
Well, if it's more than a whim, then you'll have to prove that to him.  You'll have to show him with your passion and commitment that it's what you really want to do.  If that doesn't work, at least by then you'll be eighteen and able to do what you want.
Too bad.
You really think I should forget her?
His grades are hurting, Charlie.
If you have built castles in the air, your work need not be lost.  That is where they should be.  Now put foundations under them.
But father, it's not fair.
When you've finished medical school and you're on your own, you can do as you please.  Until then, you will listen to me.
You know what this means to your mother, don't you?
My parents wanted me here all along but my grades weren't good enough.  I had to go to Balincrest to pull them up.
So what do you think of my father?
What?
Put what?  Goddamn it, tell me.
What?
A Midsummer Night's Dream. What is it?
So?
Neil, how are you gonna be in a play if your father won't let you?
Come on, that's impossible.
From you?
Here, villain, draw and ready. where art thou?
Follow me then to plainer ground.  God, I love this!
Lots of girls.  The girl who plays Hermia is incredible.
How do we get out of here?
It's not going to help us!
Right here...middle of nowhere...and the answer to your question is yes.
Where are my men?
Who gives a shit about aft?
Maybe we lost them.
Noooo!
Self sufficient...
Where's you friend?
If I told you once...I told you a thousand times...
Sure I do...I give a shit that at 0300 hour we reach our point of dentination. I give a shit that those mojos got to do what they got to do, and 45 minutes later we are turn around and gone. I give a shit that by the time the sun comes up we are all safely tucked in bed.
Joey...it's okay...
Joey... Which way's aft?
You know what I think? I think our luck has just about run shit out...
I'm telling you, man, we got to give the future some serious thought.
Man, don't go up there...
All you're gonna do is get yourself killed...and for what? Some chick?
I mean...where is everbody?
Someone's back there.
Check it out!
I'm not screwing around with you man...I hate the cold water.
Maybe it's the wrong ship.
She fucked me too.
Fucking women, man...
Here. Here we go.  Here's to you, Nick!
Ammo! Get the ammo!
In case???!!! In case of what? In case you stumble on her, suckin' cock in the front fucking hall?!
Albert! For Christ's sake... John! Wait a minute, you guys!
You gotta hit it here. Here, Albert, not there.
That's new, isn't it?
He's serious. Vince is fuckin' serious!
You're back.
I'm glad. Seriously... I'm very glad.
Oh, sure... Twice a day.
Nick... Sal is very weak. He suffered a severe wound... and right now he doesn't want a whole lot of people to get involved in a whole thing.
I have to go.
Those fuckin' niggers. This time I'm going to eat balls!... You ever try 'em?
Look at that, see... Watch. Wait a minute, watch. There! D'j'u see that? D'j'u see the way he... You know what that guy is doing? That guy is squeezing her ass!
Nick! Hey, Nick!  Boy! Boy oh boy! Are you okay? You're okay, huh?
Kind of. You didn't know?
Biederman! Where's Biederman!
I was just wondering... Nick... You're going hunting... If I could use this place to stay, because...
What?
Fine. I just go along, you know. Down at the market. Back here. I mean it just seems there's a million things to do!... Are you sure you're all right? I mean, what about the wound?
Frost.
Did you get hurt? You didn't get hurt?
Nick?
Linda... Honey, what's wrong?
You seem... disturbed.
Listen to me, Sal. If you don't do it they'll put you in the pit. If they put you in the pit, Sal, you're gonna die... Sal, do you understand?
You should have put that on last night.
What do you think about?
What'd he say?
Pow?
I love this fuckin' place... That sounds crazy. I know that sounds crazy, but I love this fuckin' place... If anything happens, Nick, don't leave me there. I mean it. Don't leave me... You gotta promise, Nick. You gotta promise me that.
I'm telling you, Nick, no one's going to come.
What are you, hoping?
Nick, you're wasting your time... Listen to me! You're wasting your time! This is no fucking time for hoping or praying or wishing or any other shit! This is it. Here we are... And we gotta get out!
Forget Sal.
More bullets in the gun... The trouble is that still leaves one of us with his hands tied up, so that means we gotta play each other.
No.
What's that noise?
Did you go hunting.
Yeah.
Well, who'd you get married to?
How's it feel, huh? How's it feel to be back?
No!
Six or eight.  And they go wild?
Down I would say... What would you say?
No chance.  Not their sector.  They ain't even into things this big. Our zone-boy's performing out of a horror show.  Something else.  Unit nine found a couple cold ones in Hollywood.  One Manny Turner.  Gun runner. Sounds like a connection to me.
This monster escaped from Cryo- Prison this morning.
Michael called yesterday.  He wants to take Willy for the summer.
I think he wants more than your cookies.
It was Wade's old partner... Gallagher. He was behind it all.
Looks like you did more than jackoff while I was gone.
Twenty years have passed, Wade. Lay it to rest.
I told you.  I'm out of the cops and robbers business.  Retired twenty years ago.  I've been trained as a bus driver.  Got a whole route planned and everything.  Even nailed down the lingo - '<u>Exact change, please</u>'.
You're working a partner on this.
Hello Wade.
Tell Frick and Frack that means them too.
I want to stop aging.
Doucet's just offed two of the jurors who put him away.  I'm rounding up the rest of them and putting them in police custody.  What's your status?
Tell Doucet that.  What was his rehabilitation training?
Sir, your dinner with the union leaders begins in an hour.  Your wife will meet you there, so we can leave whenever you're ready.
Got it.  Ejection seat?
I have to go home, Sanchez.
I'll inform dispatch.
NPA metamorphosis should biologically slow him down.  That's when we'll get him.
What's this place?
You need anything else?
Good night, Wade.
I'll have a cup of coffee?
No.  Talk English.  Then I'll understand.
Maybe I should turn myself in.
Let's roll.  We got a guy who swears his car was stolen by a suspect identical to Doucet. 0800 this morning.
Get us some fuck'n back-up now!
Sanchez...?
So, he's got a thing for prison clothes.
No.  I want to be with you.
You never want to find out.
You all right?
I'm going to be a policeman.
Funny.  Would you like to buy me a drink?
What are those people doing there? What do they want?
Belle --
You think you're so smart, Mrs. Stone. You wanted to be near Jabez. It looked like your big chance tonight, but you're wrong, you can't win him back -- not that way.
Grandma, look at me!
Howdy, Jabez.
Don't I? ... Say, that's mighty white of you, Jabez.
Sure does. But I'll have to sleep on it a couple of nights.
Well -- we don't mean to force you, Jabez Stone -- but -- it's only for your own good.
Mornin', Jabez ...
Now run along, Daniel.
What's the matter with you?
You've had a lot of bad luck these days. And yet -- it's all so unnecessary. When I think of your opportunities --
What does it mean here -- about my soul?
No, no! Give it to me!
Excellent. A firm, fair signature. One that will last till doomsday.  My dear Neighbor Stone, I congratulate you! You're going to be the richest man in New Hampshire! 
Good evening, Neighbor Stone.
Are they all as -- small -- as that?
What a headstrong fellow! Well -- I guess you're quite prepared to suffer the consequences.
Are you willing to give me your son in exchange for an extension of our contract?
You know darn well it is.
You win. Will you ride to the village with me, Mr. Stone?
Contracts? -- Yes, they have contracts with me -- lots of 'em -- but -- but that's all right. Without me and my money, they wouldn't have anything.
Coming along, Jabez?
Why -- good morning, Squire.
Worst I had in years -- ahem -- starting a spring cold, I guess -- er -- don't happen to have a bit of camomile tea in the house, do you, Stone?
Well, Jabez -- I'm a little pressed for time. You wanted to discuss something -- some business --
Jabez -- help!
What is that smile on your face?  Is there anything wrong with me?
Your butter money?
Mary, I'm a farmer -- always will be. To me seed isn't a thing to pay debts with, it's alive, more alive than anything -- but I guess you're right. We just got to do it. Oh -- how's it all going to end?
Mary--
I'll get the doctor.
Mary -- what would you do with a pot o' gold?
We must go on home, Jabez.
You'll never change -- will you?
What happened.... Where are you taking him?
Mary! Come back ...
Now, Jabez Stone -- as for what you're calling hard luck -- well, we made New England out of it. That and codfish.
What's ailing that dog?
Hush up such talk, Jabez!
I feel -- fidgety, Ma -- not right at all.
You see, son? I'm old and I've lived. When a man gets his money in bad ways -- when he sees the better course and takes the worse -- then the devil is in his heart -- and that fixes him.
Now that's the way to talk, Son! I know you worked hard for that crop. But we'll make out.
My son ... what's the matter?
Yep -- you can't get around that mortgage. -- I'm sorry, Jabez.
Hello, Sheriff.
You throw mighty far, Jabez -- almost into the pigsty.
Let her be, son. She'll do all right. You better get yourself straightened out.
I've heard some odd things about Jabez lately -- he seems to make the wrong kind of name for himself.
Jabez ...
There is nothing like a good old country breakfast. Where's Ma?
Hey there, Dan'l! Black Dan'l!
Very well. -- You shall have your trial, Mr. Webster. The case is hardly one for an ordinary jury --
No, no ...  I want to talk to men ... to people in Cross Corners ...to my neighbors ...
Argyle.  Don't you take this stuff?
Hey, I'm sorry.  When I was a cabdriver, see, people expected a little chit chat, a little eccentricity and comaraderie, I forgot how stuck up you limo guys were, so excuse me.
She had a good job, it turned into a great career.
Closer to Japan.  You're fast.
You're amazing.  You figured this all out already?
I must have missed 60 Minutes.  What are you saying?
Hans, he killed by brother --
Yes...I know about them.  The code key is a necessary step in accessing the vault.
Bad for your health anyway.
I'm afraid not.  But you have me at a loss -- you know my name, but who are you?  Just another American who saw too many movies as a child.  Another orphan of a bankrupt culture who thinks he's John Wayne...Rambo... Marshal Dillion.
Hear that?  Talk to me, where are my detonators.  Where are they or shall I shoot another one?  Sooner or later...  ...I might get to someone you do care about.
New York...
Better than being caught with your pants down, right?  John McClane.
Hans.  Your Hans.
...the circuits that cannot be cut... are cut automatically in reponse to a terrorist incident...You ask for miracles, Theo...I give you the FBI...
No.  But I'll have a sofa brought out to you.  Good enough?
After all your posturing, all your speeches...you're nothing but a common thief.
What are you doing?
Well, Cappy Roberts retired out here a couple years ago.  He said I could bunk with him.
...I've missed you.						*
Yeah, just trying to handle some year old twinkies.  Yucck.  What do they put in these things?
Al?  Al, you there?
The way you drove that car, I figured you for the streets.
They way you drive, I can see why.
Look...I'm getting a bad feeling up here...I'd like you to do something for me.  Look up my wife...don't ask how, you'll know by then...and tell her...tell her...I've been a jerk. When things panned out for her, I should've been behind her all the way ...We had something great going until I screwed it up...She was the best thing that ever happened to a bum like me.  She's heard me say I love you a thousand times, but she never got to hear this...honey...I'm sorry.  You get all that?
Going in...are you out of your mind? There's 30 hostages in there -- for all we know --
This is --
Gene -- you smilin'?
So whatsa deal?
These seats come out?
God damn it, Sheila isn't gonna believe it.  They just call in and say gas up a stretchout and get it down to  and I say, 'shit, another load of Elks for the massage parlors.'
Hey, Sonny!  I'm watchin' it on TV!
Jenny?
It looks like a whole roast.
I'll kiss the baby for you.
Jesus Christ is coming back and he's really pissed.
Hello.  Hello, Leon.
Well.... huh ...
Yeah...
Fine, thank you.  I'm in trouble. That is... now I am!
I gotta jet coming here and we're gonna try to get the fuck outta this thing.  And we're gonna go, man!
I know!
Huh ... I don't know.  They got Howard Johnson's there.  I don't know why the fuck I'm going there for.
Look... don't throw that on me.
Well, you got to get hold of yourself.  You got to talk to him, tell him to give himself up.
Somebody's got to stop him, Leon.
He needed money?  For the operation for you?
You alone, or you got confederates?
Right -- got ya.  Okay, so there's you -- what's your name?
You're all one way!  I'm bein' reasonable with you; give me somethin' ... Give me one of them, anyway ... Just one ...
Let Sal come out, take a look. What hope you got?  Quit while you're ahead.  All you got is attempted robbery.
What the hell you doin' back there?
What the fuck do you want?
Well, what were you doin' back there?
Is he all right?  Is he all right?
He's totally unstable.  He'll make a mistake.
Hey... let him out!
I must of been outta my mind.
Now, you -- what's your name?
Don't ask me questions.  I got connections.  You find out who I am, you're cold meat.
You see what we're dealing with? They want me to kill all of you!
Are we going to get the ball rolling?
You know ... I like you people ... I really do.
Yeah.
Mister Mulvaney?
You all right?
Thanks again, Sam.
It's up to you ladies.
Did you know he was a homosexual?
You don't smoke ... why do you want to start now.
I used to, but I stopped.
... The bodies out the door.
Well, I stalled him for a while. When it comes the time, then we'll work it out.  Okay?
I want him to think that.
We'd kill ourselves.
Sonny -
I never been up in a plane before.
Okay ... okay ... all right, Sal, it's okay.  I got everything straightened out ... it's gonna be okay.
It's the FBI.  He wants to come in.
Sal?
Why couldn't he talk about that here?
Hey, Sonny - You did it!
First off, get the lights back on and the air conditioning.
Aw, Jesus ... you been doin' us favors all night!
At the airport.  We get on the plane, check it out, and if it's all okay we'll send them out. Except one.
I don't want him.
Okay, who's the head teller here?
Oh, shit!  I gotta have time to think.
Hey, you okay?
My kids ... Kimmy and Jimmy.
Mom - I got it all worked out; it's over.  The best thing is you go home.  Watch it on TV.
For God's sake don't start in on Heidi again ...
What the hell for?  Twenty-five years in the pen?
Did Pop come down?
Robbing a bank.
But I mean, why do you need to steal?  Couldn't you get a job?
You could give up.
What happened to my money, Mr. Williams? <b> INT. CLAREMONT WILLIAMS III BOND AGENCY -- NEXT </b> Claremont sits behind his desk with his phone to his ear.
Who the hell is that?
Jesus Christ! What's that smell?
Yes.
Okay.
Claremont, you're a chubby chaser.
Ms. Harvey... my name is Taryn Miles. I'm a criminal psychologist working for the FBI. I'm here to ask you a few questions.
You then learned where the thieves had hidden the money... and at the instructions of your employer went to retrieve it yourself.
He's a reality television producer. His name is Mark Weiss.
Are you aware that Lateesha Rodriguez has been running a counterfeit driver's license racket?
Do you want know the real reason why I became a bounty hunter?
LOCUS! BABY... I'M HERE!
Everything. It is a ghastly existence.
Cunt.

We didn't sign on for this shit.  Fuck! This shit is intense. I need to call my agent.
This girl is going to be a star. She just tells it like it is.
Just like Billy Ocean says. <i>When the going gets tough...</i>
How you be?
Yo!
I own a brownstone on this block.
I'm gonna leave now.
Every single one of those pictures is somebody Italian.
And I--we--want some Black people up.
I'm down, but for a worthwhile cause.
What da fuck!  Are you deaf?
Buggin' Out, I gotta work here.
No, you the man.
You a dumb-ass simple motherfucker. Where did you read that?
Hold your tongue.  You don't have that much love.
Good morning.
Doctor, this is Da Mayor talkin'.
Do me a favor.  Go to work.
Is this another one of your patented two-hour lunches?
No.
Nice!
Oh, it doesn't, huh!  You got your little 250 dollars a week plus tips...
Jade, you're late.
Tender-headed runs in my family. You tender-headed?

You're raggedy as a roach.  You eat the holes out of donuts.
Let it be broke.

Hey!  What did I say?
Mookie, get offa da phone.
Yeah, do you know 'em?
You're right, a kid is dead, but Mook, this isn't the time.
Doctor, this is Sal talkin'.
Alright.  Alright.  I'll be over there sometime today.
Tina, you are too slick.
I've been working hard, getting paid.
What?
Feels good.
Just coolin'.

Hi.
Oh, yeah. I don't think they do. You're new here, right?
I've been assigned to write an article about you for the school paper. It was either a feature on you or the new four-color ink pens at the student store.
Yeah, well, I'd much rather write an expose or a hard hitting investigative piece, but nothing really ever happens around here. But, I chose you and that's fine.  I'm Jessica Matthews.
Do you thill want to do an arwticle on me, Jethica?
Okay, there's a lot for us to go over, so it may get hard for you.
Why didn't you tell us your boyfriend was Principal Collins?
The name's Walter.
Wow just like Marco Polo.
No thanks, not hungry. Harry Dunne. Why does that name not sound familiar?
Home school? What's that?
No, I just usually eat my lunch on the crapper. Saves time. Out with the old, in with the new.
We're part of a special class taught by the lunch lady, er, I mean Ms. Heller. Maybe you'd like to join us, it doesn't require any walking.
...oh also, we even have a slogan. 'S' and 'P' stands for 'Special People', which is the kind of kids we are. 'A' and 'Z' is for 'Aren't Zeros' because that is less then one, and when you put it all together it spells...
If he heard you talking like that he'd make you walk the plank.  Three, two, one. Now it's your turn, spin.
Your mom made a move on me.
I can't help my heart. And when I'm your dad, you'll have to do as I say.
Don't use that tone with me, young man.
No.
Can he do that?
These are really cold, huh?
There she goes, now wearing nothing but her underwear.
LLOYD, where've you been? I've been waiting forever. I'm so embarrassed.
...cause you said...
Uh oh. Captain Rob's always been my partner.
Well... Uh...maybe... jeez, how can I say this... you and I could...perhaps ...maybe...uh... partner up?
Oh. Sorry. You're right, field trip partner is a big commitment.
It's really not up to you, Harry. But we just want you to feel like you're part of the decision.
She wants me to stay for dinner, I don't know what to say to her.
You have beautiful eyes.
Do you want me to pet your head?
Did you hear what I said? The treasure! Like on your map!
If you have to ask, you don't know.
You certainly did.
Are, too.
No wonder we both struck out with her. Who can compete with the sexual power of the man who occupies the highest office in the land?
You found my treasure? Why didn't you tell me.
I made the polar bear pants.
That makes total sense. The treasure chest was in his office. Which means Principal Collins is a pirate! I'm surprised Captain Rob never mentioned him.
That's what Jessica was talking about!
HARRY, we found the real thing to be thankful for. Screw George Washington!
Beats me. It's Jessica's Dad - she said he's really anal.
Are you wearing a coconut bra?
Poor question. Too wordy. A good question gets right to the point. Example, where's my chest?
My parents are going to wonder where I am.
I'm going to ask you one last time and if I don't get an answer, I don't even want to think about the consequences which would be frightening to say the least. Where's my chest, Jessica?
Well, what have we here? It appears be a tape.
Hey, Turk rescued you from the nerd. You're in!
Where'd that come from? He holds up a giant key chain.
What are you doing?
I'm so close I can feel it.
Well I need to get a job and you're telling me that if I join up - I can really come and go whenever I want?
What? It's nothing, the cast comes off in six weeks.
Well he missed a great pot of stew!
Have you got what I want?
My boy's special, well how about that. I knew you were different.
Obviously.
Ha! Too big to make the turn!
I think you did it.
... and, Principal Collins, you'll be pleased to know that this year Wednesdays are "South of the Border" days. We'll serve a spicy tuna tamale along with a cheese quesadilla.
God, I've missed you.
Times two.
Guess what"s under these coconuts.
Wait a minute, I think I know who stole it.
The Atreides will be leaving Caladan soon, Baron, and I have here your answer from Duke Leto.
We have just folded space from Ix...
Many machines on Ix... new machines.
You must share with us. -- EMPEROR The Atreides house is building a secret army!... using a technique unknown to us... a technique involving sound. The Duke is becoming more popular in the Landsraad... he could threaten me.... I have ordered House Atreides to occupy Arrakis to mine the spice... thus replacing their enemies the Harkonnens.... House Atreides will not refuse because of the tremendous power they think they will gain. Then, at an appointed time Baron Harkonnen will return to Arrakis and launch a sneak attack on House Atreides... I have promised the Baron five legions of my Sardaukar terror troops.
Can you hear me?... If this visit has anything to do with spice... -- The Guild Navigator shudders and swishes quite violently in his tank.
So, this is Leto the Just...
Don't you trust your own eyes.
Perhaps these are the ones Mapes told us of.
I can't maintain any altitude... we'll never reach the safety of rock.  Maybe that small rock.
A million deaths are not enough for Yueh...
Listen to me!... you wanted to know about my dreams... and I've just had a waking dream... do you know why?... -- JESSICA Calm yourself/
Is he....?
He knows.
It's further than I thought... a worm is sure to come....  I'll plant a thumper, that should divert it. -- Paul moves off into the shadows.  Suddenly, Jessica SEES a burst of LIGHTNING illuminate the mountain of rock in the distant and the vast dunes before them.
Man-carved steps.
You've worn a stillsuit before?
Why do they come?
We surprised a band of smugglers.
The Voice again.
Did they try and fail?
I heard you, Dr. Yueh and Gurney coming down the hall.
Yes. Perhaps he would at that.
Greetings.  I am the Count.
Uh, beg to differ.
Eddie, where are we?  We passed that carwash twenty minutes ago.
Excuse me, Mr. Lugosi??
You know, I saw you perform "Dracula."  In Poughkeepsie, in 1938.
Oh, there's my bus.  Shit, where's my transfer?!
Boy, Mr. Lugosi, you must lead such an exciting life.  When is your next picture coming out?
The pure horror, it both repels and attracts them.  Because in their collective unconsciousness, they have the agony of childbirth.  The blood. The blood is horror.
Vampira!  You will come under my spell!  You will be my slave of love.
You're right, Bela.  Now Dracula, <u>that's</u> a part that takes acting.
Those bastards at Universal.  I made so much money for them, and now I can't get the time of day.
No!  <u>Doctor Acula</u>!  You can still wear the cape, have the fangs... but you're a doctor!  Not a count.
Bela, what happened?!
"Dear, you are a woman of super strength and beauty.  A lovely vision of exquisitely beauty -- shit!"  Damn!  Eddie, I'm sorry I can't remember all this.  I'm an old man. It's too long.
Was I wrong to cast Loretta?
Okay!  How do we turn this thing on?
Do you know I turned down "Frankenstein"?
Bela.  I just wanna thank you again for last night.
Why are you here??
Jesus Christ, what an evening.  What happened?
Don't you have any savings?
Oh.  So what is the scene about?
Jesus!  Are you serious?
I've never seen anything like him!
Um, okay... roll camera
What happened?!  Jesus, Connie, what did you do?
What do you think you're doin'?!
H-how'd you know?!
Hey Cris, how'd you know we'd be living on Mars by 1970?  How'd you know it wouldn't be 1975, or even 1980?
I don't understand.
We thought Mr. Lugosi was insured though the Screen Actors Guild.
Dolores, give me your shoes.
Eddie, I don't understand.  Why are <u>you</u> the most qualified director for the Christine Jorgensen Story?
No!  A horror movie star!
It's a damn good role.
He's a <u>bum</u>.
Screen Classics?  Hmm, don't know them.
Oh, "Dr. Acula."  I get it.  I don't like it.
<u>I'm</u> interested in the picture business.  My associates and I wish to produce a series of uplifting religious films, on the Apostles. But unfortunately, we don't have enough money.
Okay -- you know what you do?  You produce a film in a commercially proven genre.  And after it's a hit, you take the profits from <u>that</u>, and make the twelve Apostles' movies.
Could we moovf to table?
I think you're quite handsome.
My friend, you tink Greta is first woman I ever see?  No!  Many duds, before I find her.
What is happening?
And they always want to cast their buddies -- it doesn't even <u>matter</u> if they're right for the part!
Mr. Welles, is it all worth it?
Yeah, well a couple of things have changed.  It ain't gonna be the Christine Jorgensen story no more. Goddamn "Variety" printed the story before I had the rights, and now that bitch is asking for the sky.
What if I told you you could have a star for $1000??
Yeah!  Five pages right before it ends!  The rest of the show is about some schmuck who likes angora sweaters.
<u>Then how's it gonna get in the</u> <u>picture</u>?!
Ed, what was the one thing I asked you to do?  Make it <u>seven reels long</u>. I've got contracts with my exhibitors.  If it ain't over an hour, they won't play it.
Georgie, what's with the stag footage??  You said you were cutting in <u>establishing shots</u>!
Screw you, Wood!  I even sunk more money into different titles: "Transvestite" "He Or She?" "I Led Two Lives"... It DOESN'T MATTER! Nobody wants to see the piece of shit.
Oh, it's you again.
Did you find it boring?
Does this mean you don't like sex with girls?
Ed, this spaghetti sauce is delicious.
I'd seen him in a coffin so many times, I expected him to jump out...
Ed, I'm so happy for you.
I don't understand.  Do you want my autograph?
You want me to show it on my TV program?  Well I got nothing to do with that.  You should call up the station manager at Channel Seven --
I'm really sorry...
Just like I always promised.  Now you're among the immortals.  You're movie stars.
Ed, I got the Lugosi lookalikes outside.
What are you talking about?!  It's the premise of the movie.  It's even the title, for Christ's sake!
I suppose.  It's very expensive.
What are you, an angora wholesaler?
No, no!  I like girls.  So how 'bout Friday?
What if I'm vomiting?
No. Kissing and hugging, okay, but if it's actual sex they have to cut away.
It's your father. Hank. Your mother went to see him and he had a heart attack.
You know, for a tearjerker. The audience falls in love with this loveable old geezer in a wheelchair and then he dies, it's ... They know what they're doing.
So?
What did you study?
Sure.
Yeah?!
Great line.
Where are you going?
Just wait here. She's coming right back out.

Al!
What?
We're the guys who clean up after the parade.
I told you the facts! He abandoned us -- those are the facts.
Both.
She could've been a nurse.
Oh my God. You and Al were - and that's why you threw him out.
If I don't call you "Dad" it' just because... 1 was already a big boy when you came into our lives --  or when I thought you came into our lives --
Eddie...
What?
Don't tell Al. He doesn't know.
Why shouldn't I be in a place like this? I'm a whore!
Right, yeah --
Hi. Is Shari here?
She won't.
Look, if you don't let me out of this... I'11 just... I'11 just sit in my apartment all day. I won't go anywhere, I won't do anything. What kind of show will that be?
Oh! Oh -- okay, now I get it. It's "Star Search." You wanted me here because the camera comes with me.
What does this mean?
How much less?
Yeah...
Oh, the whole family loved him. Of course, they loved the last guy I went out with, and he strung me along for three years and dumped me.
What do you want?!
Me too. I mean I'm going out with Ray and I'm... thinking about you.
Oh -- Sunday is good for me to meet your folks. We get a big family audience on Sundays so it works out.
I have no privacy. Even now! I'm crying and I can't stop and they won't go away. And now it's going to be another month!
Everybody hates me!
Page three of the Post.
I tried to tell you over the phone -- my parents went to Atlantic City.
So my little brother's staying here. I'm sleeping with Rita.
I'm sorry.
Where?
I feel like a criminal or, like we're cheating on someone.
Kinda'.
What do you mean all of a sudden? You've been going with her six months.
Show business.
Why do you do that?
That's right. You don't know. Doors don't fly open for guys like us.
Marcia's living with a singer?
Hello... Shari, hi... Oh no! ... Oh God!
Next thing you know! Why didn't you stop?
Good-bye, brother!
You know what your problem is?
And each contestant gets one of these.  An "I tried to screw a network executive" tee-shirt.
Ray, where do you keep the glasses?
That girl's an idiot.
I'm Jill. I really like your show. I think you're great.
Sign here, please.
You did it at your house?  Your own house?
In love?
But you haven't written your novel.
Sherry   Sherry  Sheerrry. ...
One night he took us editors out to celebrate after a deadline. Eventually Dave and I were left alone and we got to talking - not like teacher and student, but like two adults.
It was the first time somebody ever saw the real me, the me that nobody else knows.
Thank God for Diane.  She was my best friend, my source of love and strength. Oh sure, we'd had our share of bumpy times, but we'd always seen them through.  After nine years of marriage, we were closer than ever.  And the secret? Good communication.
Come on, doit. Doit. Fill me up. Come on, fill me up
All right.  Well, sure nice to meet you.
You're kidding, right?
Larry? We've got twenty-five minutes until the assembly, and we still have to do counts for VP, Treasurer and Secretary. Mr. Hendricks and I have both verified the numbers, and unless you can come up with the ballots you claim are missing -
I got all my signatures.  One hundred and fifty-eight -- way more than I need!
Thanks for everything.
I can't wait to start campaigning.
These are a bunch of burn-outs. And look at this one, I can't even read this one.
A travesty.  Huh.  That's interesting, because I think you did it.
I was.  So?  Mr. Pecharda let me in. As you know, with all my responsibilities I often come in on the weekend and have permission to do so. But I left very early, around 6:30.
Plenty of pep, too.
Well, I... I... that's very nice of you.
Walt will be speaking with you about this, but I need you to find someone to take over my classes. The lesson plans for the rest of the year are in my top right drawer.
So... what do you have to tell me?
Looks at her skeptically  doesn't say a word.
Could you get this? I can't
Yeah.  I'm here.
Who, me?  Nooo.  I never... I don't know anything about that stuff, Mr. M. Besides, that's Tracy Flick's thing. She's always working so hard and --
And she's super-nice
Paul, what's your favorite fruit?
What...?
Yeah.
Can I sign yours too?
You dumbshit!
What do you want?
How's the left these days?
Can I get you a drink?
I was friendly with Sue Lefferts, but we weren't really friends. You know what I mean?
I wondered when you might ring the bell again, Officer White.
It doesn't matter.  All they get is Veronica Lake.  You got the real Lynn Margaret Bracken...  Where'd this come from?
So you saved her.
Do you like being a cop, Bud?
Come in out of the rain, Bud.
Lad, may I have a word with you?
Does that paper say we've been indicted?  Does it say Exley's a hero for squealing me and Stensland off?
Dudley, what do you want?
He helped me out once.  That's all.
They're yours.  Take them.
Four of the defendants recanted their testimony.
You're perplexing to me these days, Wendell.  You're not your old, cruel self anymore.  I need proof that the extracurricular work I had planned for you remains within your grasp.
You know him?
Susie, I told you I didn't approve of that boyfriend.  He was too old for you.  You let him come into this house and be fresh to me.  I went out one day and old Mrs. Jensen next door saw Susan's boyfriend and another man and thought she heard a ruckus.
Maybe.  I don't know.
Don't mind the smell.  I think a rat died behind the wall... My Susie was a good girl!
What happened?
You expecting problems?
It's a suicide note.  Says he killed Jack because Jack had figured out a pornography scam Patchett was running.
You figured this was a set-up? And you showed up anyway?
Officer White.  How about Susan Lefferts?  You know her?
Where's the other guy?  Buzz.
I don't have one.  Lefferts looked beat-up Christmas Eve, but didn't act it.  How come?
No.
You wanna go downtown and discuss this officially?
There's Gardner, Hepburn, Grable, Turner.  Lynn Bracken is my Veronica Lake.  I use girls who look like movie stars.  Sometimes I employ a plastic surgeon.
No, Mr. White.  Pierce Morehouse Patchett.  Now, I sense you're on your best behavior, but that's all I'll give you.  If you persist, I'll meet you with my attorney. Now, would you like Miss Bracken's address?  I doubt she knows anything, but --
Officer White.  I heard you got a hard-on for wife beaters.
Oh, yeah.  That was a long time ago.  Before your day.  The last few years he's been muscle for hire.  But I heard he's disappeared.
Bud White, what brings you down to the basement?
I don't know if you read the papers, but that case is closed.
What do you want to know?
But she's moving away from the door.  Who was sitting at this table?
More or less.
Nothing, Ray.  That Larry, he's a pisser.  You did the Casitas Youth Camp with him, didn't you?
Oh?  you feel that way about people, too?
It's for your own safety.  Now what can you tell us about Sergeant John Vincennes?
Okay.  Okay.  Everyone knows Patchett's worth a boat-load of greenbacks.  From aviation, freeway construction.  But the man has hobbies, too.  He bankrolls B movies under the table and runs movie star look-alike hookers. And try this on:  he's rumored to be a periodic heroin sniffer.  All in all a powerful behind-the- scenes strange-o.
I know you mean well, Dudley, but I don't need to do it the way you did.  Or my father.
Ed, I want confessions.
There are loose ends out there, Dudley.  I --
<u>No</u>.
John, I doubt you've ever drawn a stupid breath.  Don't start now.
You think golden boy can handle it, Cap?
Do you make the three Negroes for the Nite Owl killings?
Is there more to that, or do I have to guess?
Okay, college boy, I'll help you. But I want half the collar.
She is Lana Turner.
How was I?
You're tougher than Bud thinks you are.
Like recognizes like.  I'm pretty tough, myself.
Okay!  You're right!  Dudley's got photos of me and Reynolds.
Let my Susie rest in peace!
A sweet man.
Jack!  It's Christmas!
<u>Hush-Hush</u>.  Off the record and on the Q.T.
You tight with the D.A., trash?
Loew didn't go with him.  You're sure?
Pacific Coast Bell.
Please hold the line... No such number is assigned.
Brill?
DePinto's dead.
What'd he give to you?
Don't bullshit me, I can save your life.
I just gave him my card.
209 to anyone! I need some help here!
They keep taking the bird seed. I thought since you're the expert on--
We've also been informed that the Grand Jury is going to call for an investigation into your affairs.
Why don't you just call Brill directly.
That's who they are.
I don't know what that means.
What if--
What if I find out what they're after. You know these people, I don't.
I didn't use my name.
The NSA's been in bed with the entire tele-communications industry since the 40's. They've infected everything: Banks, computers, phones, mail, name it.  The more technology we buy into, the easier it is keeping tabs on us. It's a brave new world.  At least it better be.
I intercepted phone calls.
Meade has 18 underground acres of computers. They scan <u>every</u> phonecall for target words like "bomb" or "President". We red-flag phone numbers or voice prints...whatever we wanted. When the computers found something, it was bounced to comparative analysis.
The NSA killed him.
They're here.
Empty 'em 'till they're almost flat. And turn your head. There might be some debris flying your way.
You're driving.
Think we let out enough air?
Fuckin-A.
These guys are incredibly persistent.
Drive.
Same thing?
I was thinkin' about asking for my hundred and fifty grand and calling it quits.
What if we transmitted it over cellular?
Nah, they'd shut down the pin number.
We're gonna lead Albert by the nose to one conclusion. And then when he's pissed as hell, we're gonna drop the tape in his lap. How fast can you teach me what I need to know?
Feeling lucky?
FBI, CIA, NSA, local cops.
I yanked this off your RV. It's a Global Positioning Tracker.
Hi, Mr. Dean.
Oh, God, I <u>knew</u> it was stupid, I <u>knew</u> we'd get caught. But the Gameboy was just <u>sitting</u> there. Right on top of the bag. Yes. Yes. We took the GameBoy out of the bag, but with every intention of putting it back.
It's okay. I think it's a wonderful gift.
Very good.
What size?
What size?
For that matter, I think you will too.
Because my life is being ruined.
Yes?
About the accident.
You tell me.
I'm just trying to determine if Mr. Zavitz was involved in something more than a simple bus accident.
Did he give you anything?
Anything at all?
Hey.
So you tap everyone's phone? You use computers to probe financial records? New Search and Seizure laws?
You should take this seriously.
What'd you buy at Harrison's?
How'd you get the information on DePinto?
Have you been working with Rachel?
I don't understand why Jerry couldn't clear this up.
The date stamp on the picture is last <u>month</u>. Is that where you and Rachel conduct business.
It wasn't me.
Maybe it's not connected yet.
Why the hell would I--
You're goddam right you jumped the gun.
I want to talk to a goddam lawyer.
Do you like fish?
"Soon". Or at least sooner than never.
Ten thousand cash. I don't know if it's Brill's prices going up or your commission.
There are reporters wanting to know about my relationship with you and how long I've worked for the mob. The <u>mob</u>, Bobby!
Good. You're just what I need right now.
You being audited?
Rachel--
I've never met him?
This conversation's over.
I don't <u>have</u> a life, Bobby. I'm in love with a married man.
Yeah?
You're wrong.
Otherwise you may have to what?
Well until we find, you're gonna have to take a leave of absence.
Because they've been paid off by Bellmoth.
Robert--
Sure, go ahead.
He's kidding.
Who won the fight?
No.
Why don't you give 'em a call.
I love my blender.
No, but they took my blender.
The Congressman's very happy to have your support, but he's heard that there's an investigation.
I don't know. I mean--
I don't know!
I won't <u>make</u> it to the police. They won't let me get there. You go.
I'm sorry, man.
Bobby? Piece of advice?
Turn yourself in.
No. He said they were doing a credit check. Are you refinancing a loan?
Yeah.
What does that have to do with you?
Who?
He's arrogant and threatening. Voice stress points suggest he's worrying.
We found two sets of latent prints in the rubble of Brill's studio. One was Dean's. The other, we believe, belongs to Brill.
If he's with Lyle it means he's got resources.
Not yet. He's near "M" and 34th. I've got an ELSUR unit on the scene now. A residential building. Twelve units.
No thank you.
You felt obliged to.
This is an incredible story - about a man hunting an Ostrich, he's been telling me about Zerzura, he thinks he's been there, but his map, the route he's describing, he couldn't survive the journey now, but he's a poet, so his map is poetry - and now we're onto an Ostrich.  I'm telling her your map is poetry. The Arab shrugs.
Be careful?  You mean you - or me? Who?
They're so untidy.  I'm just trying to rearrange them.
Could I ask you, please, to paste you paintings into my book?  I should like to have them.  I should be honored.
Geoffrey's not in Cairo.  He's not actually a buffoon.  And the plane wasn't a wedding present. It belongs to the British Government.  They want aerial maps of the whole North Africa. So I think he's in Ethiopia.  In case you were counting on his sudden appearance.
Don't.
You sew very badly.
This is - what is this?
Arabic?
This - what's it called? - this place, I love it - this is mine!  I'm asking the King permission to call it the Almasy Bosphorous.
I just know - any minute he'll find out, we'll barge into somebody we'll - and it will ill him.
Katharine!  Oh dear God, Katharine - what are you doing here?
Please don't move me.  It hurts too much.
It hurts too much.
Why did you hate me?
Don't you know you drove everybody mad?
Oh dear.
Safe journey.
Oops!  Mustn't say International. Dirty word.  Filthy word.  His Majesty! Die Führer!  Il Duce.
Yes, of course.  So, golly, where have you come from?
What did you think you were doing in his tent?
What did you do?
I'll be back as quick as I can. Thirty-six hours at the outside.
And I'm telling you there's nothing there to explore.
Why do they care about our maps?
May God make safety your companion.
Hey!  Hey!  Stop this jeep!  Let me out of here - there's a woman dying, there's a woman dying while I'm - Hey!
Petty thief, six months imprisonment Kingston Penitentiary, 1937.
It is you.  This was taken in Cairo at British Headquarters - July 41. And so was this - August 41.  And this -February 42.
Yeah, for a while.
No.
Supper. Hana calls after him.
What do you do?  What are you doing here?
You have to protect yourself from sadness.  This is the thing I've learned.  You're in love with him, aren't you? Your patient.  Do you think he's a saint or something?  Because of the way he looks?  I don't think he is.
Have a drink.
So, I come across the Hospital Convoy  I was looking for this stuff, and some nurse, Mary, Hana's friend, tells me about you and Hana, hiding in a monastery, in purdah, whatever it is - retreat -  how you'd come in from the Desert and you were burned and you didn't know your name but you knew the words to every song there was and you had one possession -  - a copy of Herodotus - and it was full of letters and cuttings, and then I knew it must be you.
Before you went over to the Germans, before you got Rommel's spy across the desert and inside British headquarters. He took some pretty good photographs - I saw mine in that torture room in Tobruk, so they made an impression.
You were the only man who knew the desert well enough, the only man who would cross seventeen hundred miles of nothing.
What did you say?
I was just saying, I'm going to cable Downing Street, see if I can't stir up a few shillings - Katharine's mother and the PM's wife are best -
I do so love you.  What do you smell of?
Of course.  Well, we should all go out onto the terrace.
Did Katharine say? - Geoffrey has to fly back to Cairo.
He needn't disturb you.
Excuse me -
Tell me about this, this is in your handwriting - December 22nd - Betrayals in war are childlike compared with our betrayals during peace.  New lovers are nervous and tender, but smash everything - for the heart is an organ of fire…  I love that, I believe that.  Who is K?
I'll probably marry him.
You like him, don't you?  Your voice changes.
I'm still here.
Why don't you go?  You should sleep.
Where's your Stuart from? Somewhere near there, isn't it?
Excuse me.  Yes?  I don't have the key to that door.
No, but, no, not at all.  I'm sorry. You came to the doors, that's all and -  - such good manners for someone worried about mines.  That's all.
For my hair?
I mean home.  India.
I've clung to you.  I've clung to you. Kip.  Life  a raft.
I'll always go back to that church. Look at my painting.
Only we have to go to work.
Whoa - give me a chance!
What's happening?  Am I needed?
This is wonderful!
They're excited!  They're happy about destroying a whole city. Would they do that to a White Man's City?  Never!
Am I being interrogated?  You should be trying to trick me.  Ask me about Tottenham Hotspur.  Or Buckingham Palace. About Marmite - I was addicted.  Or make me speak German, which I can, by the way.
You tell me.  I remember a lot of things. I remember a garden, plunging down to the sea - the Devil's Chimney we called it - and there was a cottage at the bottom, right on the shore, nothing between you and France.
I don't recall authorizing you to have a personal life.
The windows don't open.
You ordering chop suey again?
We've got to catch him in the act.
I've been following this guy for years. I'm your best shot.
That's doable.
I don't want to waste your time.
You have a car?
Like I would have art in my suitcase.
You're not taking me seriously.
I didn't expect you to be so...
I know.
We going somewhere?
You want me to pick up a painting?
He says they turned the card down.
What the hell do I do now?
Those are my clothes.
What's my problem? You want a list?
You don't have any idea how lucky you are!
Someone was expecting that.
I'll need that.
Don't worry, I can get rid of this. No trace. And I'll even go fifty fifty, we're partners aren't we?
So you're testing <u>me</u> now?
Why don't we take oxygen?
Won't take any time.
You're nervous again.
Aren't we all.
And--
Popup, on floorboards. And--
Be careful not to break the laser beams.
Your share.
Hmmm...44 long.
Do you know what you've done!? Do you know?
Currency data so we can do optimum conversions at the moment of transfer.
So how long till we do this?
There's always a surprise.
For God's sake, the only way I can get from one elevator to the other is to jump.
Of course not. It was just a negotiating ploy.
I'm going to disappear. I die in a car crash in Taiwan. Very easy to do.
Don't panic, now, there's no rush...
Hang on.
I cannot get rid of you.
What's wrong.
--You're a cop.
Always in a rush.
Gin, really.
The porta power...comm kits...got the IR/Thermo camera?
The key to success is using the right tools.
If we don't bypass it, the temperature in the Mask room will change and set off the alarm. That would be inconvenient.
We might not want to cash in our chips just yet. She has another job after this one. A big one.
She's calling the shots now.
The face decays, the mask doesn't. Art lasts, we don't. That's why art's so valuable. It's a little piece of immortality.
My friend, you always surprise me.
Where've you been?
What about in terms of medical expenses? 250,000 doesn't come close to what this family's gonna have to spend on doctors.
Tequila.  From your drug dealer friend.
What the hell is this doing here?
Meningitis?  What the hell is meningitis?
This is a real nice place you got here.
An on-site monitoring well?  That means --
It's a good day.  I feel good.
I don't even know how much money that is.
I can put them in a good school.
Open and shut?  <u>Open and fucking shut</u>?
Oh, please, it was long over by then.  God damn, he made me look like some cheap --
You never called me back.  I left messages.
How come you're not at lunch with the girls? You're a girl.
Erin, you've been gone for a week.
Okay, enough --  Now, look, Erin -- this incident aside, I don't think this is the right place for you. So what I'm gonna do is make a few calls on your behalf.  Find you something else, okay?
What are you doing here?
So what's the story on this thing?  This cancer stuff?
So what made you think it was?
I'm telling you, the minute Brenda sent the fax -- I'm talking the second she pressed that send button -- PG&E claims department is on the phone to me, scheduling a meeting.
And you can't?
Bullshit.
We can get these people.  With a little effort, I really think we can nail their asses to the wall.
How many families we talking about here?
You think there's more?
Don't give me that.  You're gonna get plenty rich off of this, Mr. 40 percent.  We got those PG&E fuckers by the balls here.
What do you mean?
Oh, they knew.  They had to know.
I like this case.
Hey.  A new plaintiff called, wants to meet you.  I told him we'd be out there Thursday.
So what are you thinking?
... but it won't cover Annabelle Daniels's medical bills.
What's a demur?
She insulted me!
If you tell me to relax, I'm gonna kick your fucking head off --
Look, this is serious now.  They're talking serious money --
When?  Where?
I did.  Both.
Ed, I swear, I'm not --
When'd they file the demur?
How many counts?
Mommy, can I get a flower?
I hate it too.  I hate this trip.
You've been reading for hours.
I never forget, honey.  I try, real hard. It's just, for some reason, I don't seem to be able to organize things right and -- when it comes to you guys, I end up falling short.
Hey -- those are my files --
You want my number?
I'm not gonna leave my kids with you.
You are someone.
George, I am just trying to do something nice for my kids on my one day off.  Could you please not give me a hard time about it?
Look, don't take this the wrong way, but don't you think you might be out of your league here?
You mind telling me what that's supposed to mean?
No, no jokes, I gotta pee.  Just tell me about your day.  What went on back there?
I'm just saying -- we have one night to ourselves, why do we have to spend it here?
Fuck you.  Just cause I don't spend all day trying to prove what hot shit I am --
They said that'd be tomorrow.  They just wanna keep an eye on me another night.
Hello?
And I miss you.
What time is it?
What?
When Donna told us about you, and what you told her about the chromium, we figured that might have something to do with this, too.
I know.  It's an awful lot.
Wow, that's soon --
Who's Baxter?
Oh.  Oh.
Well, look, there isn't a ton of information here, but from what there is, I'd say that these two people here -- what are their names?  Shanna and Ashley?
Yes, My Lord.
My lord.
Our pursuit ships have sighted the Millennium Falcon, My Lord.  It has entered an asteroid field.
Lord Vader, our ships have completed their scan of the area and found nothing.  The Millennium Falcon definitely went into lightspeed. It's probably on the other side of the galaxy by now.
Will he finish what he begins?
Luke, use The Force only for knowledge and for defense, not as a weapon.  Don't give in to hate or anger or fear ... they lead the way to the dark side ... Luke nods and climbs back into his ship.
Barks at the mention of food. Licks his lips.
Turns on Lando, the newcomer, with an ominous growl.
Barks at Han.
Barks his concern.
... the power?
Okay, Chewie, it's now or never.
Yeah ...
Oh, a Jedi Master.  Different altogether.  Yoda you seek, Yoda.
Look, it smells good.  I'm sure it's delicious   But I don't know why we can't see Yoda now.
Because of my father, I guess.
What is thy bidding, My Master?
Our destruction?  Who?
Whatever it is, it isn't friendly. I'm going to have a look.  Come on, Chewie.
Captain Solo, sir. Might I have a word with you?
I don't know, Artoo.  Sir, might I inquire what's going on?
Transport XJ. get out of here. Go!
What are you so grouchy about?
It sounds like it's trying to get in.
We're doomed.  Goodbye, Mistress Leia.  Goodbye, Captain ...
I can see the edge of the asteroid field, sir.
Yes, Your Highness?
Am I?  I say you came running after me because you were afraid I was leaving you without even a kiss.
There's no accounting for taste. Believe me, you could use a good kiss.  You've spent so much time doing your duty and giving orders you've never learned how to be a woman. It's a shame, because you've got all the makings for one.  I could have helped you plenty in that department ... if you'd have let go for a minute.  But it's too late now, sweetheart.  Your big opportunity is flying out of here.
Spare me please!  Don't tell me about the Rebellion again.  I've had it with your noble mission. All you let yourself think about is the Rebellion.  The result is you're as cold as this planet.
Those creatures he keeps talking about ... we'd better double the security ... Han, I don't know how ...
Why you low-down, stuck-up, half- witted, scruffy-looking nerf-herder.
Would it help if I got out and pushed?
I know, I know, I see them ... LEIA See what?
Let's hope so ... it's just the chance we need.
That Star Destroyer is slowing down.
We've got to get out of this shower.
There, there.  Chewie get a reading on that.  Looks pretty good.
You don't look angry.
Easy, your worship.  Only trying to help.
Those Star Destroyers will spot us long before you can get into light speed.  You can't make the jump in this asteroid field.
That depends.  Where are we?
Lando's not a system, he's a man. A gambler, con-artist ... all- around scoundrel ...  ... your kind of guy.  The system is called Bespin.  It's a ways from here, but reachable.
He found him in a junk pile ...
No thanks.
Loud and clear, kid.  What's up?
That ship saved my life a few times.  It's the fastest hunk of machinery in the galaxy.  What's wrong with her?
Sorry friend, I had no choice. They arrived right before you did.
What about Leia and the Wookiee?
Sorry, am I interrupting anything?
It's a lovely outpost.
What's going on?
Very noble.  Not smart, but noble.
Sure I did ... once.  It turned out lousy.
You'd better know what you're doing, or this is going to get very messy.
What'd you say?
No argument, just do it.  That's a command!
I'm sure my men fixed it.  We've got nothing to worry about.
We've picked up something outside the base in zone one, moving East.
You rest now.
Sir, we've lost the rear deflector shield.  One more direct hit on the back quarter and we're done for.
That's just great.  Why doesn't everyone just take off?
Jabba the Hutt?
I have followed my feelings.
Concentration.  Heh?  Concentration.
What's in there?
I see them! ... They're in pain ... they're suffering.
And sacrifice Han and Leia?
The fear does not reach you.  You have learned more than I anticipated.
All too easy.  Perhaps you are not as strong as The Emperor thought.
Seventeen ships destroyed, we don't know how many got away.
What, Lewis?
Go easy, Stevie.
But he isn't us.  He's your own kind.
L.A. is in a constant state of warfare. Gangs fighting for the right to rule.
His reactor's starting to overheat.
Ooww!
Cuervo...?
I thought he was, but he came back.
All right, so I made another deal.
So what's the deal, gorgeous?
No, that sucks.  How are we getting out?
No. The right skid's broken. If I try to set it down she'll crash. I have to stay in a hoverwhile you jump off.  Hey, Carjack. We gotta hide the girl. Give her your dress.
Shut up, Plissken.
Defense against what?
75% power.
The prototype appears to be armed, Mr. President.  Shall I begin evacuation?
What're you doing in here?
Hi, Snake. It's so great to meet you. My name's Taslima. I'm a fan of yours.
Who?
Don't follow me.
Snake - what is it?
I changed my mind. I'm going with you, wherever you're going.
What are you gonna do in Venice?
Run, Snake...They're coming.
In the name of God, of St. Michael, and St. George, I make you a knight. Rise, Sir...
When you threw it in, what did you see?
Sir, your rage has unbalanced you. It seems you would fight to the death against a knight who is not your enemy, for a length of road you can ride around.
You are still the best knight in Christiandom. You gained a hundred advantages over me. It is I who must love you, for through your courage and patience you taught me a bitter lesson.
Your deeds set an example for all other knights. For your gift, ask a gift of me.
They miss the battlefield. I think we do too.
Hasn't Merlin mended your wound?
My salvation is to die a Knight of the Round Table.
At last...
Who is Merlin?
You saved me from the arrow...
I want to thank you.
Merlin, help me. I need your help. I don't know how--
How? Where?
What?!
I love her. If she would be my queen, my dreams would be answered.
Who will it be? Put your mind to it, then.
Excalibur! Is it true?
The knights of Galys approach the camp. It would be politic...
At your service, sir.
Merlin, tell me. Now that Guenevere is returned to me...
Yes.
What?  The greatest? They blend together like the metals we mix to make a good sword.
With all your powers, you are content to be ridiculed, laughed at...
Father...
I have come to claim what is mine, Father.
The very spear that pierced the side of Christ as he died on the cross.
I cannot offer you the land, only my love...
Who is, then?
And you cannot love me...
I am wasting away and I cannot die. And I cannot live.
Why?
Who?!
Me?
Why didn't he kill us?
The King without his sword, the land without a king...
Just a man. A knight in the King's service.
I have found you. The Queen. An apple. Tomorrow. Sir Gawain...
No, no, of course not. You are young...
A lovestruck page!
They do.
Merlin, the powers of Summoning, the true Name of the charms of Doing and Undoing. Show me!
You provoke me, Merlin.
I am the cloudburst that quenches the flames.
No, he's working on another book.
It must be alright. He's still running around digging up tombs. Besides, he's had experience.
I'm sorry.
And you got an invitation.
Oh circuit my ass, he doesn't give a shit!
What's Burke got to do with it?
This was under Regan's pillow. Did you put it there?
I'm gonna miss you.
Thank you.
Good morning Madame.
Yeah or maybe rats now will you just get those traps.
Very sorry, but you see, no rats!
Excuse me Miss?
How are you today?
Now this is for Ritalin. Ten miligrams a day.
Well, you see, that's quite similar to things like her lying- uncharacter-
Hey, come on, I'm grown-up. What'd she say? I mean specifically, Doctor.
The shaking of the bed, that's doubtless due to musuclar spasms.
So, what causes this?
Look doc, I really don't understand how her whole personality could change.
She's heavily sedated. She'll probably sleep through tomorrow.
You're a friend of Father Dyer, right?
He didn't mention?
On what?
Well before the church approves an exorcism, it conducts an investigation to see if it's warranted. That takes time. In the meantime...
Yes I could, I could see her as a psychiatrist...
No, you don't understand. Your daughter-
Did Regan know a priest was coming over?
Wanna drink.
I told Regan that was holy water, I sprinkled some on her and she reacted very violently. It's tap water.
Well, not while we're in Washington.
Oh look at that.
You know how?
You really don't want me to play huh?
Captain who?
Oh I bet he is.
What are we gonna do on your birthday, isn't that nice it's on a Sunday this year, what can we do?
I love you Rags. We'll have a good day yeah?
Well thank you very much but why on earth would I want to bring Burke on your birthday?
Where'd you ever get an idea like that?
Oh Regan I love your daddy. I'll always love your daddy. Burke just comes around here a lot because he's lonely, don't got nothin' to do.
Oh you did. What did you hear?
Well your thinking's not so good.
What are you doing here?
I don't want it.
Goodbye Father. I call you.
Pathological states can induce abnormal strength, accelerated motor performance. For example, a ninety-pound women sees her child pinned under the wheel of a truck, runs out and lifts the wheels half a foot up off the ground. You know the story, same thing here. Same principle, I mean.
A pneumoencephelogram, I would think, pin down that lesion. It will involve another spinal.
Where'd you get it then?
Think you can sleep?
Goodnight Dims.
You just missed them.
No now.
Quod nomen mihi est?
What's that?
Is that too tight?
Father Karras? Father Karras? Damien? The reponse please Damien!
Amen.
What is it?
Can you give her something?
You this director was doing a film here, Burke Dennings?
Hey, Father? You like movies?
Stick your cock up her ass! You mother fucking, worthless cocksucker!
...in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ!!! It is he who commands you! He who flung you from the heights of Heaven to the depths of hell!
We want to see Mrs. Karras.
Is there someone inside you?
Who is it?
Now?  Why not tomorrow?  After the show.
Beasley.
What's our friend's problem?
They gotta go.
Start him out on cottage cheese. If you've got him on kibble, just soak it a few minutes.  Go down like pudding through a hot pipe.
Piano.
Come on, friend.  I can smell it on you. Get yourself a cup of coffee.  You'll forget what you're angry about.
Uh, Ma, you know, no one calls him that anymore. Jack. He goes by Jack.
Twenty years, Ma ...
I thought these were lost. Where did you find ...
Tag 'em, Willie.  The Regency downtown, Thursday-Friday.  Thanks.
Jack.
Don't make trouble, all right?
Count it.
Listen ... why don't you come out to the house this weekend.  Say hello to the kids. They've grown.
By the way, we gotta go see Ma tomorrow.
What's with Charlie?
Charlie paid you off last night, didn't he?
No?
Look, can we forget last night? We gotta talk.
Jack.
You're getting cold feet about this.
I suppose we can bring it down a little.
Get out of here.
Get out of here!
See anything?
Make it collect.
You all right?
November.  '71.
You leaving that on?
So you're gonna leave it on. Every night.  For a week.
Why would I mind?
Jack ... Jack ... You're acting like a kid.
Thank you, thank you.  You know, Susie and Jack and I only just arrived here yesterday, but already the people here at the King Corporation's Moorish Manor have made us feel, well, a part of the family. And it's their hope that, before you leave, everyone of you will feel a part of that family also.  So, if during-the next few days, we should happen to pass one another in the hallway or in the lobby or wherever ... don't be a stranger. Stop.  Say hello.  Introduce yourself.  Because here, there are no strangers, only friends. And family.  Right, Jack?
What's the matter with you?
What the hell are you doing?
How long you been at it?
They stopped serving two hours ago.
Yeah, well, she's our girl now.  I think we better keep an eye on her.  There's trouble there.  Hey, listen to this.  Ethel and Bert Lane. Married seventy-five years.  You believe that?
Funny, huh?
He's with the hotel.  I called him.
The party's over.
It was like you'd passed some test, you know?
I could've.  But he didn't want me to.
What?
What do you mean?
Cancel, Frank.
Nothing. We get nothing.
What?
Jack, you're on television.
What-are you?  A fucking moron? It's three o'clock in the morning, Frank.  Who's watching?  Your wife? Maybe you can get us a gig playing Little Frank's birthday party. What do you think?
I didn't hear you come in.
Uh, we already boxed some things.  I figured you'd want to go through Dad's stuff.  It's in there. If you want to get started.
Yeah, fine.
Go ahead.
Bought it on the way over.  Clean as a nun.
You know, that night, I ... It just all came up.
Your limo's ready, Ma.
So she's got a few sniffles.
Actually, that's my stage name.
No romance, right?  That's why I came up with Monica. It's what I prefer.
But if you call my house and my mother answers, ask for Blanche.  If you ask for Monica, she'll think you have the wrong number and hang up.
And if she asks what it's about, don't tell her. She's opposed to my career.
This where the auditions are?
What do you mean?
This is show business?
I don't believe it.  I come all the way down down here, break a heel, and you're not gonna give me a chance because I have gum on my lip and I'm a few minutes late.
So if I'm so 'late how come you're still here?
I'm sorry to interrupt, but when I saw you sitting here, I just had to come over.  Florence Simmons.
We'll talk about it later.  Right now, you gotta get changed.
Hey, pal.  I don't know about you, but where I come from there's a little girl's room and a little boy's room and the little boys don't go where the little girls go.
Nine.
Nine!
They're tight.
Oh, thanks.
Right.
The switch.  Hit the switch.
Fucking.  She says fucking in front of an entire room of people.
By the way, I got a messsage yesterday from some guy looking for New Year's action.  Resort, upstate.
You play all these places?
Jesus, you fellas've made a lot of noise.  What's with the stars?
Hey, we're connected.
You're kidding me.
What's with you two?
Is that important?
Uh ... You don't know when you'll be wanting us back, do you, Lloyd?
Yes, sir.  That's quite a girl you boys latched onto.  She a local?
Lucky for you.  Well, there you go, guys. Don't spend it all in one place. Oh ... you want to count it, Jack?
No.
Right.  Bring him back.
All right.  Hold on.
No.
He mentioned you had a girl for a while.  A singer.
Uh-uh.  I never touch American cigarettes.  What's tomorrow again?
Nice place.  Fulla velvet.  Even the bedspreads.  Damn!  Two-fifty a pack and I go through 'em like toothpicks. Twelve-and-a-half cents a piece, you believe that?
Forget it.
Aren't the kids asleep?
What's that supposed to mean?
She's four feet tall.  Ed?
Yeah, well, like I said, it didn't figure.  You two.
How do you know?
So. How are you?
You mean if I get sick?
I'm complimenting you. Can't you ever just say "thanks"?
Uh-oh, somebody's in trouble.
Where am I?
You shouldn't have brought me here ... it's dangerous.
Pollux ...
Oh, God -- Mom OD'd at County General.
Well, you tried.  You failed miserably, but you tried.
We were back in high school. You wanted to join the sky diving team, but I wouldn't let you.
Who is this?
Okay, you're having an emotional crisis.  You need to seek the help of a trained --
Whoever you are, don't call again.
How's Loomis?
Which ear was it?
Now what?
You missed the last three, including her birthday.  Your wife's gripe sheet.
Jon, I'm getting a little annoyed by your obsessive need to spoil my fun.
What're you gonna do with me gone?  You'll drive your wife and kid nuts! I bet your daughter is just about ripe by now. What's her name, Janie?
What are you going to do, Castor?
Stay away from my family!
You'll what?
Archer cut him a deal for turning state's evidence. He's free.
Screw your boundaries, Janie.  You have something I want.
You always call me Miss Brewster.
You've got someone in your office.
What happened?
What is with you tonight?
So -- how long will you be gone this time?
You always say that -- then you leave.
... That's great.
I think Jamie's been seeing Karl again.
I'll deal with her later.
Kate Reynolds was my girlfriend in college.  I almost married her...
Almost married.  And almost a junior broker at E.F. Hutton...
God, no.  I thought about it for practically the entire flight...
No...
Why Jack?
That’s right. And auto supply...
...that’s our war room. We did seven major deals last year, three of them hostile.
Fighting’s a part of it, Annie.  You know that, right?
This isn’t my real life. It’s just a glimpse...
I have winter camp until four, then ballet until five thirty.
One year he had a solar system named after her...
Very nice. What is it?
Is it morning yet?
You see, it’s like we’re in each other’s heads...
She is relentless.
Whoa...whoa...wait a second, Jack.  You’re not actually gonna cheat on Kate?
Look, maybe I’m not as good a consigliere as you are but you have to trust me on this one.  A little flirtation’s harmless but you’re playing with fire here.  The Fidelity Bank and Trust is a tough creditor.  You make a deposit somewhere else, they close your account forever.
C’mon, Evelyn Thompson’s got no class.  She doesn’t marry Dr. Steve, the woman’s living in a trailer.
Look, can I just borrow your car?!  I promise it’ll be returned!
How'd you know my name was Jack?
You know you seem pretty relaxed for a guy who just had a gun pulled on him.
So you're telling me, you've got a gun to your head and you don't think for one second, what if this, what if that, maybe I shouldn't do this, I shoulda done that.
I mean there must be programs out there, opportunities...
You just said everyone needs something.
It’s a glimpse, Jacko.
Do I look like I need your money.  It doesn’t work like that and I can’t tell you why.
You leave now.  Take ticket somewhere else.  Next customer in line...!
I don’t care who you are.  It’s Christmas and like I told you the building is closed.
About four grand.  And a bottle of twenty five year old scotch from Mrs. Johnson in 9D.  I’m putting it all in commercial paper like you said.
Every one of these songs will remind you of me in a slightly different way...
I have a bad feeling about this.
Believe me I know what an incredible opportunity this is for you...
Go. I’m sorry, you should just go...
Are you okay?
Where were you?
Look, we don’t have time for this right now, we’ll talk about it later.  Now get dressed...  You’re not wearing that to the Thompsons’ party. I don’t care how hilarious you think it is...
Why not?
She’s your dog, Jack.
Fine, she’s the kid’s dog.  Let’s go wake Josh, see if he wants to walk her.
Uh...that baby’s crying...
Jack.  I said the kids are asleep...
Hey!  I was watching that!
Shouldn’t we grab some dinner first?  Maybe a bottle of wine...?
I mean...wow...off the charts great.
The trek out to the hospital every day didn’t help either...  You were great. Surviving the heart attack was one thing...
Our life in a nutshell...
I found it at an outlet store.  I know it’s a knock-off, but I think it’ll look great on you...
You really are incredible...
Here’s the thing.  I really hadn’t planned on giving you your...uh... anniversary gift until tonight.  You know, anniversary’s good all day...
Pretty incredible, isn’t it?
You’re talking to their new Vice President of Mergers and Acquisitions.
Jack, what could you possibly be thinking? What about my job?
I can’t believe you want to move back into the city.  I thought the reason we left was because we didn’t want to raise the kids here?
It’s been interesting, that’s for sure.
I need you to remember me, Kate.  How I am right now, right this very moment.  I need you to put that image in your heart and keep it with you, no matter what happens.
What’s going on?
You’re not married, are you?
You can’t go!
Don’t get on that plane!
Don’t do this, Jack... But he continues...
I need you, tiger..
Not by a long shot.
Peter Lassiter...
He certainly has your number, Alan.
For the money, they’re hands down the best radial we carry...
I have to go to my parents' house out in Jersey.  Would you like to come?
Do you want me to look for the box or call the airline?
You didn’t seem to mind offering to help me on Christmas day when you were unwrapping that Prada bag I gave you.
I found it!
Such a sad face... You know, sometimes being different isn't a bad thing.
I'm not really dressed for a party.
Good thing it ain't workin... Reed, what are we doing here?  This guy's fast-food, strip-mall science --
No.  I cannot take orders from that underwear model.  That wingnut washed out of NASA for sneaking two Victoria Secret wannabes into a flight simulator.
They crashed it into a wall.  A flight <i>simulator</i>.
The shields on the station should protect us.
It's about to be a broken face.
We're working as hard as we can --
If you behave, maybe next time daddy'll let you drive.
Please tell me your dawg's not trying to rekindle things with my sister.
Where...where am I?
Reed? ... Sue?
Hey!  That's a <u>prototype</u>!
Way to not overthink it.  So when do we leave?
I don't really know.  A compound organic-metallic alloy.  Stronger than titanium or carbon steel.  Harder than diamonds --
Back it down, Johnny!
I though we went over this.
You're really cramping my style here.
You two need a time-out.
Then what is it?
Reed's disaster.  You know, I half- think he did this to me on purpose.
Get me on the AM shows, Larry King, cover of the Journal...  I've <u>got to</u> do something about this scar.  Make sure they only shoot my right side.
Make sure you find Ben, bring him back here.  And keep it quiet.  I don't need this to hit the press.
But dreams don't pay the bills, do they?  Same old Reed, the hopeless optimist. Still reaching for the stars, with the world on your back.
You back this mission, and I'll sign over a fair percentage of any applications or --
We've got <u>minutes</u> until it hits, not hours...Victor, that storm's <u>deadly</u> -- the radiation's lethal.  We need to abort.
Not until Ben is back inside!
I'm starting to wonder the same thing... How much do you know about what happened to you?
Didn't go as <u>planned</u>?  It was a <u>catastrophe</u>.  You ruined the lives of four people --
Those solar winds are flaring, but I factored them into my coordinates and --
Feeling better?
For science.
Uh, Sue...?  I <u>can't</u>.
How come Ben can't turn it on and off like us?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to do that... You must think that was some kind of latent hostility or --
If we can build a machine to re-create the storm, we can reverse the polarity --
And you sure you can control this thing?  Last time didn't work out so well.
Reed.  How close are we to a cure?
Surprised I agreed to Reed's proposal?
It's been a good two years, Victor... The company's accomplished so much.
What are you doing?
Victor, your scar --
He's working round the clock.  But the data needs to be tested, analyzed before --
Please don't make this personal --
'Scuse me.
At topspeed...and adjusting distance for Degree of Miniaturization --  The sub should get through the Heart in fifty-seven seconds.
<Cardiac Red Alert> we're stopping the Heart.
They're in the Pulmonary Artery.
I told you to cut down on the sugar.
What is it?
Wish I knew why.
You mean <I'm> going along?
Wait a minute! They can't shrink <me>!
Doctor...
Air bubbles!... Doctor --
Cora, is something wrong with the laser?
Bet you're pretty handy around the house... Can you cook?
I'll take some Laughing Gas, ma'am.
Well, it's not exactly a pleasure cruise.
I understand you've been Dr. Duval's Assistant for quite some time... He must've snatched you out of the cradle.
Looks like you didn't batten it down too well.
You must carry spare parts --
You said there was a quick way out!
A what?
That's just dandy. We can't go forward -- and we can't go back.
Tell them to take us out.
You have no right to blame Duval --
Looks like quite a way to go...
I don't believe that.
Sorry we had to get you up at this hour, Mr. Grant.
That's cutting it mighty close -- for a perfect fit.
I've come up against fanatics before, and Duval just doesn't fit the pattern.  I'm going out there, Skipper. Maybe I can be of some help...
Thirty-two minutes left...  But chances are we won't have to wait that long for try-number three.
Doctor -- the channel's getting awful narrow.
The Wall's transparent...
There seems to be something wrong with the Escape Hatch...
...What do you mean, you decided not to park here?
I'm sorry, sir, we do have to charge you the four dollars.
... What is he, deaf?... So, uh, how long have you been with the escort service?
...Come on, man. Okay, here's an idea. We'll stop outside of Brainerd. I know a place there we can get laid. Wuddya think?
You'll take care of it. Boy, you are smooth smooth, you know.
...You c'n'ave my truck. I'm takin' a Shiera.
Huh?
Yah, well, that was a mix-up, then.
What kind of trouble are you in, Jerry?
Well, it's all just part of this - they don't know I need it, see. Okay, so there's that. And even if they did, I wouldn't get it.  So there's that on top, then. See, these're personal matters.
...Blood has been shed.
That's right. And we need more money.
DON'T EVER INTERRUPT ME, JERRY! JUST SHUT THE FUCK UP!
Yah, I got the money, but, uh -
...Yah, well, you stay away from Scotty now -
You called me twenty minutes ago and said you had it! Ready to make delivery, ya says! Come on down and get it!  And here ya are and you're wastin' my time and you're wastin' my wife's time and I'm payin' nineteen- five for this vehicle here!
Well, he never done this before, but seein' as it's special circumstances and all, he says I can knock one hunnert off that TruCoat.
And he says, 'Yah, that guy's dead and I don't mean a old age.' And then he says, 'Geez, I'm goin' crazy out there at the lake.'
So, ya know, he's drinkin', so I don't think a whole great deal of it, but Mrs. Mohra heard about the homicides out here and she thought I should call it in, so I called it in. End a story.
Oh, he was a little guy, kinda funny- lookin'.
Just a general way.
Well, the little guy, he was kinda funny-looking.
You know what a disparity is?
...What's the big deal? It's an hour -
No, see, I don't need a finder's fee, I need - finder's fee's, what, ten percent, heck that's not gonna do it for me. I need the principal.
You wouldn't have an extra ticket there?
It's okay, Scotty. They're not gonna want to hurt her any.  These men, they just want money, see.
Mr. Lundegaard?
Yah, no, I'm kinda - I'm kinda busy -
Yah, so we're all set.
Well, but see, I don't have 'em in front a me - why don't I just fax you over a copy -
Jerry Lundegaard.
Well... yah.
Well, yah, I got an idea. How's that Ciera workin' out for ya?
Yah.
...Dad?
I'm sure sorry. I - Shep told me 8:30. It was a mix-up, I guess.
Stan Grossman called.
Wade, have ya had a chance to think about, uh, that deal I was talkin' about, those forty acres there on Wayzata?
Stan and I're okay.
But we never talked about your fee for bringin' it to us.
Say, ya know those two fellas ya put me in touch with, up there in Fargo?
Well, yah, but he had a buddy there. He, uh -
Geez, you okay, Margie?
Yah, this guy's smaller than his buddy.
How's it look, Marge?
Yah.
Yah?
...Geez.
I'll fix ya some eggs.
...I'll fix ya some eggs.
Heck, it's been such a long time, Mike. It's great to hear from ya.
Geez! You look great!
Oh, yah, a long time ago.
And then I, and then I been workin' for Honeywell for a few years now.
Yah, I, uh... She had leukemia, you know...
...I'm sorry... I shouldn't a done this... I thought we'd have a really terrific time, and now I've...
Nope.
Yah?
Mm. But ya think he's all right? saw him last night and he's -
Oh. Geez.
Copy. And Lundegaard too.
You bet. Thanks for lunch. What do we got here, Arbie's?
Was it reasonable?
They announced it?
Boy, this thing is really... geez.
This is do-able.
That wouldn't interest you.
The first rule of Project --
Look at my face.  I'm a member.  I just need to know if you've seen Tyler Durden.
This was a support group for men with testicular cancer.  The big moosie slobbering all over me was Bob.
Yes.  We're men.  Men is what we are.
And the second rule about it is... you're not supposed to talk about it. And the third rule...
You are?!
You want me to de-prioritize my current reports until you advise of a status upgrade?
I must've left the original in the copy machine.
It becomes an addiction.
You're kidding.
I'll take the parasites.
I want that.
Um... Marla, should we maybe exchange numbers?
How did you find me?
That's the idea -- we split them.
It's for men.
I'm just on my way out...
Except for their humping, Tyler and Marla were never in the same room.
No, thanks.
Where?  Here?
Make sure.
You feel nothing?
No.
He's not here.
Is that what you're calling it?
Marla...
Marla... I need to talk to you.  It's going to take a tremendous act of faith on your part for you to hear me out.
I don't want to hear anything you've got to say.
Marla...
Why are you doing this?
My God, you're shot...
Tyler?
... and you come home to this.
Is this a test, sir?
We have front row seats for this Theater of Mass Destruction.  The Demolitions Committee of Project Mayhem wrapped the foundation columns of ten buildings with blasting gelatin.  In two minutes, primary charges will blow base charges, and those buildings will be reduced to smoldering rubble.  I know this because Tyler knows this.
But maybe, just maybe, you've been delivered.
Well, I have to file a claim...
I don't follow...
They're called "cigarette burns."
Why would anyone want this shitty job?
Why not you?  I'm letting you go first.  Do it.
We've crossed the threshold.  You want to call it off?
The fight.
You?
Hey... don't knock librarians.
Promise you won't.
You get rid of her.
Listen to me.  You have to consider the possibility that God doesn't like you, he never wanted you.  In all probability, He hates you.  This is not the worst thing that can happen...
We don't need him...
What... ?
There's fight club in Delaware City.
Hey.
Where did you go, Psycho-Boy?
Why wasn't I told about "Project Mayhem?"
This does not belong to us.  We are not the leaders.  We are not special.
"Too young?"
People think that you're me, because you and I happen to share the same body.
There!  Happy?  I asked for one thing from you... one simple promise.  Now look what you've done!
What a ridiculous thing to say.
...stop me?
Yes...
Bob was a grown man.  In any great struggle, there will be casualties. Wouldn't that be implicit in the name?  Project "Mayhem."
Ask me nicely.
How'd you do that?!  You're a fucking figment of my imagination... you're psychogenic fugue state...
Why... why... why... ?
From now on, we'll share Marla. We've been spending too much time apart...
What are you doing?
Why do you want to do that? Why do you want to put that gun in your mouth?
Who is this?
Listen, something is going to happen, something terrible...
It's what he would have wanted, sir.
Who told you motherfuckers you could use my place?
What are you doing?!
Okay!  Okay, fuck it!  Use the basement!  Get off me!
Is this a picture of Mom and Dad?
Animals.
Officer Burke pulled me away from the crash that killed my friends.
If you have the same power as Alex, you'll be seeing signs soon.  When you see anything creepy or ominous, an in-your-face irony kinda thing? Don't ignore it.  It usually means the difference between life and death.
I can practically taste the water in my throat.  And something else.  The smell of flowers...
Here we go.  The vehicle's a delivery van registered to Jorge and Isabella Cruz.  And Christ, there's almost a dozen domestic disturbance complaints on these two.
Calm down, Kimmy.  It's not drugs, just weed.
A Trans Am.  That shit went out with New Kids on the Block.
Dano, shouldn't we stop and help your mother?
Take a guess.
THAT's the truck that's going to kill everyone!
Tell me again how it started.
You mean Alex Browning.
I tried calling last night but your father --
I know.  I've gotten calls all morning from everyone who was on the onramp. We're all meeting at my apartment tonight.
I didn't.  Until I was dispatched to clean up one of the Flight 180 survivors.
Turn around.  The cleaning woman said they're at the dentist's. 14th and Main.
It throws the entire Death list out of whack.  And a new list has to be rewritten from scratch.  We all start over with a clean slate.
Shit, I don't have her number.  She was never interviewed.  She took off right after the accident.
Stop it, don't move him!
Welcome back.  We did it.  For real.
This trip better be worth it. What's the guy-girl ratio again?
What is it?  What are you?
What is it?  What are you?
The best way to get to Yankee Stadium is Route 18.
Can I ask you a question?
I'm sorry.  I'm just so happy that you're safe.
There were so many times I didn't think I could last another day.  I can't even tell you some of the things I thought about.
"It?"
Is that something you're "feeling?"
I'm not just layin' down a bunch of math here, with this. I'm talking about indications... omens... that day, that we were meant to die. That, if, we have been aware of... would have saved everyone on the plane.
You know what to do.
You're payin' for my trip, Browning!
We're losing our favorite teacher.
You should have been next. After Lewton, you should've been next. That's the only pattern. You should be dead.
My intervention in the death of 180 survivors will cheat the design.
Man, that is one George Michael notch from being gay.
Fag.
You may not realize it, but we're all just a mouse that a cat has by its tail. Every single move we make, from the mundane to the monumental... the red light we stop at, or run; the people we have sex with, or won't with us; the airplane we ride, or walk out of... is all a part of Death's sadistic design leading to the grave.
Please tell me I'm gonna get to see the Jets win the Super Bowl.
It broke!
What are you doing?
Knock it off!
I know what you're doing!  It's alright to be scared, Carter. You don't have to prove to us how big your balls are. Not now.
SHUT UP, BILLY!
Yeah.  Why not?
What do you call that?
Batteries not included.
Cocktail party.  Uh huh, right.  Let's saddle up.
Can't tell.  Pretty tall.  He's real scrunched up in that thing.
Roundeye.
I'm getting him out.
Brewer!  You know what that thing's packing?
You're gonna love it.
How do we get upriver?
How did you get started working for the spooks?
Why'd they want us?
I do?
Go United States.  See Nguyen. Maybe teach economics.  Buy Cadillac.  Watch "Dynasty."
Yes you can.
What was that?
What's the job?
Where?
Typical...
You think they'll find any?
Take your time.
But you're right... some people do get sacrificed.  Now tell me why you pulled the plug.
"Terminate with extreme prejudice."
You're out of your depth, Trautman. Way out.  I'm acting correctly here. Not you.  Not your gung-ho jungle ace.  It's over.  Walk away.
Who're you?
Hello, John.
Well, don't say it like that. It's not so...ya know, crazy an idea. You are a healthy woman... You hold a steady job. Ya not crossed eyed or anything...
Fine.
What?
Getting your nails done is one thing but going to dinner with a bunch of strangers and <u>him</u>... She didn't even look at him.
Holdin' my penis... What a lovely way of sayin' how Much ya like me...
Yep! Right on it!
It happens to be a beautiful love story.  Ya know, you used to like that about me.  You used to say you liked that I didn't make you think so much.  That we could be together and not think...
I can't tell you how distraught I was.  All night long.  What the hell happened?
I'm not seeing anyone else.  I really was attacked.
Lydia is the girl Parry likes... And I thought, if I could get them together I...
All right... Sorry... I feel indebted to him.
Well talk back.  He won't bite you.
Nothing it's just...I begining to understand you.
Bullshit!  If you're going to hurt me, you hurt me now -- not some long... drawn out hurt that takes weeks of my life because you don't have the balls!
Yeah so? The guy's beat up - he...he probably has a concussion or something, right?  He'll snap out of it?
No, Jack, no, it's not... She likes me.
Where you comin' from?!
Can I help you?
Can you tell me something? Did you lose your mind all of a sudden or was it a slow gradual process?
Come on now...You can't sit here.
People spend a lot of hard earned money for this neighborhood.  It's not fair... looking out their windows to see your ass asleep on the streets...
Can I ask that when you clean your hands you wipe the ink off the inside of the sink before it stains the stainless steel.
... First time in my life I'll be a voice with a body.  Do you know what that means?  What this could lead to?
How un-sixties of you.
Yes.
A list.
Well there....  What's the difference?
Hello. My name is Lydia Sinclair.
So how do we do this?
Now what?
Could you help me-- what was the name of that girl who just came in...
Have I died?
Where -- ?
They said you're The One.
A quest?
I'm not married.
Do you follow her every day?
Why did you do that?
Tch. You are so sweet...Now I know why you're saying this. ...You're afraid I'm in danger and you're trying to protect me.
Will you shut-up!!!
Listen, he just needs to sleep it off. Someone will take care of him.
It's such a great song.
.....What are you doing?
..Ha...Little fella? I mean the man talks to invisible people - he sees invisible horses - and he's naked in the middle of Central Park. I should be surprised? I'm not surprised. I'm fucking outta my mind to even be here!
YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR FUCKING MIND!!
In a bar called Hellfire.
...I feel so much for her...I feel like something awful is going to happen.
Beautiful night huh?
OWWW....What are you nuts?!
Parry Parry?
Well, we have plenty of those.  Right over here.  We got the MGM series, Astaire and Rogers, the Judy Garlands...
... Uh... we seem to be all out of Ethel Merman.
I don't drink coffee...
No.
We gotta get on home an' relieve the sitter. Why'nt you an' Ray come on over.
Now quit, Bobby. You said you're goin' a help me pick a song.
How 'bout if I just cut off your damn water?
Cerveza.
I'm tryin', baby, so don't start gettin' mad now.
Come on, DiPesto. We can still have a good time.
I know you're not.
I 'magine it's me then, id'n it?
This certainly is an improvement on the motel an' the coffee shop.  How could you have left such a beautiful place, Bobby?
Bobby...
Sure you don't want anything?
Look at my car! Piece of shit! I just bought it brand new from a used-car lot, and the steering goes to the pot on me!
I had to leave this place. I got depressed, seeing all the crap. And the thing is, they're making more crap, you know? They've got so many stores and stuff and junk full of crap, I can't believe it.
Fantastic! That you could figure all that out, and lay that down on her, to come up with a way you could get your toast.
No substitutions.
What do you mean, you don't have side orders of toast? You make sandwiches, don't you?
I don't make the rules.
You want me to hold the chicken.
She says you're the one that sells all the cars on TV.
I just can't look at you.
Oh.
No.
Well, Herbert's mostly on the mainland because of the orchestra, so at the moment, there's just Daddy, Carl and myself... and Van Oost.
He's not... They feel he... maybe he might not recover, and that he'll either...
Yeah... I guess so...
Oh God, I'm so glad, Robert, that you're coming...
It'll be so good for you, and for Daddy, because you know, you've never really...
I mean, you think I'm that happy?
Like what?
Oh, let's not talk about my hair, it does what it wants to, and anyway, who cares, I want to talk about you...
Well, you're not going to run out on me right away, are you?
With applesauce?
Bye, now.
Why?
Right now I'm going to run a hot tub and soak myself.
Wait...
Catherine...
No inner feeling.
Carl restored my confidence. He really did. He's much more substantial than you give him credit for.
That'll make you happy.
She's tremendously gifted, this girl.
I hope you feel at home, Robert.  I'm really glad you're here.
I've walked across a stage a number of times, without exciting any particular response...
No, I wouldn't.
There'd never be a hole big enough. Now took at me, for instance, when I was just one person, before Bobby, I had so much garbage collectin' onto me every day, I was thinkin' about gettin a dispose all...
Miss Dupea.
I have a suggestion. Why don't we take a break.
What?
What chu listening to rumors for? I'm not like dat.
I told you, no. I'm not that type.
Yo.
So you got a girl?
So wadda you do with your girls?
So what you think of me?
Come down!
Why don't you ask Eddie?
They are?
Yo, remember from the pool, that girl?
The one with the phat ass?
A bad attitude.
Now salsa, you know how to dance salsa?
You looking for somebody?
Where you know Amanda from?
I wasn't asking.
I think that's highly unlikely, Creasy.
Creasy, how old are you?
Hey you're really nuts.
Fletch F. Fletch
Your editor called me yesterday to respond to allegations you're about to print about police involvement in narcotics dealing. Fletch starts to get up, but Cummings plants his foot on Fletch's chest, forces him back down.
'Your men' might just be involved in all this.
Fat Sam left the beach today. So did Gummy. It began to occur to me that some things are beginning to happen that maybe I should be aware of.
That's my club too. I haven't seen you there.
Right, and how long have you had these pains, Mr. Barber?
Is she ever. I've got some stories....
Yes, but the very end, when he actually died, that was extremely sudden.  You know, Alan and I were recently speaking of dying. Told me Boyd Aviation took out a lot of insurance on him. You must have to be in some kind of perfect health to get that kind of policy.
Did I say 'kidneys'? I meant my ear. Maybe I should see an ear dahhh --  Ever serve time?
Gee, Alan's been looking kind of sick lately. Is he all right?
I hope they still fit. Do I get to keep the glove?
No idea at all?
Like when?
I think I’d rather have drugs.
Jesus.
Are you all right, Doctor?
Doctor Holmes went to get you some smelling salts. He was quite surprised that you fainted.
Until she remarries, Fletch.
Damn... lost again. Sorry.
Read this, please.
I was already prepared to commit one murder. What makes you think I won't commit two?
I'm Harry S. Truman from Casewell Insurance Underwriters.
My parents were great fans of the former President.
California. San Berdoo. Utah's part of my route. Can I ask you a few questions?
Regulations, Mr. Stanwyk. And you and your wife, named....
Okay.  Now, the last time you saw your son was when?
Forgive me now for seeming personal, but we understand that there is a lady friend he sees here in Provo.
Hi Sam. Hi Fletch.
Did it ever occur to you that I might not want to kill you?
Wouldn't they normally be locked?
What's the difference? The noise'll kill you first.
LAX. Go to the Pan Am desk. There will be a ticket waiting for you.
That's right.
Did you hear something?
W-Y-K no 'c.' I'll be down in a minute.
'...Stanwyk, blahblahblah, with internist Doctor Joseph Dolen.'
Did you say cops?
We used to fly together. I'm... John.
That's a strange combination.
Okay. I'm delighted to have someone to talk to, and you're very cute, so I'm very flattered, but I'm also very married so you may as well forget -- You are trying to hit on me, aren't you?
Hi.
You ordered it here?
Have you gotten cuter since I last saw you?
All this goes on Underhill's bill?
'I've acted out my life on stages, with ten thousand people watching...'
Are you still in love with Alan?
So?
Here's this dog that tried to eat me. Here's my motel. Here's the car I rented...
I was afraid you'd say that.
No.
I've never lied to him before.  It's the first time he's ever lied to me. He was just as convincing as when he says 'I love you.'
Oh God, I hate things that start like that....
I don't have all the pieces yet, but I'm close. I'll know tomorrow.
Oh, that's right. She told me to meet her there. That's cabana six?
I would, actually.
Muchas gracias.
No wonder.
Tell the cops.
I will, Frank, I will. Something came up, okay?
How gray?
More cops.  I think I gotta go to Utah, Frank.
I have some ideas.
Very possibly. Come on, say yes. I'll buy you a shirt.
It's also called getting me this close to being murdered.
You'll have it.
Apparently, someone of your acquaintance has charged the most extraordinary lunch to my bill.
You don't know the Underhills?
Mrs. Stanwyk!
But I ain't got you...
Sorry about the glass.  And the house.  And the breath.
Five thousand should be enough to assuage any qualms you have about my family tree.
Ah, the Dorothy Chandler.  I was just there with my good friend Art Mooney the other night...
Art Mo-o-o-ney!
You gotta shave before you leave the house in a dress like that and I don't mean your legs.  Why didn't you jump on her?  What's happening to you?
You're friends with the most obnoxious asshole on the airwaves. The King of the Shock Jocks.  I'm, I'm shocked.
That's for me... Radio contests, really Ford, how tacky...
Why did you interrupt?  Maxwell seemed like he wanted to hire me.
A fucking C.D.  Wow, this case is closed.  So, she's got bad taste in music and in men... Did I tell you she and Johnny were lovers and that they were into something and he got killed for it?
I wish I knew.  You did good work...
I'm sorry, that dress.  What do you say we...
Ah, an obvious choice.
Zuzu Petals!  Zuzu Petals!  Yes! Who killed Bobby Vomit?  Who killed Johnny Crunch?  Why do people want you so goddamn bad?
Let's get serious...
You hung out with Bobby Vomit. Who would want him dead?
Spunk, come back...
Because I know rock-n-roll.
Zuzu Petals, you're not bad.  In fact, I was discussing this whole rock-n-roll thing with my pal Art Mooney the other day.  You know him?
Yeah, it's weird.  Bobby and Johnny were such good friends...
Ford, you were right!
Ick.
Are you okay?
You-see-it-all-starts-with-this- factory-in-Vancouver-and there's these-C.D.s...
Hoh graphic!  I'm going to dream of ears for a year!  Ugh!
Fuck that, I mean, the heck with that.  I kicked their ass!  Well, I tried.  There were two of them you know...
Yeah, go on...
Nice tie, Lt. Anus, sir.
How's it going?
And if I told you that you already knew all that shit, and that you had them killed, what would you do then?
Kill them.  Not quickly.
Shit.
Yeah, it's pretty amazing how much cash you gotta give to the actual artists who create the music.  Those ingrates really take a bite.  But seriously, when Pops died, you got Vomit, Crunch, and Sutton to help finance a C.D. Cleans operation. You got greedy and they tried to get the three discs together to threaten you, but...
You heard that Bobby Vomit O.D.'d, right?  Do you suspect foul play and stuff?
Hi, private eye guy!
I am told it is difficult to pay the phone bill with gold chains and V.C.R.s.  There's four thousand here.
Where are you?
Takin' care o' business -- it's after midnight.
Sal --
What?
Did they follow you?
Allo... Salvatore...
Everything's smooth.  Beautiful.  I will need a few more days though, the boys think we oughta cool it for awhile -- make sure there's no heat.
Look, I'll level with you -- I need a little more time -- I got to shift gears.
It has to be by the end of this week.
Regarde mon pêcheur de baleine... Tu sais il va faire très froid cet hiver.
Mais non, c'est pour toi.
Le sommes nous?
Are you sure it is dead?
We must follow it.
There'll be someone else.
Look how gracefully they conceived that arch.  Like a bowstring.  It was built from both ends.  With no support in the middle.  Beautiful.
You're in show business.
What about you, Doyle?  Who's the best fighter you ever seen?
I got this little chick I'm tryin' to hit on.  She's about 20, 21... I take her to Jilly's last night and she's tellin' me about how she wants to settle down one day, get married... I says, "Hey, this is 1971, baby, I'm just a dirty old man lookin' to score with some pussy."
Never trust anybody.  You goin' sick?
I make at least two junk connections at that table in the corner.  The guy is the stripe combo, I know him too.
No, you?
No sir -- this is where Joel lives.
We got information that there's no shit in the street -- it's like a desert full of junkies with a big score coming in to make everybody well.
Popeye.
It's Cloudy.  Open the door.
Why not?
Throw 'em in the bathroom, will you? How good are the warrants?
Can you use a new suit for Christmans?
Pass.
There are four auto graveyards like this one in the other boroughs, handling about a thousand vehicles a month.  Those that aren't claimed are auctioned here once a month.
No.  Many are involved in crimes and confiscated... or just abandoned. This is, as you know, your prime source of scrap metal, M. Charnier.
I'm afraid the rest of Ward's Island isn't nearly as romantic - a pollution plant, a hospital, a training school for garbage men and that area over there, where the old cars are kept, prior to being processed for shipment to, among other places, The Charnier Shipping Company, of Marseilles, France.
Yeah.
Sexual assault, Daryl.  Five years.  But you got lucky, right?  You got away with something else.  Something you figured nobody knows about.
Oh, my God!  What is that?!  Why you showing me this shit!?  JESUS!  JESUS! Get those away from me!
How do we get to the vault door?
Frank.  We gotta go back.  Frank...
Butch called.
Where's Johnny?
I'm off.
Satch, you gotta just give me...Satch is here John.  You hear me?  Satch is here.
What is going on here, Satch?  What are those guys doing out there?
Frank, this is not the time to be worried about covering up if you had a thing with this girl.
What if I could prove it to you, Satch?
The next batter, Clendenon, hits one outta the park.
You missed a hell of a game, Frank.
Looks like two weeks worth of allowance, Chief.
Yes!  That's it!  You got it, you got it! Way to go, Chief!
Uh, hello?
Listen, you can't broadcast without a license.  Unless this is an emergency, you gotta get off the band.
I'm right with you, man.  He's got the heart of a lion.  Hey, how 'bout the first game of the Series?
The World Series.  You called Buford's homer.
You call your son Little Chief?
What's going on?
You just burned the desk.
That's impossible.
Yeah, that's how Hams work.
Thirty-five?  That would make it...
You're still my Little Chief, right?
No wait, don't go!
Why?
We're doing all right, Dad.  We're doing good.
What are you talking about?
Why not just get the cops to watch the bar?
What are we like in...1998?
Yeah, you betcha.
This is wrong...it's like we cheated...
We got him!  Dad you got him!
Listen to me, very carefully, take your wallet out, just touch it on the corners.
Hey, Sull.  My cable's out again.
My father didn't die in a fire?
Our lucky break.  Mario ID'd the dental. Mary Finelli...reported missing April 16, 1968.
I thought it'd be nicer to eat here.
No kiddin'?
Hell-
Who the fuck is this?
Going?  How do you mean?
You're all just jealous.
What're you gonna do?
So what would a weekend in the country be without sex?
We'd be all alone.  We could do anything we wanted and nobody would see.
How do we do it?
Destroy the evidence?  No, man!
Derek... stop.
You can say... "Hello, how are you?"... for starters.
Just slow down.  Let me get to know you again.  Let me get to know this place again.
What do you mean?
You know him?
What d'ya got in there?
In that little thing?
What are we gonna do?
Faster!  Eat faster!
Please... be cool.
This is no time to celebrate!
What're you doing?
Will you hurry up!  I gotta get this fuckmobile back before Horace finds out I took it.
That's right.  Just drive toward him.  He'll move.  Nobody wants to die.
It's kinda frightening to think that a kid like that can go so far over the edge.  Jason really screwed up the poor sonofabitch's mind.
Of course not.  If he hasn't already accidentally pelleted himself, I'm sure he's lost.
Once we nail Roy, that's it. Victory is ours.
Come on, Dad.  You could have Rick drive down Cunningham Road and look for them.
Yeah, hi.  Listen, I've got to talk to your dad.  About Jason. I've got a plan.  I need to buy some things first but mainly need help to...
What?
There...Ya happy?
Okay, give it back.
Sorry, Megan.  Not this time.
Are you sure this is gonna work? I mean, why didn't we bring that gun and just blast him away?
Okay, listen...what's your name, sweetie?
...Good.  So no more bad dreams can come around here, huh?
You know what?  Sissy and Cort are playing jokes.  You know, trying to scare each other.
I can't believe no one called back.  I better...
Why not?  I used to play it alone. I love murder games.  Have you ever played The Consulting Detective?
I just realized something. Where's Cort?  I haven't seen him for hours.
He didn't say anything?
If you'd just go to the cemetery, you'll see I'm not lying.
I sympathize with you kids.  The best I can do is call the station in Carpenter and have them keep a lookout for them.
I was going to call the clinic and have them collect your ass.  But I don't want you around here any longer poisoning my daughter, or anyone else, with your warped mind.
I understand.  However, our audience should be aware that you only charged forty thousand dollars to catch the Idaho skin stretcher.
...but there just may not be enough time.  If you still care about her, if you still want to try to make things better between you two...we should talk.
You have to...save...Jessica... Save Jessica and save the...
I know who you are.
Look --
Everything going okay?
I gotta get back to work.
Listen...don't you worry about Ed. He'll come around.  He's too good a Sheriff to let you give him the slip.
Get up!
Jessica, I'm so sorry.  I...I wanted to have this cleaned up before you got here.
She's beautiful.
It was a community service.
...and it's now ringing...ringing... and -- Hello? Anthony's Pizzeria? Yeah, this is officer Randy Parker over at the station.
Randy, you dipshit!  Take these off!
I'll be back later.  You just be cool, okay.
I've told you the truth.
About Jessica.
You call what you did bad?!  You knocked her up and then left her!
I'm literally going to kill you!
But she might be in trouble...
I think it's time for some recreational activity, girl.
I guess not.
A real space cadet. I wonder if she'll narc on us...
What's wrong?
Right.
All right, all right -- I'm a major ass.
And I'll never do it again. Forgive me?
But I thought...
Dear Christ...
That's it. You're not setting foot off this ship until we return home.
Let's go -- we're running two minutes late.
You have no right...
Did you find Rennie?
What a beautiful day.
You're making a big mistake, Rennie. It's not too late to put you back on land.
Why are you doing this to yourself?
You pushed me...
Stephen King supposedly used it when he was in high school.
I can't swim.
I had a skiing accident in high school, broke my left leg. It took three winters before I would even look at the snow again...but the solution kept eluding me.  I finally took lessons. I've never broken a bone since.
Maybe not. But you're not telling me everything, are you?
Did you have an accident in the lake?
The Captain and Chief Engineer... they've been...they're dead.
I opened thousands of brains.
A lovely piece of theater. Small but important.
Very dangerous.
I'm trying to think. When did you start looking so terrible? You look awful.
What happened eighteen months ago?
And he was there?
You say we go?
I gave it away. I thought, I'm a writer now.
In other words why should we suffer silently at this kind of abuse? The man is out there ruining lives.
Shoot him.
How do you Eknow.
Had to be him.
This could be it.
Let's work on it.
Alan's very sick. He has to go to New Mexico and sit in a lukewarm solution.
You mean the World Series? I thought the Red Sox were winning.
I never see you anymore. Where are you all day?
Do you want to get some coffee?
I'm seeing your play tonight, remember?
So at the intermission I can listen to the ball game. Do you know that mother is seeing a prominent divorce lawyer?
She's doing like those Iranians. `I divorce thee. I divorce thee. I divorce thee'
Oh please. Not now.  She wants you to stop seeing What's- Her-Name. Finally. Now and forever. Do you think that's too much to ask? For a wife of nineteen years.
Can we talk later? Will you be at the party?
What will we talk about?
If you're wondering about the firearm.
Knowing who a person is. Down deep.
Am I really so deeply repugnant?
See, Daddy.
I'll have whatever she's having.
And you've been extremely patient.
I went because you went. You smoked because I smoked.
I am really, deeply sorry.
It was an animal thing. No real intimacy.
We did it in the office. She thought her apartment was too impersonal.
All the failures, all the fatalism.
Who is it?
Nicky comes on Sunday's.
Across Ninth Avenue. Dodgie's. Where you've been getting your hair cut for fifty years. Where Uncle Billy and Uncle Marty got their hair cut. Where Jim Rorty shot a man for cheating at poker.
Of course they're gonna lose. We'll watch them lose. What good is heartbreak if we don't experience it firsthand?
A grandmother. God bless you.
Frankie Lazzaro. Coming down the courthouse steps every day in the media. Children see this. They think you're the Secretary of the Treasury.
Say it and you'll believe it. Life is good. Say it.
They're my team, too. I grew up on Boyleston Street. Right by Fenway Park. I went to fifty or sixty games a year. All by myself. I was one of those kids with scabby elbows. I called out to the players. `Look over here. Hi, I'm Steven. My parents are divorced.'
And you're not saying that because of the gun in my hand?
Game six is history,pal.
Finally, I get a waiter who doesn't know "Macbeth".
Sidney remains optimistic.
Yes.
Yes.
And the Father replies?
Oh. You know him.
And he has finer moments now and then.
Endearing.
Elliot wants to kill him with a railroad spike.
So do I. Over and over.
Would you like to meet him?
No one's waiting.
You've come to me. I wanted to believe you would one day.
In other words I never understood until today how much pain and anxiety you've been causing with your reviews. Steven, it's so unfair.
Yes. I've seen your victims. One past and one future. I thought I might convince you to reconsider.
Oww!
It is the work of untouchables.
I am your wife.
"Take a fifth step, that we may serve the people."
Enough.
You'd be Gandhi --  ...I thought you'd be bigger.
You're a clergyman.
What are you doing?
Not quite. They're only "holding me" until the Magistrate's hearing. Then it will be prison.
If I want to be one with them, I have to live like them.
They're calling you "Bapu." I thought it meant father.
...and I knew something had to give. And I was determined to be here when it did.
Tell me -- do you think about hell?
Well, it's quite a place, your "ashram" -- is that right?
And you've come all this way because you think something is going to happen?
Do you remember much of South Africa?
You've done me a great service.
Are you going to walk all the way?
It is foolish if it is just to save the life of an old man.
Who is that young man?
It must have been the only Non-violent campaign ever led by a man who wanted to kill everybody every day.
They are preparing for war. I will not support it, but I do not intend to take advantage of their danger.
Well, then, it must be fought. We are children of God like everyone else.
If we hold firm, it won't be the last.
Will you have a glass of sherry?
Hm. Of course it is not quite that simple.
...There's been no time to keep figures, but there must be ninety -- a hundred thousand under arrest.  And it still goes on.
Ah -- we should invite Gandhi. What the devil has happened to him anyway?
Have you read his magazine?
Could we cut all news off? I know --
There are a few million miles to go yet.
Is there any reason you'd want a left-handed child?
So you've finally seen sense and come back to your old job, Vincent.
No?  What's keeping you?
Even if this Vincent Luca <i>is</i> alive, is it likely he could bludgeon a man to death?
You know their workforce.  Two-thirds at least fall into the category.  We'll be closing down their operation for days.  At least go with a fingertip sample or urine.
We don't have the manpower.
It's not <i>exactly</i> him.
Right now, <i>your</i> presence is creating more of a threat.  I don't think you have any concept of what we do here--how meticulous our preparations must be.  We are about to send twelve people through 140 million miles of blackness to rendezvous with an object the size of a house and the color of coal.  So it's rather critical to point them in the right direction. And we certainly don't need you looking over our shoulders.  Besides, I don't believe there is any evidence that the killer <i>is</i> amongst us.  I don't see too many other dead bodies littering the place.
That's where we get rid of the traces of him although we never truly succeeded.
Okay, how tall did you <i>used</i> to be?
You okay, Jerome?
God, what <i>wouldn't</i> you do to leave the planet?
What an act of benevolence--a service to the community.  So that's it.  Now there's nothing between you and ignition.
This calls for a celebration.  Doesn't it?
I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.
They'll recognize me.
Not thirsty?  We've got enough virgin samples to last us the week.
Never stopped you before.  And for God's sake stop plucking your hair. Someone went to a lot of trouble to make sure you wouldn't go bald.
Hello?
How are you, Jerome?
Where are you going?
You've already specified blue eyes, dark hair and fair skin.  I have taken the liberty of eradicating any potentially prejudicial conditions - premature baldness, myopia, alcoholism and addictive susceptibility, propensity for violence and obesity--
What will happen to the others?
Vincent...Vincent...
My wife and I--we're thinking of starting a family.
Hugo!  I've found him!
Looks bad, doesn't it, Irene?  What about <i>you?</i>  Where were you last night?
It was a mercy-killing after all.
Perhaps we ought to celebrate, Irene.
Why are we leaving?
Who are they?
--when you go away.
If everything goes to plan, this could be the last time I see you for a while.  One week to go.  Please tell me you're the least bit excited.
Just remember, Lamar, I could have gone up and back and nobody would have been the wiser--
What are you doing?
Rudy Butler, Frank Jackson...
Sure,  You're working on the passports...  ... and visas?
Close... but it takes a hell of a lot more than promises to pull the kind of strings I pulled.
You want to drive?
Where do you want to go?
What's Beynon got set up?
Just like old times?
Where did you get them developed?
Half a million.
What do you want for dinner?
How does it taste?
You been okay?
How's Estelle?
I was going to fix you breakfast.
$250,000 right off the top.
Thanks again.  I 'm glad you waited.
Yeah... I know.
Why are you laughing?
Nail him first, be careful he doesn't panic and want to shoot somebody. Local police have one car, a rover, shouldn't be in the vicinity at the time we hit unless it's answering an emergency call... if the cop car shows up remember it doesn't have any automatic weapons. Only a shotgun braced on the dashboard. Get into a tight spot, you'll be out of range at forty yards. Then they're down to their side guns.
It doesn!t make much difference where you are, if you're waiting, Doc.
When I got out, why didn't you tell me where it was?
He must have.
How long ago.
There better be a guy with the
Do you mean that?
We'll grab a room for tonight then you go out tomorrow and buy yourself some new clothes, pick some up for me... Grab some food now, paper bag it, we eat in the room.
You've got it all figured.
You can't trust anything these days.
I trust...  Want to see what I trust... In God we trust...  The word's on every bill!!!
How much?
No scars?
Do what I tell you, it's not a game.
No more about Beynon.
Sounds good.
You're crazy.
I don't know, airport I guess.
You wouldn't be taking the train to Salt Lake, would you?
Three years ago I dynamited some fish at the reservoir.
Can I help you?
All right. Shells?
Gonna knock down a wall?
Yeah. I got out.
When she gets here, have that kid of yours help her with the suitcase.
How was that?
Where we go in1?
I guess you ain't gonna shoot me, are you?
Let's just get to the border.
Well, I paid a hell of a price. Now for God's sake keep your mouth shut.
Is it possible, Mrs. Clinton?
What kind of car do you have, Harold?
I got a nurse in mind.
The three of us are going to do some traveling. We're going to take your car to El Paso.
Hello, Jack,  I don't know anything, Jack.
I didn't know who Doreen was. Thought she was just another bird.
You knew what I'd do.
I made a mistake.
Bloody well tell me who sent you.
Five grand. It belongs to you. Along with a little name I'm going to give you.
You shouldn't have shown the film to Frank.
Address?
Everyhing go off all right?
She's nothing to do with me.
Why'd you see him so regular?
I don't believe you, Margaret. Frank wasn't like that.  I'm the villain in the family, remember?
I know him too.
Yes.
You didn't know you had a fairy godmother, did you?
A fairy godmother, all of your own. Aren't you lucky?
To the demon king's castle, of course.
Does Brumby get a kick out of that crap?
The young girl. Who pulled her?
And you didn't know her last name?
You coming to South America?
Where you going to live, then?
Keith, if anybody comes in here and asks for me, you let me know. Right?
How'd you know Albert?
What happened to you, then?
I'm staying with a friend.
I'll call the police.
What'll they do to him?
What about Keith?
Do you want breakfast?
Did you sleep well?
Are you tired?
Eric. Eric Paice.
What's it to you anyway?
That's not always a healthy way to be...
Scotch, please.
Are we here to play cards or talk about the old days?
What's that?
You have to cheer up, George, you aren't out yet.
The whole fuckin' thing...The pressure's just too great.  You're ab...you're absolu...they're too important.  All of them.  You go in the door.  I..."I got to close this fucker, or I don't eat lunch," "or I don't win the Cadillac..." We fuckin' work too hard.  You work too hard.  We all, I remember when we were at Platt...huh?  Glen Ross Farms... didn't we sell a bunch of that..."
They did.
We're stuck with this...
Who?
That's what I'm saying.  Why?  The leads.  He's got the good leads... what are we, we're sitting in the shit here.  Why?  We have to go to them to get them.  Huh.  Ninety percent our sale, we're paying to the office for the leads.
What do you need? A telephone, some broad to say "Good morning," nothing...nothing...
Yes.  It is.  It is simple, and you know what the hard part is?
You build it!
Someone should stand up and strike back.
Something.  To pay them back.  Someone, someone should hurt them. Murray and Mitch.
And you're saying a fella could take and sell these leads to Jerry Graff.
As an idea.
Did you?
Yes.  I said, "Not actually." The fuck you care, George?  We're just talking...
Because, because, you know, it's a crime.
You're going to steal the leads?
Did I say that?
He'd give me a job.
Dave.
Oh, yes, George.
You wouldn't, George, that's why I'm talking to you.  Answer me. They come to you.  You going to turn me in?
...I thought that we were only talking...
That's ridiculous.
I didn't ask to be.
Well, well, well, talk to me, we sat down to eat dinner, and here I'm a criminal...
In the abstract...
And why is that?
Then, you know, they wouldn't be so ups...
Yes.  They are old.
Yes.  I'm no fucking good.
Everything I...you know...
The cops?
Why don't you think so?
Where were you?
See...?  Were you the guy who broke in?
Yes.
Did they...?
Shelly, the Machine, Levene.
That's great.
...how can you talk to me that... that...
What?
I want to work today, that's why I came...
Moss...Who told him?
And I don't want any fucking shit and I don't give a shit, Lingk puts me over the top, you filed it, that's fine, any other shit kicks out you go back.  You...you reclose it, 'cause I closed it and you...you owe me the car.
You have a problem?
Would you come in here, please?
Shelly...
...I only...
Marshal the leads...marshal the leads?  What the fuck, what bus did you get off of, we're here to fucking sell.  Fuck marshaling the leads.  What the fuck talk is that? What the fuck talk is that?  Where did you learn that?  In school?  That's "talk," my friend, that's "talk." Our job is to sell.  I'm the man to sell.  I'm getting garbage.  You're giving it to me, and what I'm saying is it's fucked.
Yes.
The premium leads.  Yes.  I know what they cost.  John.  Because I, I generated the dollar revenue sufficient to buy them.  Nineteen senny-nine, you know what I made? Senny-nine?  Ninety-six thousand dollars.  John?  For Murray... For Mitch...look at the sheets...
Money.  A fortune.  Money lying on the ground.  Murray?  When was the last time he went out on a sit? Sales contest?  It's laughable. It's cold out there now, John. It's tight.  Money is tight.  This ain't sixty-five.  It ain't.  It just ain't.  See?  See?  Now, I'm a good man--but I need a...
That's fucked.  That's fucked.  You don't look at the fucking percentage. You look at the gross.
Then put me on the board.
Of what?
I wish I could.
Can't do it.
Why?
Yes.  I hear you.
You said, "You don't make something up unless it's sure to help."  How did you know that I made it up?
I told the customer that his contracts had gone to the bank.
What'd you do with the leads?  You want to go in there?  I tell him what I know, he's going to dig up something...You got an alibi last night?  You better have one. What did you do with the leads?  If you tell me what you did with the leads, we can talk.
I...I'm sure he got more than the five, actually.
Okay: I...look: I'm going to make it worth your while.  I am.  I turned this thing around.  I closed the old stuff, I can do it again. I'm the one's going to close 'em. I am!  I am! 'Cause I turned this thing a...I can do that, I can do anyth...last night.  I'm going to tell you, I was ready to Do the Dutch.  Moss gets me, "Do this, we'll get well..." Why not.  Big fuckin' deal.  I'm halfway hoping to get caught.  To put me out of my...  But it taught me something.  What it taught me, that you've got to get out there.  Big deal.  So I wasn't cut out to be a thief.  I was cut out to be a salesman.  And now I'm back, and I got my balls back...and, you know, John, you have the advantage on me now: Whatever it takes to make it right, we'll make it right.  We're going to make it right.
The check's no good?
Those fuckin' deadbeats...
"You do get the opportunity...You get them.  As I do, as anyone does..."
Rick.  Let me tell you.  Wait, we're in the...
Williamson, get on the phone, call Mitch...
When?
Harriett...
...yes...
I wanted to speak with you about...
Mr. Morton's with American Express... he's...  I can tell Jim what you do...?
No.  You said the one.  That's why you said we couldn't talk till Kenilworth.
What?
Yes.
Or a piss...?  A great meal fades in reflection.  Everything else gains.  You know why? 'Cause it's only food.  This shit we eat, it keeps us going.  But it's only food. The great fucks that you may have had.  What do you remember about them?
I've got to talk to you...
Monday.
I don't know.  They said we have three days.  They said we have three days.
No, I don't know.  Tell me.
I don't understand.
No, I'm saying you don't include Saturday...in your three days. It's not a business day.
What was yesterday?
I told you.
She wants her money back.
...what, what, say it.  Say it to me...
What power?
Cop couldn't find his dick two hands and a map.  Anyone talks to this guy's an asshole...
Mountain View.  Eight units.
What is this, your farewell speech?
Listen to me: They got some of them.
They took some of the con...
You closed him yesterday.
Yes.
Aren't you going out today?
I don't "want" it, if you catch my drift.
Three?  I count two.
Yes.
Vitone!  Our driver has drunk too much wine.
Constanzia.  We expected you last week; we sent the car to pick you up at the airport last week.
It means we should all live happily for one hundred years.  The family. If my Father were alive, it'd be true.
Listen, Michael's got a lot of nice people here.  Friends of Kay's. He'll never forgive me if you ruin his party.
I wanta dance...whatsa matter with that?
I don't want to stay here...
You tell your friends I expect them to let me wet my beak in the same manner.  Don't be afraid to tell them.  Clemenza and I know each other well, he understands these things.  Let yourself be guided by him.  He has more experience in these matters.
Ten to one shot, you said.  Ten to one shot in my favor, and I lose.
Why'd you do it, Frankie?  After all these years, why'd you turn against him?
Oh, 'scuse me.
Oh.  Mikey, what's up?  I'm totally in the dark.
I never met them.
No.  No, I didn't.  Who tells me anything?  I been kept in the dark so long, I'm getting used to it.
Jeeze, it's great you came along, Mike... You know, we've never spent a night out on the town together. I always thought you looked down on me for liking a good time.
How is your wife, Fredo...your marriage?
It was never Pentangeli... I've always known that.  It was Roth all along.  He talks to me as a son; as his successor, but the old man thinks he'll live forever.
I was kept pretty much in the dark. I didn't know all that much.
Beautiful.
What did I tell you.  The one who cut him was found in an alley.  And the family of the others paid Fanucci all their savings to make him forswear his vengeance.
It's Michael's request...for your safety.  We can send out for anything you need.
Kay, Michael didn't tell me a lot; and what he did tell me, I can't repeat.  But the responsibility for you and the kids was the most important thing he left me with.
Where's my wife?
Why didn't someone tell me!
You're going to talk to him now.
Tom isn't going to sit in with us, Johnny.  He only handles specific areas of the family business.  Tom?
What was it, so I'll know.
I want it met.
It might show.
I got to ask questions, Tom, there's three million dollars cash in that pouch; Mike is gone and I have no word from him.
The High Court of Israel turned down his request to live as a 'returned Jew.' His passport's been invalidated except for return to the U.S.  He landed in Buenos Aires yesterday, offered a gift of one million dollars if they would give him citizenship.  They turned him down.
Everything is going to be okay, Frankie, don't worry.
Yeah, but don't worry.
You're right.
Frankie, you were always interested in politics, in history.  I remember you talking about Hitler back in '43.  We were young then.
The Roman Empire... when a plot against the Emperor failed, the plotters were always given a chance to let their families keep their fortunes.
No strings.
You paid off thirty grand I never owed.
Sir, my client has answered every question asked by this committee with the utmost cooperation and sincerity.  He has not taken that Fifth Amendment as it was his right to do, and which because of the extreme legal complexity of this hearing, counsel advised him to do. So, I think in all fairness this committee should hear his statement and put it in the record.
Yes.
I'm going to the market.
Why don't you sit down?
Why too late?
On a plane back to Sicily.
When he saw his brother in the hearing room, he knew what was at stake.  I don't think Vincenzo would have done it.  He loves the kids, too. Omerta, Kay.  Honor, silence.  It had nothing to do with me.  It was between those brothers.
I won't let you leave!  Christ, do you think I'm going to let you leave.
No, I don't want to hear anything. There are things between men and women that will not change; things that have been the same for thousands of years.  You are my wife, and they are my children... and I love you and I will not let you leave, because you are MINE!
We'll go back tonight.  Bring the children.
I know what it meant... and I'm prepared to make it up to you.  I will make changes; I can.  I CAN change; that I have learned, that I have the strength to change... And we have another child, a boy... and you'll forget the miscarriage.
You're a considerate young man.
It's always bad for business; but you have no choice.
Enjoy.
You have to be careful what you say in front of the others... they frighten easy.  It's always been that way, most men frighten easy.
I just left our friend in Miami.
Not good.
They asked him to sign paper to take down the markers; but he got mad; told them to wait until he was finished.
This witness has testified that you are personally responsible for the murder of a New York Police Captain in the year 1947 and with him a man named Virgil Sollozzo.  Do you deny this?
Is it true that in the year 1950 you devised the murder of the heads of the Five Families in New York, to assume and consolidate your nefarious power?
Clemenza promised them nothing, he hated the sonsuvbitches.
Michael, you're sitting up here in the Sierra Mountains with champagne cocktails making judgment on the way I run my family.
How can you be fair with animals? They recruit niggers and spicks; they do violence in their own Grandmother's neighborhoods.  And everything is dope and whores; the gambling is left to last.  Let me run my family without you on my back.  I want them taken care of.
You give your loyalty to a Jew over your own blood.
Don Corleone, I wish you let me know you was coming.  We could have prepared something for you.
I want you to help me take my revenge.
I want you to settle these troubles with the Rosato Brothers.
My lawyer, Tom Hagen.  He arranged this all through your man Turnbull.
The Corleone family controls two major hotels in Vegas; one in Reno. The licenses were grandfathered in, so you had no difficulties with the Gaming Commission.  But I have the idea from sources...  ...that you're planning to move in on the Tropicana.  In another week or so you'll move Klingman out, which leaves you with only one technicality.  The license, which is now in Klingman's name.
We're all part of the same hypocrisy, Senator.  But never think it applies to my family.
Are we going to eat or what?
You want a war?
What's this?
I've already rented it; I cannot disappoint the new tenants.  They're paying a higher rent.
Excuse me, I hope I am not a disturbance, Don Corleone.
Your good heart in helping the poor widow has shamed me, and I want to show that I, too, have some Christian charity.  Her rent will remain what it was.
Thanks, doll.
What makes you say that?
Yeah, well keep your filthy thoughts to yourself.
These old movies are such a hoot. They thought they were being scary, but they're just funny.
You picked up that girl right in front of me.
No, I'm actually kind of glad it happened.  It made me wonder what the hell I was doing with my life. Letting you pull me into bed whenever the spirit moved you.
Don't worry, you already paid me. I'm here because --
Gimme a break.  I'm going to sit on my ass while he draws pictures.  Is that going to hurt him?
How long you worked for Mr. Whale?
I bet you've seen a lot of famous people come and go?  Movie stars?
What is the good English?  All I know is bugger.  He is a bugger. Men who bugger each other.
I need to talk to you about Mr. Whale.
Maybe.  But I still need to talk. Do I have time for a cup of coffee before I go?
What have you done with him?
Sat for an artist.  Been sketched.
You have the most architectural skull.  And your nose.  Very expressive.
But expressively broken.  How did it happen?
Indeed.  I'd pay for the privilege of drawing your head.
I'm sorry.  It's too white, too distracting.  Would it be asking too much for you to take it off?
We could wrap this like a toga around your shoulders.  Would that help you overcome your schoolgirl shyness?
There's something about the openness of your face that makes me want to speak the truth.  Yes, my family ate dripping.  Beef dripping and four to a bed, and a privy out back in the alley.  Are you also from the slums, Mr. Boone?
You have to excuse me, Mr. Boone. Since my stroke, I am often overcome with nostalgia.
Do you mind?
I liked it.  We all did.
No.
Why?  Was it supposed to be funny?
I'll pay our going rate.  Plus what you'd get if you did the hedges.
Does that surprise you?
I never thought you were.
I hope this has nothing to do with your refusing to sit for me today?
Sorry.  Not today.
Tell me more about yourself, Mr. Boone.  You have a steady companion?
Ah.  A philosopher.
And the fear you showed at our last session?  How did you overcome that?
Very good, Clayton.  May I call you Clayton?  Or do you prefer Boone?
What was that about?
I'd like to try again.  If you're game.
You are much too human.
Why?
I don't know.
Did I hurt you?
Need some help?
I can undress myself, thank you.
Where's Betty?
Then take the pills.
What are you doing here?
Should you be drinking in your condition?
But I have no reputation.  I'm as free as the air.
I didn't ask George to invite you.
Oh no, my dear.  You look absolutely amazing.  There's no way I can compete with you.  The scene is yours.
I would've thought Mr. Leslie Howard would be more your line.
Hanna?  Who's the new yardman?
She is horrible.
Okay.  "Frankenstein."  Tell me everything.
Oh my God.  What's wrong, Mr. Whale?  Is it your heart?
I was going to take a swim.
I commend you.  If you're going to pursue poofs, go after those who can do favors for you.  You waste everybody's time when you court dinosaurs.
How's the leg?
It's been a long time, Memphis --
It seems she neglected to mention it
Who was the job for?
Yeah -- ?
Randall Raines ... It's been a long time ...  frowns) 'though I do I recall you as a man with style. You remember your old friend, Atley -- ?
I'm just here about my brother.
Well, now, he's clear. And you'll stay away from him...
Leg's all banged-up. He made a stupid play ... He'll limp around the yard up at Folsom. But Astricky will be there to take care of him. With their priors, they're looking at a serious bounce --
You'll leave -- ?
You have my word...
I remember us having made some kind of deal, Randall. I don't remember this deal having some kind of time-limit. I look at you - here - in my town - and I'm confused...
I hope it's not your dear sweet mother...
You're thinking: okay, there's no want ... But they probably stripped its guts and crated 'em up, right ... ?
What's this -- ?
It just ain't happening --
okay ...
Yeah.
What's the matter?
You ever feel bad about any of this?
Lookit Kip. All grown up...
You guys have any skills at all?
Damn. Memphis Raines. Long time ...
Most of 'em are late-model...
Eleanor is Memphis' "unicorn."
A bunch of strung-out hypes and stick- up men. This ain't like the old days, Memphis. The profession has lost its..
Jesus. The whole damn thing's loaded.
Walked like a bastard... Skippin' stones and shit..
Okay, okay. What about MAGNUM P.I.?
What are you doing back?
You ever wonder what things'd be like if he hadn't died?
I remember. Supper getting cold, cos you two are out there heads under hoods ...
D.W.P. Thanks for holding. How can I help you?
Yes. can you hold, sir -- ?
okay, sir. Let me just get the-order. Yes. We'll be doing some work out your way. We've got a power leak. And it's unsafe. We're moving residences to the... Marriott Long Beach ... Just for the night ...
We'll take it...
Hey, Kip, what's up?
It looks just like a regular Mustang --
Any more ...
No...
Jesus, Kip ... I'm shot, man ...
You okay -- ?
You sure you're okay -- ?
You're kind of cultivating a new look.
You can handle it?
You can handle it?
You?
You?
What are you doing here?
You spread it out ... you move around... So's they can't touch you... so's they don't know... Shadow games and shit ...
What era was that -- ?
That's strange. I'm nervous. Donny's nervous. Everyone's nervous. But not you...
What did I tell you? What? What did I tell you?
You remember where you got this Eleanor -- ?
Okay. We're all here. Today's Wednesday. D-Day is Friday night ... That gives us two days to prep ... We're going to find the ladies on our list, find out where they live, when they're home; that they're properly insured ... Let's get into the vans --
Jim Rockford. ROCKFORD FILES.
I left town. I didn't leave you.
And here I am...
Hey.
No whistles, but a Club You bring a hack -- ?
So, you seeing anybody?
Unlock your button ...
With a twist of my wrist ... You're turned over ...
Donny got shot ... A jacker ...
You okay -- ?
You remember Junie?
Whatever do you mean?
I heard rumors you were back. About Kip ...
Tell me...
You need him...
Okay. All our ladies should be home now, tucked in bed. Let's keep chilly. Think Slow. Any questions?
Uh ... Randall -- ?
What do you want, shithead?
Why don't you leave him alone?
What? What happened?
But he was always a bad kid, that one.
Hey, look at him. Tommy. You grew up.
Don't go busting my balls. Okay?
You remember Tommy's shines? The kid was great.  He made mirrors.
I warned you a million times.
Paulie.  You're all I got.  I need help.
I didn't know, I swear.  I thought it was next week.
What're you doing? What about the car?
I Don't know. I don't know if I could live that way. What if, God forbid, you go to prison. Mickey said Jeannie's husband --
Don't lie to me. I saw her name in the register.
You want her to visit you?  Good! Let her stay up all night crying and writing letters to the parole board.
It's only you and me. That's what happens when you go away. We're on our own. Forget everybody.  Forget Paulie.  As long as he's on parole he doesn't want anybody doing anything.
Then you're safer in here.
Who's gonna do that?
I flushed it down the toilet.
What are we going to do with him? We can't dump him in the street.
You got money for your bullshit television, don't you?  I gotta watch you swimming back and forth on TV all night long, don't I? You got money for that, but you don't have my money?
Give'm a drink.
Don't worry about it.
Paulie's gonna make him?
Watch this.
I do it all the time. Bust their fucking balls.
You want the melon?
I better call again.
I can't eat,  just get me some coffee.
It's that rat bastard from Pittsburgh. He ratted you all out. He's been a rat since he got busted in Pittsburgh.
It's a fait accompli?
Now this is important. Make sure you leave the house when you make the call. You understand? Do you hear me? It's important.  Call from an outside phone. I mean it.
Come on, relax. He's drunk.  He's been locked up for six years.
Tommy.  Come on. Relax.
Is it my fault she won't go out without her girlfriend?  For Chrissake.  Come on.  You don't even have to stay.  Jeesuz!  What's the big deal?
I don't need this... You said tonight and now it's not tonight...
Did he say what they're asking him about?
Driving you crazy?  Don't get me started.  You're here a month and sometimes I know he doesn't come home at all. What kind of people are these?
Do?  What can you do?  What did you expect?  He wasn't Jewish. Did you know bow they live?  Your father would never stay out this late without calling.  In thirty years he never stayed out all night.
If you knew those fucking kids. They're nuts. Especially that Tommy. What am I going to do with them?
Well you know how he loves animals right? Anyway, last week he's drivin' home... 
Chuckie, what the fuck happened?
She's sharp as a marble.
I didn't get on Cathy last night.
Thanks, Chuck.
Sorry, brother.  I don't know what to tell ya. You know all the girls I been with. You been with 'em too, except for Cheryl McGovern which was a big mistake on your part brother...
You and Morgan throw?
Okay.
I'm glad you came by, changed my opinion of Harvard people.
How'd you know where to find me?
See, now this doesn't feel right.  When I made the decision to come over here it felt right. I had all these rationalizations... I just don't understand why Will never tells me anything, he won't let me get close to him, he tells me these weird lies--
--That isn't funny--
Would you shut the fuck up! I know what you ordered, I was there!
My uncle can probably get you on my demo team.
Holy shit.
It's a good thing no one's Irish here.
What's up guys?
What'd you say about me?
I'm not sure--
Will, our offer starts you at eighty- four thousand a year, plus benefits.
I don't think I...Larry?
How'd you like that course?
I'm trying to find the name of a student who works here.
Yes. Under two conditions.
If I agree to this, I walk right now?
That would be a monumental waste of time, wouldn't it, Will?
--That edge!
--This can't be right.  This is going to be very embarrassing. Have you ever considered--
It's right.  Take it home with you.
I couldn't go 'cause I had a date. So I sent my cheif negotiator.
Then don't set up any more meetings.
Thank you.
So who won the bet?
You were missed.  How long has it been since we've seen each other?
Would you excuse us?
Jobs doing what?
Sean, this is important. And it's above personal rivalry--
--Ready to falsify documents because you've given him license to walk away from this.
What problems does he have, Sean, that he is better off as a janitor or in jail or hanging around with--
Oh, that's nice--
Yes you do. You're angry at me for doing what you could have done. Ask yourself if you want Will to feel that way for the rest of his life, to feel like a failure.
So I hear you're taking some time.
That's why I love stock-car racin'. That Dale Ernhart's real good.
No, but, I mean you know...I do other things. That no one knows about.
I'm not here for a fuckin' book report. They're your books, why don't you read 'em?
Sure, how 'bout "still waters run deep"--
Maybe you should be a patient and sit down.
Watch your mouth.
Why thank you.
Yeah? You got a lady now?
Jesus Christ, you are an amateur.
So Christ, call her up.
My wife's dead.
Well, I've read you colleagues. Your book was good, Sean.  All those guys were in your platoon?
What happened to that guy from Kentucky?
You don't regret meetin' your wife?
Do you think you're alone?
Do you have a soul-mate?
Don't give me you line of shit.
It's not about that job. I'm not saying you should work for the government. But, you could do anything you want. And there are people who work their whole lives layin' brick so their kids have a chance at the kind of opportunity you have. What do you want to do?
Nobody gets what they ask for, Will. That's a cop-out.
Well, I'm here.  So, is that my problem? I'm afraid of being abandoned? That was easy.
Yes.
I know.
I know.
That's what you want?
I just want you to know, Sean...
I'll keep in touch.
See ya.
Skylar. And by the way. That guy over there is a real dick and I just wanted you to know he didn't come with us.
Great, or maybe we could go somewhere and just eat a bunch of caramels.
Yeah?
Sounds good, where are you now?
Now, I'm gonna make all these caramels disappear.
Have you ever seen Annie Hall?
No I wasn't...
Free?
Yup, you're lookin' at lucky thirteen.
I swear to God.
Marky, Ricky, Danny, Terry, Mikey, Davey, Timmy, Tommy, Joey, Robby, Johnny, and Brian.
Didn't your mother ever tell you not to look a gift horse n the mouth?
I thought you said you'd show me your place.
Have you ever studied Organic Chemistry?
Why won't you come with me? What are you so scared of?
Ready, Pa?
Go on. Get in your tent. You don't know nothin'.
Lissen. I don't care nothin' about you, but if you mess in this, your whole fambly li'ble to get in trouble, an' Tom get sent back to the penitentiary.
Ready, Ma?
Maybe. Maybe twenny days work, maybe *no* days work. We ain't got it till we get it.
Woman can change better'n a man. Man lives in jerks--baby born, or somebody dies, that's a jerk--gets a farm, or loses one, an' that's a jerk. With a woman it's all one flow, like a stream, little eddies, little waterfalls, but the river it goes right on. Woman looks at it like that.
You bust outa jail, Tom?
Think I'll look aroun' an' see if I can't meet me a girl.
Short fella. Pale face.
I didn't see nothin'.
Want to work?
That's not your affair. Name.
How many men?
Can all of you work?
That's the way it is.
*Used* to be. Not no more. I lost the call.  But boy, I sure *used* to have it! I'd get an irrigation ditch so squirmin' full of repented sinners I pretty near *drowned* half of 'em!  But not no more. I lost the sperit.
Been out travelin' around?
Excuse me for asking.
I don't expeck we can las' much longer-- some a the folks ain't et for two days. You goin' back tonight?
Have it your own way, son, but just as sure as you touch my house with that cat I'm gonna blow you plumb to kingdom come.
Get to what?
You people got a lotta nerve.
Sure, plenty, but not in no wreck like this.
You know what I al'ays said: "Tom'll come bustin' outa that jail like a bull through a corral fence." Can't keep no Joad in jail!
Ma. Pa.  Grampa, his eyes hurt and hunted and frightened and bewildered, scratches in the dirt.
Well, you just turn around and walk the other way.
But will it--hurt the baby?
Anybody ask anything?
How 'bout it?
That!
Make her easy, John. Watch her.
Maybe, but we shore takin' a beatin'.
I was so scared we was goin' away without you--and we'd never see each other again.
How about it, Ma?
Was Granma bad?
Fust thing I'll get is coffee, cause ever'body been wantin' that, an' then some flour an' bakin' powder an' meat. Better not get no side- meat right off. Save that for later. Maybe Sat'dy. Got to get some soap too. An' milk. Rosasharn's got to have some milk.
You know what I been thinkin' about, Ma? About Casy. About what he said, what he done, an' about how he died. An' I remember all of it.
No, Ma. Not that. That ain't it. But long as I'm a outlaw, anyways, maybe I can do sump'n. Maybe I can jus' fin' out sump'n. Jus' scrounge aroun' an' try to fin' out what it is that's wrong, an then see if they ain't sump'n could be done about it.  But I ain't thought it out clear, Ma. I can't. I don't know enough.
This ain't a groc'ry store. We got bread to make san'widges with.
You can have this for ten cents.
Which ones?
They gone.
Gone--  --over to your Uncle John's. The whole crowd of 'em, two weeks ago. But they can't stay there either, because John's got *his* notice to get off.
Ever'body got to get off. Ever'body leavin', goin' to California. My folks, your folks, ever'body's folks.  Ever'body but me. I ain't gettin' off.
Listen!  That's them! Them lights! Come on, we got to hide out!
Fact of the matter, Muley, after what them dusters done to the land, the tenant system don't work no more. It don't even break even, much less show a profit. One man on a tractor can handle twelve or fourteen of these places. You just pay him a wage and take *all* the crop.
Who's the Shawnee Land and Cattle Comp'ny?
That's Connie Rivers with her. They're married now.  She's due about three-four months.
I figger best we leave something like this on him, lest somebody dig him up and make out he been kilt.  Lotta times looks like the gov'ment got more interest in a dead man than a live one.
But what about this?
Git up. I got sump'n to show you.
What's this?
But wait. I still don't understand what you do.
You're so funny...
Marty, you haven't changed a bit!
Yeah... Hey, I saw you at your dad's dealership the other day.
I'd come to the realization that everything I'd based my life on was false. And that my life had no meaning.
More like what happened? What happened, Mr. Blank?
--Torn down in the name of convenience--
That's part of it.
I'm sure you've done worthwhile things in the last ten years. You've had experiences.
Yes.
Seven it is.
Are you there?
Which would you rather...?
Soft. I'll take the junkie otter, clearly! I'd let the little beast scratch and claw all he wants... Okay. Would you rather make love to the candied corpse of Phyllis Diller--
It's just a game...! Alright. Candied Diller, or... wear a hot pork vest across the desert with a fully digested crab apple in your mouth?
Not the other way around...?
What if I come back?
Why don't you want to go to your high school reunion?
You needn't be so frank with me about your work.
You know where I live?
If I show up at your door, chances are you did something to bring me there. I don't care about that stuff, anyway.
How was your day, today, sir?
Like a union?
Thank you, no.
But since we're both here, I think it's time to take a fresh look at our relationship.
No deal.
It's okay. It's Martin The door begins to open revealing Debi and Newberry.
The more things change, the more they Goddamned well stay the same.
Lisbon?
Well?
Why don't we just do his job then, so we can do our job, and get the fuck out of here.
So if we do his job, we're the bad guys. If we do our job, we're the good guys.
He's falling for her. Look at him.
Did you see Blank in there?
Throw that away.
Don't tease me. You know what I do for a living.
In Detroit. This weekend.
What's it look like?
You have.
I'll call them and tell them you're taking your time. Being a professional.
I bought a new rug.
Of course you will.
Take care of her. She's a keeper.
And a leader. Didn't she meet Castro on foreign exchange?
So what happened to you?
God it's great to see you.
No. You drove us here.
What the hell happened to you?
When you see Debi, tell her I'm sorry.
Good evening, Mr. Newberry.
How are you? How's business?
I took the other road. I'm more of a self-reflective young lion who does business with lead-pipe cruelty and goes home to drink light beer in milky-eyes isolation. I love sports and sex and have no real relationships with anyone. And you?
Well... yes... I had a trailer. It's not like I made him run along side of the car.
That's your cue to say you're not laughing at me.
I've decided it's impossible to properly say hello in this place without a hat.
I have a way with animals.
Is this how you're going to make me pay my phone bill?
Yeah.
How long did you live here with your wife?
I hear that! See, I knew she was never going to be a ranchest, but I wanted to try -- I thought maybe she'd give music lessons to the kids in town or at the school, maybe even recitals. My son would grow up here. Maybe have one or two more. I'd teach 'em what I could. They'd play with my brother's kids. All grow up together. And even if they all decided to go out into the world, they'd always know where home was -- cause we'd keep it for 'em...
Yeah, I think it is. And I don't mean everybody's got to be married, have kids -- It's more like, knowing where you're from, where you belong, what feeds you, where you can go no matter what happens... Knowing what you're supposed to be doing while you're here.
Now, listen. I want you to stand on him.
Show me again.
Grace, listen to me. Your body is just healing. You have to give the rest of you time as well...
Well... how you feel all right about telling Liz to put him down...
What?
Did he tell you that?
That's not true!
Gee, this looks like a fun place.
Honey, nobody's trying to cure you --
What are you talking about?
Well, then I do apologize... But what I'm most sorry for is turning you into a spoiled brat who can only think about what she's feeling... who can't admit when she's wrong and who can't forgive when she's not.
Started what?
I'm sorry... about what I said. It's just that -- all those times you and Daddy were trying for another kid, I... I used to pray at night that it would work. And not because of you guys or that I wanted a brother or sister... but... just so I wouldn't have to be...
Smokey told me he left last night to look at some horses in Sheriden. He won't be back for three days. I can't believe he didn't want to say goodbye.
So, what, uh, what train are you taking?
I'm sorry about last night. I shouldn't have brought it up over the phone.
What about Grace?
... And uh... Mario called about moving the wisteria?
Aw... that's so sweet.
You've already made arrangements!?
Her psychiatrist... said... she needs security now... stability...
I really wish I could understand why you think this is so necessary.
What if she doesn't want to go?
So, how are you doing in Marlboro country? Is the magazine complaining at all?
Small bed. Maybe I should sleep in the barn.
I apologize for the surprise, but the days only opened yesterday and I figured...
You were right about coming here. I'm sorry for not thinking...
Was the trip okay?
I have so much to tell you.
Where does this go, Diane?
Ha, she loves telling this story about how when he was two years old, he ran off. They found him in the barn, sleeping between two giant hooves of a Percheron stallion. She said that horse was protecting him and nobody could convince her otherwise.
But, uh, Egypt is, well, it's like nothing else. It's like going back in time.  I remember as a kid trying to imagine what a kid my age, centuries ago, walking over that same ground, was wondering about or, if they had the same problems as me... and I felt, connected to... to time itself, almost. Ha, I never realized how hard it was to describe.
Did you always know this was the life you wanted?
Sounds like something Tom would say.
It's just one night. If I get uncomfortable, I'll go over to Hanks.
Maybe we should give him another sedative.
Mixed salad.
Ha...
He says if you do it soon as they're born, it makes them real easy to handle later on.
Teacher asked me why we raise Black Angus-Herefords 'stead of Pure Herefords.
Tom?
They don't get burned by the sun bouncing off the snow. And they're good mother.
It'd be a whole lot easier to pay the feed end of the month...
Don't you go to school?
You wouldn't want to dance with me, would you?
I wouldn't let happen.
What does she do?
Grace, I need you to come with me.
He's not hurt. He's okay. Look at him.
Do you want to go around by the old road?
Dad! I can do it, OK?!
Do you want something else, honey? We order something else?
You want to watch some television?
Did you notice -- no cane?
Is the poverty worse, now, you think?
Cool?
You think it's cool?
And never again have to pay for a service that would be dirt cheap...
Let's keep her.
Hold on a second!
What are you, stoned or stupid? You don't hack a bank across state lines from your house, you'll get nailed by the FBI. Where are your brains, in your ass? Don't you know anything?
You're psyched. You need to lay off of that shit.
I want it to have my children!
Oh wow, we are fried.
You heard of a hacker called Acid Burn? You know who he is?
How was school?
Talk to me.
That's Razor and Blade.
Here's your class.
What the hell is going on?
Yeah. It's not just the chip, it has a PCI bus. But you knew that.
And you have to smile.
Kate, listen.
Whoever wrote this needs somebody to take the fall. And that's Phreak, and that's Joey, and that's us. We've got to get the rest of the file, so we can find out where the money is going before the worm disappears, so we can find out WHO created it.
Are you crazy? What are you doing?
Dade.
I can't believe they decided you won.
Uhhmmm... uh gee, uh...
So, um, what's your interest in Kate Libby, eh? Academic? Purely sexual?
Good.
There's a new virus in the database.
Uh, Mr. The Plague, uh, something weird's happening on the net.
Never fear. I is here.
We have a Zero Bug attacking all the login and overlay files.
What? whatwhatwhat?
Big deal. A garbage file's got shit in it, Joey, come on.
Any questions?
Good morning, Gentlemen. Please be seated. I see we're still dressing in the dark, Eugene.
A hacker planted the virus.
What?
They had a large chunk of the garbage file? How much do they know?
Hello, operator services.
What?
So?
Can I come over after Jamie's asleep?
Rachel, I've got an expl-- I've got an explanation.
Brady!
Shit!
When did this happen?
It's hard to tell, there all chewed up.
I've seen bodies thrown 50-60 feet from a crash site.
Oh dear God. Its all right...a bad dream, just a nasty old dream.
Why wasn't I notified?
Four plus Myers.
Now where are you going?
I'd assumed Dr. Loomis would be here.  Michael Myers was his patient.
Night Doc.
Like the last time? How many people killed back then? How many kids?
Okay everybody, listen up. I've got Rachel Corruthers and her sister in the truck, and I'm taking them outta town route 410. State police are on the way. Got that?
Kido. It's four in the morning.
Sure it is. I think tonight Brady was ready to make a commitment.  But now my future relationship, my engagement, my marriage, my children, your grandchildren, have all been wiped out because I have to baby sit tonight.
I wanna go trick-or-treating like the other kids.
The Discount Mart. Can we get Ice Cream after?
Come on Rachel.
Can we go home soon Rachel?
I'm gonna lower you to the chimney, okay Jamie?
What are you doing out here alone?
We'll hear sirens soon.
You remember Lindsay don't you?
Hell of a night.
Making sure that no one can get in here.
Now I pad locked the back door, this is the only way in and out of this house. You got that?
Its true, Sheriff.
When he makes that call.
Something?
Oh Christ. Doc...
How can a man do this Loomis? Tell me.
What is he? Tell me! What the hell are we dealing with?
Where's that Deputy?
Where's the radio?
Loomis. Haddonfield.
Rachel, Jamie. Thank God!
Okay.
Why didn't you wait for me?
Come on, Annie. Bob and I have been planning on it all week.
Why didn't you say anything? You scared me to death.
I thought it was an obscene phone call.
What's the pumpkin for?
Lindsey, Lester's barking again and getting on my nerves again.
Is that all you say?
We're all alone, aren't we?
I gotta go.
A man wouldn't do that...
Is Annie around?
Okay. Later.
Lonnie Elam said never to go up there. Lonnie Elam said that's a haunted house. He said real awful stuff happened there once.
Richie said he was coming after me tonight.
No...
Right.
Promise?
Tommy, I want you to go back upstairs...
Be quiet! Get Lindsey and get into the bedroom and lock the door!
DO WHAT I SAY! NOW!
Are you sure?
I'm scared!
Now, I want you to walk to the door, down the stairs and right out the front door.
Hello.
I'm not responsible, Sam.
He was your patient, Doctor. If the precautions weren't sufficient, you should have notified...
If you say so.
It means... I see.
I couldn't if I tried.
Pull up to the entrance!
I don't think this is any time to be funny...
Oh, good...
We need more bread and some baked lasa--  uh, lasagne.  Hi.
And the quail is responsible for the quail eggs.
I know.  It's terrible!
No, really, I really like him a lot.
Wow, it's the red one?
It's French, though.  It really is.
Well, wait.  You know what?  I know.
Yeah, we have Mr. Morris Levine's eightieth birthday party on Riverside Drive...or Riverside Memorial Chapel, depending on his health.
I, uh, I'm very surprised.
I can't resist.
Here, I stole you a couple of extra clams.
You're Holly.
Oh, what, what do you do?
Yeah.
We could...we could do that.
Well, this guy's the real hypochondriac of the family.  I mean, he's, you know, he's--
I always, I-I always imagine that I have things.
How ya doin', man?
Yeah.  Some of them...yeah, some of them are very big.
Yes, but you name names.
Really?  So, so, what else?  Wh- what are you up to?
Yeah.
Hi.
Where are you headed?
Yeah, you would.
Oh, book?  Oh, no, I...  I'm killing time.  I...I-I just, uh, w-want to browse, uh...
No!  No...
Uh, yes!
Yes.
Uh...did you ever get around to e.e. cummings?
They have a very large gay clientele, you know, where I get my teeth cleaned, and...all the hygienists now wear gloves because they're afraid of AIDS.
Oh!
I-I, I'm sorry.  I know it's terrible.
O-o-o-okay, Lee.  Okay, okay.  You, you, y-you've said enough.  It's my responsibility now.  I will work things out.
Your guilt is because you feel the same.
I thought you weren't coming.
Lee... uh...
I-I couldn't think where to invite you without taking risks.
Is something wrong?
But it hasn't been forever. 
Your sister is an unbelievable cook.
You bet.
Yes, you were.  A-and when I, when I brought up the idea of having a baby, you just, you jumped down my throat.
Oh, let's not--I, I don't know what the hell I'm talking about.
I didn't say that.
Well, what?  What, wh-what are you not telling me?
I'm not accusing.  I'm asking.  Do you...do you find me too...too giving?  Too-too-too competent?  Too-too, I don't know, disgustingly perfect or something?
Well, what is it then?  What?  Eh, what's come between us?  How have I alienated you?
Hi.  How's she doing?
Hi, Mom.  How you doing?  Here, let me get you some coffee.  That's enough of that.  What triggered it?
But why?  We raised you as a Jew.
Why should I be afraid?
Of what?  I'll be unconscious.
God!  And why didn't you come tonight? We all had a terrific time.  I really think you would have enjoyed yourself.
You're not going to abuse them. They're all so sweet.
What are you going to use for money?!
Oh...Lee, you are my whole world.  Good God!  Have you been kissed tonight?!
But you, God, you knew that was going to happen sooner or later.  I can't live like this!
What's the difference?!  It's just somebody I met!
It doesn't make a difference!  I have to move out!
Oh, God, that's too much responsibility for me.  It's not fair!  I want a less complicated life, Frederick.  I want a husband, maybe even a child before it's too late.
Oh, God, I don't even know what I want.
Mickey, Mickey, listen, listen.
N-n-no, not that.
Two months ago, you thought you had a malignant melanoma.
Eh, you were miserable this morning! We got bad reviews, terrible ratings, the sponsors are furious...
Yeah.  What?
...you know it, it just takes the pleasure out of everything.  I mean, you're gonna die, I'm gonna die, the audience is gonna die, the network's gonna-- The sponsor. Everything!
Oh, great.
I'm okay.
I've been trying to talk to him about it.  He says everything's fine, but I don't know. Automatically, you know, I leap to the worst conclusions.
Yeah?
Hey, Hannah, did you read that last thing Holly wrote?  It was great. She's really developed.
How is everything?
Oh!
That's really nice!
Go right over there.
This is the second opinion.
Um, I-I didn't really want to, you know, go to a sperm bank or something, have some anonymous donor.  I-I just, you know, I-I-I wouldn't want that.
I just had a lot of luck...from my first show, you know?  I've always thought Lee was the one destined for great things.
No, Holly's game for anything. Holly takes after me.
Holly, please.  Don't insult me.
I know.  H-how much do you need?
Uh-huh.
Okay.
Ohh?
Ouch!
I've got a singing audition for a Broadway musical.  Of course, I'll never get it.
Well, you think everybody in m- musicals sings so well?
Hey, hi!
Oh, God...
Well, that...th-that's fine.
What's the matter with you, Lee? Why are you so sensitive all of a sudden?
Listen, you are witnessing genius!
Oh, look, I'm sorry it didn't work out.
God!
Yes, you do recall, right?
...and I thought I'd come in and...and we could replay, uh, the whole, uh...
Well...
Yeah?  Is that an embarrassing question?  Should I have not asked it?
No, you can tell me.
This is it.  Yeah.  This is really-- HOLLY  Well, wo-would you be willing to-to read it?  Something...that I wrote?
Oh, well, God, I can imagine what you wrote.
Oh!
Tch.
Dad...
Hi.
Oh, please!  We all came to have lunch, didn't we?
Boy...Holly...Holly.
Uh-huh.
Aren't you glad to see me?
...you haven't <u>found</u> him yet.
...and I want to talk to you about your <u>promotion</u>..
Would you mind saying that into your bag...?
I would have figured you an R.N. by now, or, maybe Med School.
...why?
We could skip the Gavotte.
Lechter's not buying up his Memorabilia. He keeps it all in his "mind," do you see...?
<u>Who</u> are these guys...?
And why is it a vacant exercise?
Who would that be.
C'mon, pal.
You're ready now.
...they're sending me.  Out to get Shot.  Hounding me.... they're... 
How you doin?
What, What, I can't hear you...
Who, can you think, who would want to harm Dr. Fanelli, did he have any <u>enemies</u>, that...
How was America?
The identity of the person offering the bounty was never established.
...WHY DID HE COME BACK?  WHY DID THE BOY TURN BACK...?
Where was the call from.
Make plans for Lechter's abduction.
He escaped...
He don't like popcorn.
I like Popcorn...
What would <u>that</u> be?
He is...?
No, no, of course not.
Oh, yes, what?  You'd <u>bribe</u> me, to, to, to, "release" you...?
A fellow with five fingers.
Not for our Doctor Lechter.  This...  Purports to be an x-ray of the hand of a ...white male...mmmm....mmmm...., after the removal of a vestigial sixth digit. Left Hand.  It purports to be the x-ray of Dr. L...
Just a moment.  Starling didn't...
I had... one moment, I had an <u>agent</u> in there, waiting for <u>backup</u> from...
Your girl's a menace.  Here, givver <u>this</u>... Getter off the street and teach her some <u>humility</u>. 
Sadly, no.  And I find that birth is one of the few things in life which study and a pleasant attitude can not amend. What do you think?
You know it?
...yes.
My scar is a war-wound.
And?  Then?
I've left my <u>program</u>...
I require...
In and out.  Yes.  And Mama... and Mama, is not your real Mama, is she Franklin?
Do you like it at your home, Franklin?
You find something objectionable to working in partnership with....
You were given backup....
You don't wish to <u>beg</u>...?
...which of us is free...?
You should get Married.
Yeah, well, they solved that:  turns out, he'uz a <u>cannibal</u>...
Yeah.  Well.  They're a talkative buncha commentators.
Trouble is, they all seem to <u>die</u>.
What would you guess, Ardelia?
Don't shoot yourself.
...why are we here in the <u>first</u> place...?
No.  Invite us?  No, he simply...
Because...?
"Because we don't have any money."
Ask me when we get home.
...what a lovely perfume.
She must be something special After Dark.
Tell me why...?
Your father.  It is not <u>they</u>, who...
And you have decided to accept... to accept this "emotion," as you put it, to the ... the "sweepings. of the Lechter case.
You want some <u>advice</u>.
Your life has been defined by institutions.  The Orphanage where you were raised, the FBI Academy, the Bureau.  If the Institution is your life, <u>accept</u> it.  Ask to be reinstated on the "Drumgo" task force.  Play their game.
For the <u>worst</u> hurt, of course, that which will not heal, is the conviction no one cares.
My encounter.
Howdy Pouty.
I'm in the picture on Wendy's wall. Niagara Falls. Family trip. Little Wendy foreground. Me background. What are the odds on that one?
You know, I think I left something by the lake. Could you check it out-- You'll know it when you see it...
I guess it was too much to ask that it would somebody older...and maler. Like you.
Goodnight, Jasper.
What are you doing?
...sorry...
Well, the first week of camp has swhooshed on by and I thought this a perfect time to finally pow-wow. I think we should discuss--
Who wants to go tell the Anti-christ to take a "time-out?"
College was entertaining, Wichita, but after 40 days and 40 nights of this, I really think we're going to get to know each...
...and it hurts too much to keep these feelings inside me any longer...
Stop, stop, what was I thinking...out in the wilderness.  Under the stars. I've ruined every--
Isn't this the time where one of us says something deeply offensive to the other one...We're just so different.
Todd was out there blocking the                             ] entrance. You would have been proud                         ] of me...My suit of armor is starting to come off. Not all of it, but enough to walk around...
Are you allowed to do it more than once a night?
Do you really think we're fooling anyone?
Ah, our last night at camp...I always knew it would be something special.
How's my little cheerleader? Now I know everyone at your high school isn't so uptight, come <u>on</u>.
I don't know. This thing leaves a bad taste in my mouth.
Take a break Veronica, sit down.
Goddamn. Will somebody please tell me why I read this spy crap.
Hey Veronica, how'd that Teenage Prevention T.V. Suicide thing go?
Come on Heather. We want another look at today's lunch.
J.D.? You seem pretty amused. I thought you were giving up on high school guys.
Crap. So who's this Brad guy I've been set up with? Witty and urbane pre-lawyer or albino accountant?
What's your damage? Brad says you're being a real cooze.
You stupid cunt!
You were nothing before you met me! You were playing Barbies with Betty Finn! You were a Brownie, you were a Bluebird, you were a Girl Scout Cookie! I got you into a Remington Party! What's my thanks? It's on the hallway carpet. I get paid in puke!
Veronica. And Jesse James. Quelle surprise. Hear about Veronica's affection for regurgitation?
Maybe you should see a doctor.
Don't worry. We'll work something out.
Hi everyone, door was open. Veronica, you missed it! Pauline and Whitney James were up there doing there suicide rap when the cops come in and announce that Martha Dumptruck tried to buy the farm. She gave the ticket girl at the Colfax theatre a suicide note then bellyflopped in front of a car.
It was J.D.'s idea! He made out the signature sheet and everything. Now will you sign it?
What's your damage, Heather? You ruined my...
No way, no day!
Watch it, Heather. You could actually be digesting food.
Ram asked me out, but he wants to double with Kurt and Kurt doesn't have a date.
Probably just row on out to the middle of a lake. Bring along my sax, some tequila, and some Bach.
You going to pull a Big Gulp with that?
The extreme always makes an impression, but you're right, it was severe. Did you say a Cherry or Coke Slurpee?
Just a humble perk from my Dad's Construction company or should I say Deconstruction company?
Everybody's life's got static. Is your life perfect?
Now blah-blah-blah is all I do. I use my grand I.Q. to figure out what gloss to wear and how to hit three keggers before curfew. Some genius.
Hey, it was good for me too, Sparky.
O-kay. We'll cook up some soup and put it in a Coke. Sick, eh? Now should it be Chicken-Noodle or Bean-with-Bacon?
Milk and orange juice. Hmmmm. Maybe we could cough a phlegm globber in it or something.
"You might think what I've done is shocking..."
That's good, but Heather would never use the word "myriad."
She missed "myriad" on a vocab test two weeks ago, all right?
Perrier water!
Did you miss him completely?
You shoulda stuck around, jerk. Ms. Fleming wants to redefine the high school experience.
You can be so immature!
Catch a movie? Miniature Golf?
It's over, J.D.  Over!
You're still not listening! I'm not..
Okay, okay. I knew that. I knew that. Put your hands on your head.
How do you turn the fucker off?
You going to eat this?
Hey kid, isn't the prom coming up?
You two....
Veronica! J.D. told me you committed suicide last night!
I'm so sorry. I was led to believe there were going to be different kinds of social and psychological types at this gathering.
It's all yours, Heather. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go throw up.
I've never cottoned on to Plasticine like you girls, but I enjoy making things out of wood.
This story of yours-maybe the school newspaper will print it when it's finished.
Let's have 'em now, while they're fresh, eh, Nora?
and Pauline hurriedly work together, setting out plates and cutlery.
I spent a wretched night. It would be wonderful if I could get tuberculosis, too.
holds up a loaded fork. Pauline reluctantly takes it.
Can I go now?
What does old Stew want?
I'm educating myself!
You have it.
Look, Mother!
Hello!
Mummy!
What?
Let's go overseas . . .
I'm coming with you.
It's a three-act story with a tragic end.
I thought for hours about whether Carmelita should accept Bernard's marriage proposal . . .
If they're blocked memories... I'm starting to realize the reason why I blocked them out. Allison I think I really... screwed everything up.
Of course, yes.
So, I'm done. Thats it for today?
Hint. It's not a geographical location.
Yeah. It's like I was a different guy then I am today. I can't remember that guy. I see these women, they think I'm someone else, and I'm not that guy anymore. I'm not sure who Kristy knew.
No.
Why didn't you tell me sooner? I would have switched doctors!
Allison I think I did some very, very bad things. I mean very bad.
I have my connections
Hey if you're not doing anything I'd like to buy you a beer after work. Be just like old times.
I've got a better offer. More time off. A sort of career shift, more in the engineering line of work.
Yeah? You and who else?
Bret... what the fuck...?
What did you just say?
Now I want you to tell me what you remember happening- in your own words- exactly the way you told Detective Lange. But this time I want you to make one small adjustment.
What's wrong, Trev?
How does feel to be Mr. Kirsty Hughes for a whole year.
Happy Anniversary, Mrs. Gooding.
Thanks for coming down Mr. Gooding. Has your head healed okay by now?
It should all in the report. I told you guys everything. She was giving birth in the fucking car. She grabbed the wheel and I lost control.
Sorry I'm in your seat aren't I?
Sorry to take up your time like that Trevor. Don't work too hard. Oh, before I forget. I talked your neighbor out of pressing charges.
It was an analogy. Your soul is locked up inside you. You need to free it Trevor. You've blocked it from the healing process. That's what we need to do now. Heal your soul. And to do that I you have to give in utterly and without any hesitation or doubt. Do you know what I mean by giving in? It's about trust. Do you trust me implicitly?
Are you ready?
Wait... what the hell is this...
It's not that kind of date.
Tawny I think I'm going to be sick.
Hey you're the guy from down the hall.
You got a drinking problem or what?
I just wanna talk with you for a minute.  Then you can jump.  You can jump twice for all I care.
I dunno.  It was... an impulse. Me, wearing my good shoes.
Looking... good, partner.  Hang in there.
I know what he means.  I'm not a prison kinda guy, Miss O'Day.  I'm a goddamn working man for Chrissake!  Maybe I "augment" my income a little with some "business deals," maybe summa the guys I sell to are crooks, how would I know, I'm not an investigator.  You can't make it on a wage no more, not in this country.
He gives a good report and I walk?
Yeah, I been calling in sick.  They think I got the flu.
Often, uh.
"The Angel of Flight 104!"  You're telling me you're the A...?
Whaddaya mean they didn't reduce the bail?  If they didn't reduce it, how'dja spring me?
You whaaaaaat?  You paid it?  You gave a bondsman ten percent?
That fake <u>inspired</u> you to loan a guy who's been fired off his job <u>twenty-five hundred</u> goddamn dollars? A guy you say is probably gonna <u>do</u> <u>time</u>!  You're s'posed to be an <u>attorney</u> for Chrissake!  You're s'posed to have <u>good judgment</u>!
You got a ten year old attorney, Bernie?
I didn't even know you had a kid.
You in business with those guys or what?  I wouldn't want a problem for the establishment, Bern.
What wouldja say if I toldja I ran into a burning plane an' saved a buncha people, Chick, an' risked my goddamnlife?
Bill, I got some legal problems and I...
Bill, I got financial problems and...
He had an emergency call... a <u>real</u> emergency.
"Elliot"?  The heroic goddamn fireman?
I was giving him some advice is all. Preparing him for life.  You don't want him to grow up soft, Ev	, it's tough out there, it's a goddamn jungle.
For God's sake, tell him I'm on my way.  Let's go, Chucky.  A police escort is gonna pick us up en route.  You too, LaPlante.
What, is everybody in love with this, bozo?  I don't get this.  What about...?
Underbelly!
All this is off the record, Chucky, because if John Bubber lives, Mister LaPlante is going to give him his assurance that there will be no more "misbehavior" on his part.  What's more he's going to apologize.
I could deny I had those credit cards on the plane with me, LaPlante...
Well, maybe I wouldn't lie...but I could tell the story the way I did just now, so that people could understand that John is even more of a hero, and that you... you're the lowest thing that ever crawled.  Your name will be synonymous with cynical opportunism and blackmail.  You won't get a cent.
Listen, Mister LaPlante... uh, Bernie... Who... are... you?
This guy, this "friend" your mother's seeing, he's a fireman, huh?  He ever... spend the night, whatsisname?
It was this war.  Viet Nam.  Doesn't matter.
Uh, no.  But I, uh, wonder if you could up support... support a program to help the needy and...
It's not right, Gale...
We're gonna wait here?  The guy could be hours.
Hey, listen, great that you're a career-fiend, I got a wife and family, I...
Swiped your purse!  While he was saving you?  You gotta be kidding!
Ticket!  What's going on?
He's not <u>supposed</u> to be an actor, that's the whole point.  He's a <u>real</u> <u>life</u> <u>hero</u>, all he has to do is <u>act</u> like a real life hero.  That's the <u>beauty</u> of the <u>concept</u>, the whole <u>freshness</u> of it.  Did she call him back?
She wants to quit?
The Presidency.  The public loves him.
I haven't won it yet.  I notice you've got me scheduled on a flight back an hour after the ceremony.
Hey, Miss Gayley, there's a cop looking for you.  From Robbery Detail, Inspector Dayton.  He wants you to call him.
I didn't ask him.
Inspector Dayton, the cop from Robbery Detail who was looking for you.  They caught the guy who stole your credit cards trying to sell them and he wants...
Hey, c'mon.
Everything breaks at once.
I apologize for that scene with my husband.  You must have overheard.
It's nice that you can make that choice.
What happened?
I was thinking about our conversation the other day -- what you said about choices.
Yeah, you know, that in life you really have to choose what you want to do.
Yeah, right -- I really have to go to bed.
I found a cent!
C'mon, kids, let's go.
Whew.
Where'd he go?
Do you want me to come up and tuck you in?
Neil, calm down.
I hear what you're saying, but I know what you're thinking.
But it's what we want.
We're going to think about it.
<u>Now</u>, Neil.  Stop teasing your sister.
-- And keep my kids away from his property -- who the hell does he think he is?  Some nice neighborhood.
I know.  It's just having to pass muster with these juniors before the senior partner even agrees to see me.
Neil's still having a bad time at school.  I feel terrible seeing him so upset all the time.
Sweetheart, this is a very risky time for me right now.  Maybe you don't appreciate that.
Who told you that -- someone on the radio?
Did the cleaning woman come?
Who was that?
I was having a bad day -- I lost that job, I was dependent on other people, I was let down --
Should I come home when I'm finished there?
Just reduced.
How large is your brood?
God, your sister's really hot.
It's fun.
Dad, we can't decide unless Rudolf gets to look too!
Y'know what?  I'm ready to cancel our trip.  I really am. I've had it.
You knew a second ago.  <u>Who</u> started it?
And this -- is the master bedroom.
Even better.
What the hell.  What is this?  A joke?
Doesn't it scare you walk through the park at night?
She was a good woman.
No.  I'm telling you right now, the next person's head that comes off is gonna be yours.
Yes -- I think it is.
The prize?  So much blood so that in the end the one that remains will be mortal again.  So much pain so that the winner can grow old and have children.  The prize hardly seems worth the cost of it.
The days of magic are ending.  The world is changing.
Must you do that?
Can't you enjoy it quietly?
England.  There is nothing for me here anymore.
Thank you, Thomas.
For being a friend when I needed one. I hope our paths cross again.
That is a thought that doesn't please me.
Not long.  We should arrive in the morning.  Are you going to be alright?
Well?
You can go first.
Different places.
Then take me with you.
Why are you doing this?
Huge.
You guys are from the British museum, right?
I was wondering if I could talk to you?
No.  I'm an archaeologist.
I don't know.
Do you always walk around with a sword?
You talk to me -- but you don't answer my questions.  I guess I'll have to talk to Lieutenant Bedsoe.
No.
You're not an easy person to get to know.
That makes you uncomfortable?
Is it?
Why would someone pull on the rocks to get in the cavern?  They were wedged in tight.  They couldn't get a grip on them.  They would have had much more strength pushing on them.
I'm having some people over tonight for dinner -- I'd like you come.
It flatters me you remember, old one. It's been what... two hundred years?
Oh -- I almost forgot.  Your head.
Highlander -- I had hoped it would be you.
I am stronger than you, Highlander.
I'm glad you've come home, Conner.
Would you care for some water, Conner?
I will, Chief.  Absolutely.
You get anything on Smith?
I hate that Mickey Mouse bastard.  I hated his father, and I hate Sonny, too. Always with the tan.
I want a message sent:  No fuckups allowed.
The car.  All you want is the car?
That woman's gonna call the cops.
That's why we gotta keep going.  I'm not gonna go in for murder.
Jesus.  What is this?
There is no way out.
If we don't escape, we gotta get the word out about the cash.  That's how we'll stay alive.
All three subjects are confirmed inside. Call off the house-to-house.  Okay, Dennis, I want to explain your situation --
I'll give you these people.
You're a funny guy, Talley.
You oughta try on the problem I got in here.
Let me come get him.
If you won't let me come in, then put him outside.
You got a sniper out there, gonna shoot me?
You picked a bad house to hole up in, son.
Give up.
It ain't been a good day, Chief.
What about my father?
He has a wife and kid.  That's how we'll get to him.
Donuts here any good?
I heard he's fucked up.  They're taking him to the hospital.
I have your fucking family.  Don't forget that.
Fuck the mall.  You know that motel on the road west of town?
Take it easy.  Just take it easy.  We're here to do business.
You get the other one when I have my girls.  Not <u>talk</u> to them; <u>have</u> them.
I don't know how long I'll be stuck here.
I'm scared shitless.
I'm not gonna leave you!
Want one?
What do you want?
Smith!  Wake up!
That's enough.
That's not enough.
I couldn't find Jane.  She wasn't at the restaurant.
Did you find Jane and Mandy?
I'm Talley.  Who's in charge?
Sounds like you know the job.
They have security cameras.  Rooney would see you coming.
You want me to stick around, I could --
How about you and your sister?
I've got the boy on the phone.  He's using a cell phone.  What was that, son?  I didn't hear you.
Is my daddy okay?
I think so.
What do you want me to do?
But I might be able to sneak into the office if they're not around.  Then I could open the disks here in my room.
Where's your gun?
When this phone rings, you answer.  It will be me.  I'll tell you what to do. When I have what I want, you get your family.
No, Bik, it's a code word for Tutsis.
You work at the Hotel Diplomat?
Give me it.
Don't be foolish. There's more money to be made here.
What was the response?
Paul, you know who this is?
Paul, I've sent my soldiers to rescue the Lady Prime Minister, she'll need a room.
Hold the line here. Do not shoot! The Colonel stabilizes the situation, his men watch the militia drive by. Paul approaches Oliver
I ran out of bribes. Bizimungu took them away.
What is it?
You have cockroaches dancing on tables and you tell me the cellar is empty? Did they drink my whiskey?
You lie.
I committed no war crimes.
You will tell them the truth.
Let’s go, Jock.
Great, I really need a shower.
Get out of this room and get back to work.
Gregoire it is good to see you back to work.
Paul, how the hell are ya'?
Did you bring any of those wee girls who used to sit at the bar in the Diplomat with you? You know?
This is a Rolex, I can't take it.
You are the manager?
Excuse me.
I need you to go to this address and bring my brother-in-law and his family.
It is dangerous to be here. The radio says this is a nest of cockroaches.
Let's have dinner first.
Simon, next door, the Charingas' boy.
Why didn't you call your contacts in the army?
The president has been murdered.
Send them home. We are not the police. What do we have to protect them?
Paul, don't let them die.
What!
Any luck?
How can we help him.
Go to the roof now.
Lynch Bages, 84. Perfect with lamb, or fine rare beef.
To Rutagunda's place. It is close by.
I hear we must pay for everything. How much for this?
To be closer. So that I could marry you.
A car.
Please, please try one more time.
We are almost out of water.
Our children cannot see us die first. If the Militia comes, you must hurry up to the roof. I will meet you there.
The Diplomat! Tatiana wakens, startled.
I managed to get the President of France on the phone.
Paul, I pleaded with the president to go in and get you all. He told me it will not happen.
Rutaganda's place?
Sit up, smile, Zozo, don't attract attention to yourself.
Where's housekeeping? They won't pick up.
Why the hurry, Roger?
I'm looking for Moses Seradungu's room.
Oh, he's got no problem with that: I'm his fourth.
Convinced all those that needed convincing: you're an official dead lady.
More the merrier.
There must be some other way out.
Excuse me?
I'm sorry --
Oh, really: who?
If there really is someone else in this house, I think the four of us can handle the situation.
Yeah, what the hell, I'll go.
What's in there?
Hail Mary, full of grace -- the house is growing!
-- closed.
Is she...alright?
Three steps forward -- I want to get up there.
What are you looking for?
Don't think it's even an issue.
Better put it on hold 'til we find Pritchett.
You know how happy I'd be if that was really true, Evelyn? And how positively goddamn delirious if you weren't fucking every living thing in our area code at the same goddamn time!
Huh. And here I had a completely different theory.
Fine with me. Just somebody then better go and round up Melissa Marr.
I was in the middle of --
First time for everything.
I think you're gonna miss the bash of a lifetime --
House 2, Guests 0.
Jennifer-Jenzen-Executive-V.P.- Paragon-Pictures.
This is all maybe getting a little too strange --
Well, I don't.
I'll take my chances.
Houston, I think we may have a problem.
Oh, no.
Pritchett, this "lockdown" thing -- it's gotta have like a master control -- you know machinery, gears, whatever -- somewhere in this place?
Ghosts killed your father?
Sara...?
So many unanswered questions.  Why was she buried there.  And who killed her?
I have to admit I was skeptical.  Until now.
It looks delicious...
Are you all right?
It will heal.
May you find the peace you've sought in vain for so long.
It's going to hurt us!
My angel!
She's here.
I want this one, daddy.
What's he doing daddy?
I can't move!
Oh my God!  She's in there!
Well the realtor said that was going to be taken care of and it wasn't.  I'll have to call her.
Oh come on...
What will Aubrey think?
Are you playing tricks on me?
No.  Maybe it was Aubrey.
The heater's here.
Weird sounds, things moving, lights going off.  The videotape...
A friend?
Oh my God where is she!
Aubrey!
You know, I was thinking... All that stuff father Seamus said...about discord, distrust... we're doing all right, aren't we?  You don't have any doubts about me, do you?
Maura, what is this!
We'll destroy you...destroy all of you!
You're bleeding.
I think we should do it.
You've done your homework, Mrs. South.
Is white meat all right for you, Mr. Shea?
You must be a Londrigan.
She attended the church for years. A dear woman, it was sad to see her decline so rapidly.
Your daughter's been taken.
I'm going to need some blood.  It must be from a woman.
Now you must listen to me. This force is like a parasite, or a virus. It feeds on doubt, suspicion, discord... you must clear your mind as we reach out for her.
We must return it, if you want your daughter back.
Looks like we have some animal hairs in here.  Maybe some kind of a rodent.
What, you think I'm kidding?  I guarantee it.  An inch more flank.  Boys upstairs get hot.  Bingo, you're an anchor-woman.
Not on station time.
Hello?
It's ... I don't know.  First World War, right?
Wha .... ?
Look, lady!  I told you!  It's not my problem!  I was just there!
Sorry.  It was my father's.  It's temperamental.
But I don't know anything!  Really.  I just came out of the club and the kid was already in the street.  He ...
No.  I'd seen him in there a few times before.  He was just a punk.  I'd never like danced with him or anything. Anyway, he was a thief.  He must've taken it from the statue.
The thing!  He was lying there in the street, moaning.  But he pointed at it ... 22
Yeah!  That's what I'm saying!  And it was lying next to him.  And he pointed at it before he passed out and ...
How have you ... ?
Yeah.  I found it.  I knew held like it and I figured ...
I was downtown looking for a ... a friend.  A guy I know.  Anyway, there was this store.  Like real old?  Lotsa weird shit in there.  I saw this statue. Pillar.  Thing.  I knew he'd love it. You've seen the club.
For somebody else, alright?  Not for me. I don't do that shit anymore.
Never mind.  I'm glad it's gone.  Made the store feel strange.  Who'd make such a thing?
It was part of a job-lot.  Some loony- bin they shut down.  Unclaimed stuff.
Welcome. 38
Thank you.
It's yours.  You won it.  It's a prize.
He's a barman.  Whatever.  Do you mind if I continue?
... Let it define you.  Whatever it is. Most of the roses die behind the bar. This is the first I've given out for nearly a month.
It doesn't bother me.  I'm just not interested.
Yes.
Yeah right.  How'd you get this number?
I miss you too.
Oh, I don't ...
Yeah ... yeah, it looks different.
A girl?  Anyone I should know?
That's terrible.  What a bitch.  She was obviously just using you, Terri.  Ready to dump you the second she had what she needed, interfering little whore.
You're saying you want us to beat them to the crystal and save the world from financial disarray.
The security's actually not that severe.
Come on, Alex, let's just get to Alex's.  Your bar's the only place that's going to cheer me. God, I'd kill for a damn cappuccino.  What the hell's a Nintendo?
Those dago-guinea-I can say this shit I'm Italian-wop motherfu--
Cameras?
Did I miss anything?
The Butler did it.  Guy was a cross between Alistair Cook and a Cuisinart. Dude took Mr. Ed and humptied dumptied it over Gates's head.  He said it was made by, get this, Leonardo..
Okay, you got me, Mr. PBS.
Because I'm tired of not understanding things.  Cops, Mafia, and butlers forcing me to bust my ass to steal something, which it turns out I really didn't steal--it's fucked up.
Count of three?
"Oh, we ain't got a barrel of money.
Get 'em.  They went down the hallway.
With all due respect to that great blouse, why didn't I cut out her heart?
"Messed around" messed around?  I know-- I don't want to know.  First base?  Second Base?  Stop me when I'm getting warm...
You got it.  Operation Deflower Mayflower is a bad joke and I'm the punchline.  I thought we were using the CIA to help us to get Mayflower, but really the CIA was using me to keep us away from Mayflower.
I know, I know, your Eminence, just say "God go with me."
You're not an unmysterious thang yourself.
God, I wish I could say the same thing.  What about having a nice, dull dinner with me tonight. Scrabble, Knock-knock jokes, Anecdotes about famous dead Italians....
Catholic girls are scary...
For two years, I've been tracking the Mayflowers' peculiar interest in three Da Vinci pieces.  Their Sforza replica was as fake as the "gas leak" that supposedly destroyed it.
Where did you get this?
Hey, don't take your disguise so seriously.
Oh Hudson...
I hope you know what....
It's the site of their new museum and we're taking it over.  Operation Deflower Mayflower is going full speed ahead.
Hawk, you're a great thief.  Got set up, did some time, nothing to be ashamed of.  Don't give me a sonata about you always just really wanted to settle down, open a hardware Store and sell spatulas...
We want Da Vinci's sketchbook, what do they call it, the Codex.
I look at you Soviet people and I feel... pity... superiority.  Most of your life, your government has told you that Capitalism turns people into robots who'd rather eat microwave sushi, naked in the back of a Cadillac than hear the laughter of children.
So Hawkasaurus, I won't mince words...
Way to go, Alfie!  How many people did you break that thing in front of.   Good help's hard to find.
You wouldn't be out if it wasn't for me!  I did dog and pony for you!  You think they would have let you out after what you did, you told the board members they looked like the Three Stooges...
Guess I know who wears the penis in this family.
I hate a man with a sense of humor.  While you corn dogs were comparing the lengths of your masculinity, we obtained the helicopter the new fashioned way: a thoroughly corrupt business deal.
Except yours-yours.  The goal of world domination.  Well, if you put it that way, Minnie.  How can I resist?
You know Kaplan, if you weren't the slimiest pinata of shit that ever lived, I'd feel sorry for you.
Damnit, I hate this!  I'm a cat burglar!  Nobody said anything about this fight-to-the-death shit.
But I'm not the type of guy to hold a grudge.
Yeah, yeah. Say, you won't tell anyone about me, will you?
An' only some kind a knucklehead thinks she knows things 'bout things she, uh -- when she don't, uh -- How'd that go?
I'm telling you, Smitty, the board of Hudsucker is up to something --
-- and she's dynamite!
Yeah, and I'll bet his initials are Sidney J. Mussburger!
Hungry, anyway.
What a horrible little person.
-- these were the values that were instilled in me while I was growing up in a little town you've probably never heard of --
Oh, of all the foolish... Listen, do you take shorthand? Are you familiar with the mimeograph machine?
I'm sure I --
Well, I --
Oh, is that it!
Maybe she puts her work ahead of her personal appearance.
Sid found me the icepack.
...Huh?
Yes, you can get carrot juice or Italian coffee, and the people there -- well, none of them quite fit in. You'd love it -- why don't you come there with me -- they're having a marathon poetry reading on New Year's Eve. I go every year.
...The people look like ants.
They're going to discharge eight percent of the work force here at Hudsucker. Why, in New York alone that means eighteen hundred people out of work, people with wives and children and families --
You mean you know about this?
...I've been watching you, Norville Barnes, even though you've been trying to avoid me --
Now, Amy --
You don't know anything! Fact is they haven't bought it! The stock is cheap, Archer! What're they waiting for?
Whatever! It's no dig on you, Archer, but this story is hot and you're no longer on top of it. Why, it's the scoop of the century -- the other papers won't have the Gunderson dope 'til tomorrow -- The Allemeinischer Zeitung, Le Figaro, they'll be choking on our dust come mornin' --
You know what they're doin' now, Lou.
...It's the most beautiful t'ing I ever saw.
Oh, uh... Buzz... Is it important?
Awwww, buddy --
I'm sorry, buddy... I'm sorry...
...You don't?
Anyway. Any particular reason you didn't give him my Blue Letter? I mean, Jesus, Norman, just a dying man's last words and wishes, no big deal.
'...And so, Sid, the future does not belong to such as I -- nor even you. We have made our compromises with time. The future belongs to the young, who may more energetically wage the battle against corruption. Accordingly, in the spirit of hope, and the ringing in of the new, I hereby bequeath my entire interest in the company, and my seat on the board, to whomever is Hudsucker's most recent employee at the time of my demise. I know this will disappoint you -- you, Sid, who have served so diligently and for so long. But --'
-- So we'd gone out to the Hamptons and the garden was in positive ruins!
...education, were you?
All right, but you didn't excel in your studies...?
Not even behind your back?
You nitwit! I worked for three years on this deal!
That reminds me, Mr. Mu... uh, Sid. I never did give you that--
Finally.
Sorry I'm late, Sid. That back nine at Riverdale is really murder.
I got gas, Bennie.
...Enter the dame.
...No money.
But I'm Miss Jessica's nurse, Alma. You don't have to do that for me.
She was very sick and then she went mindless, Miss.
Times gone, Fort Holland was a fort...now, no longer.  The Holland's are a most old family, miss.  They brought the colored people to the island-- the colored folks and Ti-Misery.
Believe me, Mrs. Rand, he doesn't do this often. This is the first time I've seen him --
Why, Betsy -- we can't lose you. You mean too much to us here.
As a matter of fact, it means the sugar syrup is ready to be poured off.  You'll have to excuse me.
Perhaps you ought to get on to the mill.
But don't you have to work?
What in the world are you talking about?  Six ounces -- ?
Listen, did I tell you that story about the little mule at the plantation -- the little mule and Clement?  Let me tell you.  It's one of the funniest stories --
Don't let it bother you so, Wes.
I heard someone crying -- a woman --
I made it clear in my letter to the company.  This is not a position for a frightened girl.
That's hard to believe, after what happened last night.
Surely nurses aren't afraid of the dark?
It's always stood there, Miss Connell.  I can remember it in my grandfather's time and my father's. I'm afraid it will have to remain.
I took Mrs. Holland to the Houmfort.  I thought they might cure her.
I told you.
You think I love Jessica and want her back. It is like you to think that -- clean, decent thinking.
You can't believe that.  You don't know what viciousness it would take to drive a person mad.  You're not vicious or cruel, Paul.
I can understand that.  Everyone feels that way about someone.
Two things had happened, Mrs. Rand. One was that your daughter-in-law had been taken ill with a fever. The other thing -- completely disconnected -- was that you had wished her ill, because she had hurt your sons.
I tell you he hasn't and he wouldn't dare use it if he had.
Brilliant. Hey, you heading out a little early today?
Well, it's the funniest thing. I've been talking to some investors -- a little outside venture, you understand, between you and me -- about a scheme to manufacture a new Styrofoam packaging. Little peanut like pieces that can really keep an item free from trauma during shipping. Miraculous. Anyway, it turns out the genius behind the whole project is your neighbor, Jim Williams. How about that!
OK, OK, the defense rests.  Want another?
Then again, why should she be? I mean with us, with our...
Oh not again Elena! If we've got problems, why can't you just come out and talk about them.
What do you think?
I'm, uh, going to bed.
Oh yeah. Musk, or something. You like it?
You all right there?
Because you like it on your turkey sandwiches.
You crying?
What's for dessert?
I'm not surprised.
Oh lord. You think I'm so dense. And now you want to be seen with your dense wife at the cocktail party. You want to wear that ridiculous shirt which doesn't go with those pants at all. You want to wear that, and you want me to shake hands with your friends and make conversation and dress up in an outfit that shows a lot of cleavage and you're not going to accord me the respect of talking honestly about this... You don't really know what this feels like.
You've...
That this was going to be a key party?
Damn it, Ben --
Well it's good to see you -- we miss you around the house and all, but this St. Peter's, it's top of the line, eh?
See you.
Yeah?
Maybe it's all for the better, you know? Yesterday, at dinner, well, she hasn't said anything... has she acted funny to you, I mean, have you noticed anything?
Huh?
What are you talking about?
A prior engagement overcame me.
I'm picking up Paul at the station - want to come?
What you been up to?
... while children in Africa and Asia are napalmed and --
Your toes cold?
-- Well what am I supposed to call you?
-- What advice? You never --
Thank you Janey.
Well, I have to say I don't have much faith that my car keys are still in that bowl. Doesn't seem entirely safe, leaving your car keys around?
That's fine. I wouldn't expect you to see it any other way.
Who?
Weightless almost -- as if I were seeing my own memories of being a girl. There was something internal about it.
Oh I thought I'd steal the station wagon, drive up to a commune. Or set the house on fire. You know.
I'm thinking of going back to school.
Elena. Elena Hood, am I right?
You ask what the point is?
Waste not Master Hood -- that was $20 for the bag.
Paul, cancel your mental appointments, baby. What are you, like still stoned from last night?
How can you do that man?
Sleep all day. I mean, look, it's already getting dark outside, and you're just getting up.
You oughtta read this Hood, Nixon, our leader, all ye need know about the travails of life. Check out the Checkers speech stuff.
Huh?
Everything's gonna freeze, the big freeze.
Jesus, Jim!
Just be careful.
My what?
I'm in love with Libbets Casey.
How do you know this shit?
Mikey?
Why are you so good at math but not in English?
You have to follow me?
Wow!
I'm sorry if I got you into trouble. Maybe we don't have to, you know... unless you really want to.
May I operate your telephonic apparatus?
Her name's Libbets.
Hood residence.
All my model planes.
They were old. And they couldn't fly anyhow. I'm going to get a radio-controlled airplane at Christmas, and then I'll stuff it full of m-80s and then fly it into Mrs. Burgess's English class and blow it up.
Sandy, you scared the shit out of me.
Just thought I'd stop by.
I love you.
Good.
Will, you can't blame yourself.
I have to get back.
Who's playing?
She your only sibling?
But here's the thing.  I retraced your exact steps according to your statement. You couldn't have seen Detective Eckhart from there.  I mean, not in that fog.
It's legitimate.
What about your shoulder?
That's why I'm here.  I need to know exactly what you saw yesterday, Farrell.
I'll stick it in the evidence locker...
Good.
She wasn't happy.  I was someone to talk to.
We'll talk when we get back to Seattle.
You know my plan of action.
No way.
Fred Duggar?
I'm not expecting anyone.
Will...I...
Just stuff.  I don't fucking remember.
We were like sisters.  Knew everything about each other.
Hey...
She kept saying she was gonna get out of here.  Leave us all behind.  That <i>he</i> was going to take her!
She used some stupid code name.
Down at the station?
I suppose.
What the hell do you know?
Monstrous.
What are we?
I was waiting for you...
Claudia is dear to me. My... daughter.
A vampire with a human soul. An immortal with a mortal's passion. You are beautiful, my friend. Lestat must have wept when he made you --
I'm not your daughter.
Why always on this night?
But you're the fairest by far.
And if I cut my hair again?
You made us what we are, didn't you?
Not you my dear.
Laudanum!
You want me to be a doll forever?
Lestat. Oh, God forgive us.
It can't be -
The ship is sailing wihout us!
How do I look?
You don't remember? Or you never knew.
Or her, or her - or any of them?
They are ducklings, that will grow into swans. Whereas I must be the duckling forever.
I've seen enough of this! I loathe it!
Do you know what his soul said to me without saying a word? When he put me in that trance...
How do we seem to you? Do you think us beautiful, magical, our white skin, our fierce eyes? Drink, you ask me! Have you any idea of the thing you will become?
Don't make me, Claudia! I cannot do it!
Who the hell are you? What are you doing in my house?
You're not afraid of anything, are you?
Come, you're going to feed now.
I know. It gets cold so fast.
The trick is not to think about it. See that one? The widow St. Clair? she had that gorgeous young fop murder her husband. She's perfect for you. Go ahead.
They know about us. They see us dine on empty plates and drink from empty glasses.
Unless I make her one of us...
My God... to think you... are all I have to learn from...
Evil is a point of view. God kills, indiscriminately, and so shall we. For no creatures under God are as we are, none so like him as ourselves.
I didn't want to kill her.
You'll come home with me Louis? Fro a little while... until I am myself again.
I'm so glad you're here Louis... I've dreamed of your coming...
I didn't mean to let them do it... that Santiago, he tricked me...
You'd have to have a lot of tape for my story. I've had a very unusual life.
You followed me here, didn't you?
It's just a room...
See? I knew you were interesting. You mean this literally, I take it?
But I thought vampires didn't like the light.
How did you do that?
What can I do to put you at ease? Shall we begin like David Copperfield? I am born, I grow up. Or shall we begin when I was born to darkness, as I call it. That's really where we should start, don't you think?
Did he die in the fire?
You found nothing?
No vampires in Transylvania? No Count Dracula?
Lestat escaped the fire!
But you talk about passion, about longing, about things I'll never know in my life! It's still inside you, in every syllable you speak! And then you tell me it ends like that? Just empty?
And the child who did die?
Wait...Did you say off-season?
It sure is a beautiful old hotel.
Then I'll call the mainland for a charter.
You'll go away with you're college friends, but you won't go away with me?
Stupid. Stupid.
I don't know, man. Maybe we should keep going, find a phone --
I got work to do. Take the bake elsewhere.
That was heart attack time, Karla.
Say yes.
Remind me to study real hard so someday this is normal and all that back there is somethin' I do for a weekend once every ten years.
No way.
Karla!
Julie...
What do you mean?
I know I don't want to stay in here.
Ray...what are you doing?
You're the most beautiful woman in the bar tonight, Jules.
I'm trying. I really am...Sometimes I don't even know why I came up here in the first place.
No -- it's not that. It's...I'm just a little on edge. I'm really sorry.
What? What are you talking about? Where?
Why are you doing this to me?
Is there a problem here?
Something is gonna hit your butt if you don't quit complaining.
Oooh, the mainland --
Okay, I just didn't wanna get my hair wet.
I used to be a lifeguard...I'd hate to have to blow my whistle.
Why? He can't help us.
Well, I'm in school and --
He leave you?
There's ten people on this whole island and they're all gonna end up in this Jacuzzi with us.
I'm just saying what all of you are thinking. It's bad enough gettin' rained out without having to hold her hand the whole time.
We'll only be a second, okay?
Where is Miss Wollsten?
I took it for granted you gentlemen were refugees as are my other guests.
I'd like to, very much -- but it depends on what dispatches are waiting for me on the mainland.
If the wind shifts, if the sirocco blows -- the hot wind from the South -- all danger will be over in twenty-four hours.
I suppose you want to hear my prayer to Hermes.
I'm here. The General is here. You are not alone.
I have not been on the island in twenty years. It is changed - changed completely. Where are the graves -- the coffins?
There was some trouble here ——the villagers on the mainland —-this island was the focal point of their anger. They came here ——broke open the tombs and despoiled the graves.
I'm not sure that it is the plague.
You were singing, weren't you? A beautiful voice, Miss St. Aubyn.
I hope Mr. Jacks gets to bed in one piece.
You're not leaving tomorrow..?
Miss Wollsten shares the room with you?
You are fortunate in your father.
Cathy —- how does it feel to have a father?
I mean, does one love a father because he is good and kind -—or just because he is one's father?
I have forgotten it, dear.
I felt he did not like me.
You will not say one single word. I know your secret.
I don't want to be buried alive. If I die I want to be sure —- quite sure.
That's superstition. That's something out of old tales -- about the dead who live —- I'm talking of something else --cataleptic attacks -- apparent death that is not real.
You know that sound, Oliver?
You are a happy man Oliver. You have but one world to live in —- the world of today. I have two worlds. I have that old dark world of peasant ignorance and superstition in which I was brought up and a new world which the army gave me —— a world of mathematics, gun ranges,logistics, tactics, strategy.
There is something evil about her.
Well, at any rate, I would like to say goodbye to the girl.
Is this what you wanted to speak to me about?
Theodosia --
Oh, that Vrykolaka business. You mustn't be too angry with him, Thea. He's an old man and now with all this trouble —— the disappointment in not being able to lead his own army to victory -- cooped up here waiting for death - naturally his mind goes back to the things he believed when he was an ignorant lad in some mountain village.
But they're somebody's children.
Hey, this is the company's posters, and the company won't like this.
Come on, we got to get this up. He's coming.
Oh, I know all about you. I've watched you grow up from a little boy.
Oh, no.
What'd you say?
You have no car.
What's the matter with him. I never saw Nick act like that before.
No.
Look, I think maybe you better not mention getting your wings around here.
You see, George, you were not there to stop Gower from putting that poison into the . . .
Well then, why am I seeing all these strange things?
Clarence . . .
Where's Mary?
She's . . .
Poor George . . . Sit down.
Where? I don't see a thing.
A boy?
What's that?
Hey, Ernie!
Bert, the cop, sent this over. He said to float away to Happy Land on the bubbles.
Yeah –– yeah –– hurry up. Zuzu's sick.
Oh, Mother, Mother, please help me. Something terrible's happened to me. I don't know what it is. Something's happened to everybody. Please let me come in. Keep me here until I get over it.
Today, over at the house.
Oh, oh. Sam Wainwright! How are you? When did you get here?
So long, George. See you in the funny papers.
Goodbye, everybody!
Oh, it's wonderful.
Mr. Gower! Mr. Gower! This is George Bailey! Don't you know me?
Oh, well, you know what I've always talked about –– build things . . . design new buildings –– plan modern cities –– all that stuff I was talking about.
Yes . . . Yes . . . You're right, son.
Oh, am I glad to see you.
George.
Do me a favor, will you, George?
Well, you remember my kid sister, Mary?
Two cents worth of shoelaces?
Uh-huh. Breakfast is served; lunch is served; dinner . . .
Well, what do you know –– wife.
Old Building and Loan pal, huh . . .
Holy mackerel!
Pop!
Thank you, sir. Quite a cigar, Mr. Potter.
No, sir. No, sir. I haven't.
Oh, I don't know . . . why not right here? You remember that old tool and machinery works? You tell your father he can get that for a song. And all the labor he wants, too. Half the town was thrown out of work when they closed down.
Money? Yeah . . . well, a little.
Okay, then, I'll throw a rock at the old Granville house.
Oh, no, George, don't. It's full of romance, that old place. I'd like to live in it.
Uh-huh.
I'll take it. And then what?
Hello, Mary. I just happened to be passing by.
After that, who cares?
Just a minute, dear. Oh-oh . . .
Oh, Mary . . .
Have fun.
Is it snowing?
Oh, George, George!
Oh, Mom –– I'm chairman of the eats committee and we only need a couple of dozen.
For me...?
When do we get to the lighthouse?
Bring her to port a little.  That's it -- steady.
Same as always -- glub-glub, bubble-bubble, stroke-stroke. There sure is some weird shit on the bottom of the ocean.
Why'd they decide to move?
But we had it!  We were headed right for it!
Loser sails home alone.
I don't know.
Want to talk about it?
Sean!   Catch the rope!
I never heard of a 908.
We got a helluva tide this month.
How long ago?
I can't let you take her out.
You're too close.  Back off.
Because.
Sure, sure -- Jeff Hendricks brought in this camera, see, from underwater, and I didn't know how to get it open, but my brother-in- law, in Montauk, he works at a hi- fi store, and they sell cameras, so he....
Do you?
Carcharadon Carcharias.
What makes you think there might be?
Probably.
Remember 1959, the Jersey shore?
Sean's awake.
Mrs. Silvera?
Thank you.  I'll tell him.
Hi.  I closed a sale today, without Len.  That's $1200 commission, if the papers go through.
Stop that!  We're not going any place.  You love it here.  Tell me what the hell happened!
Are you serious?
A tragedy.  But that was a boating accident; no bites, no sharks, nothing but a boating accident.
What am I, an ass?  When you called me, I called Elkins, and her bosses. Nothing she saw is proof of anything.
Chief -- the Board of Selectmen has a question only you can answer.
Get him the hell over to Amity Point, the old lighthouse.  Right now.
Harbor Air, do you read?  Over?
Where the hell is Air One?
Some people.
Hang on!
I told you, remember?
What's wrong?
You're not going out right away, are you?
Did you ever see a dolphin?
Terry!  You okay?
Anyone know what time it is?
Take a break for a minute, okay?
Give me back my hat!
What about the others?
Mmmmmm.
Anything.  Anything.
How much longer?
What is it?
That's fun!  Let's race for some- thing!
Faster!  Faster!
I want Fruit Loops!
You're going out.
You're going sailing.
Look -- if you're going to get in the way, you can just go home.
Be reasonable, please....
Go on, you're tired.
It hasn't adjusted.
Go on, Doctor.
He's going with you, Doctor.
We're going to have to cover the entire lagoon.
Aren't you suiting up, mate?
Yeah.
Sure.  Want to try that new Italian place?
Where are you going?
How the hell did it get in here?
Wouldn't this whole thing be a little safer in the daytime?
I need more pressure in the shark tank.
Yes.  It's faster.
Calvin wants me to move the White for tomorrow.
How is he?
I am.  You're not.
Are you okay?
Nobody told me.
They're not tricks.  They're behavior patterns.
It's no use.  They won't come into the lagoon.
Like hell!
Why?
Some miss all their shots.
That's what life is, Doctor. Full of chances to hurt yourself, or somebody else.
Hello.  I think his nap's over.
Believe me, I am.
When did this happen?
I knew it;  it's my fault.  We moved it too soon.
No one's ever done it before. It was a good try...
I was seeing this guy off.  He flew in from Dallas.  Wants to marry me.  He's okay, but Texans are so possessive.
You gonna work at The Kingdom?
I'm a water-skier.
How come?
Well, I needed a cold shower.
This is where to be.  High and dry.
You're not in the water.  You're in a gondola.
Let's go, let's go!
Take it up.
Back, Kelly.  Lean back!
Bring the crane over.  Come down. Easy down.
Tradition.  Royal sense of adventure that's been in my family for centuries.  Dates back to the Crusades and King Richard.  What I was born to do.
Filter system number four.  Is it large enough?
I'll go with you.
Well, Dad asked me to ask you this, about the wedding.  Is there any chance you and Kathryn will get married in Amity?
She still talking to you?
Thea....
Daddy, why can't I...?
You said it wasn't polite to interrupt people....
What do I think?  I think it's a lovely idea....
How come it's my responsibility?
Close the door.
The doctor said she should be all right...She's in shock....
You knew...?
I could use a half-dozen more arms ...I've only got two weeks to get this thing finished....
Usually it's all he talks about...You mustn't worry....
I used to worry...But you know what happens, you find out that scuba diving's safer than climbing into the bathtub....
At least he doesn't have a beard....
Maybe he's got good taste...I don't think he's spent much time with a woman like you....
Sweet breezes...Sweet women....
I hope the man knows what he's doing....
I see what you're doing....
The fish.  Check it....
Can I ride one sometime...?
No one.  Nothing.  We've got to get this finished before the tide comes in.
What's it cost to take a ride on that plane...?
I almost forgot....
It came for him.  It waited all this time and it came for him....
It's late....
You look tired....
I want you all to come to Amity this summer.
Promise me you'll be all right....
Sometimes I think I'm going crazy. The nightmares....
It was no accident....
How can you just take the plane like this?
I'm fine.
I don't know why I fish here...Never catch anything...Must be a sign under the water...'Beware, Hoagie's here....'
You're going after her in that? You're crazy...It'll take all day in that bathtub....
What do you mean, it'll find her?
Can't this thing go any faster?
What happened?
Tricky little devils, aren't they? How's the degree doing?
The stuffing came out of the pillow he was wearing....
You moved any slower, you'd grow roots...We've got a schedule...shake it, man....
You couldn't find your ass with both hands....
I missed you, is all.  It's dull around here working alone...Smelling all that sweet cologne....
A regular tropo...Spend the rest of your life in a bathing suit, living off nickel and dime grants.  You want to be a bum all your life, be my guest.  Not me.  I'm not growing old chasing snails and dying from terminal crotch rot....
What happened to Clarence and...?
When I got the grant.....
I thought we were planning a long rosy future together.
You sure you've done this before?
And it's always worked?
How long have you known Hoagie?
Half don't...Bring her about....
It's my turn in the barrel, man....
I don't like it....
You told me what?
Holy Christ....
Wait for the sucker to charge, then hit the switch.  Just like taking a picture.
You'll never guess. Shut your eyes, Mama. Shut 'em for little Jakie. Ha. I'm gonna steal something.  Ha, ha, ha, ha. I'll give it back to you some day, too, you see if I don't. Mama, darlin', if I'm a success in this show, well, we're gonna move from here. Oh yes, we're gonna move up in the Bronx. A lot of nice green grass up there and a whole lot of people you know. There's the Ginsbergs, the Guttenbergs, and the Goldbergs. Oh, a whole lotta Bergs; I don't know 'em all. And I'm gonna buy you a nice black silk dress, Mama. You see Mrs. Friedman, the butcher's wife, she'll be jealous of you.
The van?
Be my guest. What you got?
I dunno .. Guess the dozer musta shifted him? You need some hands up here to look ..
Not today .. I'm on a diet to- day .. I'll take a diet soda ..
What time is it?
Maybe not? I'm feeling lucky ..
I haven't got it.
I had one <u>puff</u> on a <u>pipe</u>.
That's what I'm here for. I want you to come and see Citrine with me?  He's not gonna here it from me but I know he'd listen to you.
I wanna take that fucking Blind In- stitute to pieces .. Every address book, every phone call, everyone in and outta there in the last 5 years ..
I dunno, I daren't go in there - just about get her wired up, and the fucking mayor walks in - mad as hell - what are we doing fuck- ing with his staff? We should be out chasing major violators ..
Why's she blind, Bro?
Well .. I didn't know that ..
Jesus. What are you doin?
Now?
I got four points of posit- ive comparison on the cut ..
Don't underestimate me .. the Mayor's pissed - but that's nothing to do with this - sit down - How many times have you been up at that institute?
I never asked if he could "see." I just asked one or two of the stud- ents if they remembered anything?
Vehicle references.
So read it! You just hung a target around her neck!
I know what a "witness" is.
Then what are you hoping I'm gon- na do? Dissuade, or persuade you?
John? .. You never said that on the phone? .. What makes you think his name was John?
Is there anything else you can tell me? Anything about him or her? Doesn't matter how small?
Did Amber have a dog?
What color was it?
Have you been here long?
If I came to the diner with you, would you bring me back?
You just asked me to ask you questions.
Pray?
You're looking more worried now than when you "decided to stop worrying"?
Why can't I stay with you?
Why?
Don't say that. Don't you <u>dare</u> say that .. <u>I believe you</u>  ..
You got a warrant for this?
Who sought the warrant?
Interview over, Blattis ...
.. we got a body part. We don't know what it is - probably some kind of hospital debris - we're gonna try and check it out. O.K. Now you know as much as we do ..
A blind girl can just walk out of here, and you don't know who with?
Yeah, I guess I do.
What was she like?
What does that mean?
I'm not giving him <u>Pizza</u>. I haven't seem him for a year? I'm gonna cook him a dinner.
Such a shame .. She's a really sweet kid ..
Except for the hair color, she looks just like Suzanne?
I wonder what would make him do a thing like that?
Well, it worked, and I will not let you fail.  You are Jerry Ma- fuckin-guire.
I know.  Sorry I threw a scare into our lives there --
It's all about you, isn't it? Soothe me, save me, love me --
I have to finish my job --
It's not "love me."  It's not "trust my handshake."  It's make the sale. Get it signed.  There shouldn't be "confusion" about that.
No one has ever dumped me.
You hear those courtesy laughs, Jerry? There is a seething wrongness at the edges of this party.
... this is... uh... too funny...
I know who y6u are.  You're Dorothy Boyd.  You're in... wait... you're in Accounts.  You have the middle cubicle toward the back with that poster of Albert Einstein morphed onto Shaquille 0 Neal's body.
It's all going to work.
Well, good evening.
It was laziness1 my whole breakup with Avery. You know that thing you say, "it's nobody's fault." It's one of the great lies, right? Someone is always to blame -- if you go for it, go for it like you do a job, work at it --
Well -- this would be goodnight.
No.  I have to go in.  I live here.
Oh God.
It's not fair to you.  This whole --
I took advantage of you and worst of all, I'm not alone. I did this with a kid.  I was just on some ride where I thought I was in 1ove enough for both of us.  I did this.  And at least I can do something about it now.
I don't need you to "stick."
This used to be my specialty. I was good in a living room.  Send me in there, I'll do it alone. And now I just... I don't know... but on what was supposed to be the happiest night of my business life, it wasn't complete, wasn't nearly close to being in the same vicinity as complete, because I couldn't share it with you.  I couldn't hear your voice, or laugh about it with you.  I missed my wife.  We live in a cynical world, and we work in a business of tough competitors, so try not to laugh --  I love you.  You complete me.
What about medical?
He's coming over.
First you gotta tell me something.
Because I'm worried that you're putting your faith in this guy who, because of the way things are going, may not have an emotional marble in his head.
Easy, hon, I was just looking for fun details --
Matt, I came here because in all honesty your son is just another piece of cattle to SMI.  But to me --
I got it.
At last I find you.
You love me now, don't you?
What are you doing with me, Rod?
You're telling me to dance.
If you get injured, you get nothing.
Can I ask you a question totally unrelated to your career?
The kid is amazing.
You never had The Talk, did you?
Well, just stay healthy. I will show you the kwan.
Not everyone has what you have.
For loyalty, you buy a dog.  For love, you get married.
Why not --
Bobbi Fallon.  BPI.  I'm producing the Coke commercials for the playoffs.
I uh... don't think we're quite at your pitch yet.
To the pools?
I'll go back to them.
I'm sorry what I said back there.
Dooler, you know Bob Sugar.
Aw shit...the crowded restaurant... so there's no scene...
One-two-three, swing.
Hi.
And then my dad died and my mom took me to the zoo and I love the zoo. Do you hate the zoo or do you love the zoo?
I won't tell.
He should have kept his head tucked down.
Do you think it goes all the way across?
First off let me say as a dinosaur enthusiasts, Amanda and I have admired your work for years.
Amanda, Honey! Dr. Grant says it's a bad idea!
He says it's a bad idea!
How much weight have you lost?
You hate to swim.
Stop that. Dr. Grant says this is dangerous territory.
What?
What did you say!
Eric! Are you here?
We can't just stop looking. Eric and Dr. Grant are out there somewhere.
Well what?
Paul! Where is he? Can you see him?
Either that, or the government will firebomb it back to the Stone Age.
He's with a man named Ben Hildebrand.
We need to stick to the plan. Head for the coast.
Let me tell you a few things about you Dad, okay? He's very very very clever, very very brave, and he loves you ever very much.
You rented an automated litter box.
We've done cranial scans, and raptors actually had a quite sophisticated resonating chamber. I have a theory that their ability to vocalize is the key to their social intelligence. The way they can work together as a team.
Okay. Goodbye, Ellie.
Is that all it's been? I thought it was longer.
Know what this is?
We need to head for the coast.
Why?
We climb down to the barge and follow the river out to the ocean. With any luck, the Costa Rican coast guard will pick us up.
Do you have any kids?
What can I do for you, Mr. Kirby?
Hmmm.
We needed somebody who knew the lay of the land. Somebody who'd been to this island before.
Well that's good.
But alone?  We always had great success together, you and I.
Sorry.  We were saying?
Make a blind here?  Wait for the buck to return?
Is there an antidote?
Why didn't you tell us about these guys, Ian?!
What?
Oh --
Are you looking for a problem?
That was a pair bond!  A family group, even, long after that infant was nestbound!
Ian, you're not insane!  I'm so glad!
Well, I do, and she's fantastic. She'll take you to the museum, maybe to a movie if you play your cards right.  You're going to have a fantastic time.
Very hurtful.  Your mother tell you to say that?
Is that kid still bothering you?
You know, at the bus stop.  With the hair?
Well, is he?
Are you all right?!  Anything broken?
Killing lessons?  Heartwarming.
You version of it.
What?
You know how to work a radio, don't you?
No way.
Somewhere on this island, there exits the greatest predator that ever lived.  And the second greatest predator must take him down.
You remember that guy, about twenty years ago, I forget his name, but he climbed Everest without any oxygen, came down almost dead.  And they asked him, "why did you go up there to die?"  And he said "I didn't.  I went up there to live."
That's impossible, they can't have the sensory equipment to track it all the way here!
So what's your story, Nick?
Hey, I wouldn't want to spook the woolly mammoths.
-- way we could safely --
That little black line?
If we can't stay in the rex's territory, we have to move tonight.
You've got to be kidding.
Ladies and gentlemen, last shuttle to the dock leaves in approximately five minutes.  Drop what you are doing and leave now.
Visitor vehicles are on their way back to the garage.
Phones are out too.
But would we get the phones back?
Doctors, if you please - - I have to insist we get moving.
Yes, mitotic, pupils should be constricted.
Sure.  I've got a gas powered jeep.  I can drop her at the visitor's center before I make the boat with the others.
I have samples all over the kitchen. 
Once we have control again we - -
Four complete skeletons. . . . such a small area. . . the same time horizon - -
A drought.  The lake was shrinking - -
Anything else, you old fossil?
Why would they care what we think?
You've got a T-rex!?  He's got a T-rex!  A T-rex!  He said he's- -
- - a gizzard - -
Ellie, get the gun!  Try to reach the gun!
Do you see anything?
Dino droppings?
Hammond hates inspections.  They slow everything down.
Why not?
Let's get something straight, John.  This is not a weekend excursion, this is a serious investigation of the stability of the island.  Your investors, whom I represent, are deeply concerned.  Forty-eight hours from now, if they - -  - -aren't convinced.  I'm not convinced.  And I can shut you down John.
This is overwhelming, John.  Are these characters  animatronics?
And we can charge anything we want!  Two thousand a day, ten thousand a day - - people will pay it!  And then there's the merchandising - -
Because they sure don't look like birds to me.  I heard a meteor hit the earth and made like this one hundred mile crater someplace down in Mexico - -
And his book was a lot fatter than yours.
These look kind of familiar.
I'm stuck.  The seat's got my feet!
You know what this is?  It's a dinosaur egg.  The dinosaurs are breeding.
It's a bit of a climb.  You guys think you can make it?
Cloning from What?!  Loy extraction has never recreated an intact DNA strand!
Well, I didn't ask.  Why wouldn't they be?
What's to be scared about?  It's just a little hiccup in the power.
Blood temperature feels like high eighties.
What are you gonna do now if you don't have to dig of dinosaur bones any more?
Go away!
I like cows.
A load, if I may say so. of fashionable number crunching, that¹s all it is!
Alright Donald, alright, but just let him talk.  I want to hear all viewpoints.  I truly do.  I truly am.
But this is nature!  Why not give an extinct species a second chance?!  I mean, Condors. Condors are on the verge of extinction - - if I'd created a flock of them on the island, you wouldn't be saying any of this!  have anything to say at all!
You're right, John.  You're absolutely right. Everything's my problem.
We miss you.
Why are we hurrying if there's nothing wrong?
Fifty.
You tell them if they come up to seventy-five, I'll cut them in on the Crystal Lake package.
I don't think the people who live around here would like that very much...
Beautiful trees... sturdy trunks... lots of branches...  We can do some great logging up here.
Okay... well... I think it's this way...
Mister Biller?
This is Janet Davenport -- I'm the Realtor.
What's going on?
Great. Is that what you're going to say when I put you on the stand?
He wets the bed?
I don't believe it. Jason's mother died of ovarian cancer in 1969.
Oh?
Well, that's it. He'll be asleep in a few minutes, but his first REM-cycle probably won't kick in for another hour or so.  Is there a place we can get something to eat in this town?
I think I'm onto something, Joe.
Fascinating.
Tomorrow. If you can clear it with the Sheriff's department.
You know how to use one of those?
What's that?
How long will the effect last?
Ten minutes...
We're down to seven minutes.
I read the one about the penal colony.
These strange stories you write -- they come naturally, do they?
I was restoring some stones here in the upper section one day -- and I found this.
The Castle gates were blockaded in the time of the great plague -- it's an escape route.  Don't get stuck.
If I don't see you later -- go to my house and find my notebooks -- and destroy them.  All my manuscripts -- just burn them. Please.
In an organization as efficient as ours, if a document once in a great while gets lost it might never be found at all.
When I deliver a message the very act of delivering it, you might say, gives it an official stamp, and only in this way are both the sender and the receiver satisfied that it was delivered at all.
Oh, don't they?  I think you underestimate my station in this office and overrate your own.
It's what I'm paid to do.
No, sir.
I understand you fancy yourself an author.
I'm sorry, but I just wondered --
No, I don't.  I'm amazed that anyone is able to bear life with any assurance at all.
-- I don't know the Musil district.
Ah -- we're back to the "authorities" you spoke of.
I nominated you as a possible candidate.  You were Eduard's good friend.  He read me some of your work.
You think what we're doing is so wrong?  And what are you doing? Pursuing goodness?  For what?  To answer to some supreme tribunal?
I'm collecting Eduard's things. If there's anything you want, take it or I'll give it to charity.
Burgel! -- I didn't leave it with him.
Of course it could -- Burgel's been trying to get me thrown out as long as I can remember.  <u>He</u> could've killed Eduard.
That street down there -- I always used to call it the approach road for suicides.  It leads straight down to the bridge and the River.
Gabriela! -- you did get away.
Kafka -- is that your real name?
Where you've been employed for seven years.
Engaged in the manufacture and distribution of ... pills and so forth.
Would you describe your relationship with the dead man as close?
Still, we're probably closer to you at the moment than any of your fellow human beings.
-- If an obscure official up there in the distant mountains so far away from civilizing influences happens to meet with an unfortunate accident -- and should he tragically die in spite of the District Medical Officer's strenuous efforts to save him -- the firm wants to see the next of kin pacified and the disposition of the remains handled with the greatest possible ... efficiency.
It's gone out so quickly?
If it was Accounts you wanted why did you ask for Employees?
I did read that.  They gave him a posthumous medal.
This is the cross-reference of clerks who've worked on Orlac claims?
What if I petitioned one of the Directors?
Where do our records go to in the Castle?
Ludwig.
Then that's the place for us!
There's no hard feelings, Mr Denham! I just want to come to the island with you!
I thought that with your assistance we could have the premiere at the Albert Hall. We'll take out a full page ad in Variety - "The Lord Darrow Benefit screening". We'll invite the King of England - hell, we'll get the whole Royal Family along! It'd be good for them and good for us!
Am actually laying my hand on the twenty-five foot gorilla.Ladies and gentlemen! I am touching the beast!
Father!
Yeah! Life's looking pretty damn good at the moment.
Give it back!
He's gonna die! They'll kill him!
Ann ... Ann!
I tell you it doesn't exist!
There's no island there. We're wasting our time!
Did you see her?
Holy shit! Look at the size of that!
Haven't seen her - not since we got back.
Why? She's a junkie.
Sure dear, yes.
Not young; he wasn't young -- gray at the temples, he -- well actually he looked like you.
I know: it's ridiculous. But it's tearing me up and I don't know why. And look, all right, I came here didn't I? And if I have to, I'll keep coming here, the works, and talk about my mummy and my daddy and I'll even pay for it, but will you kindly for God's sakes say something?
Arlyn and Jane commited suicide. He said they commited suicide.
Why isn't he locked up?
No, you're frightened, you're pretending. Well -- Klute knows about me then. Does everybody know, can you tell me?
You said that.
You've changed your mind? You do want to play?
What did you expect? Frankie still has a good string, three girls. Figure three hundred a week from each.
About the dumper, didn't he tell you that?
Hey, but did we get to you, Klute? A little?
Ezra, I'm lots better than you're used to. Tell me -- the other night, watching me with Mr. Faber -- wasn't your tongue a little bit hanging out?
Then maybe Arlyn Page knew the Dumper too.
The next few weeks I would like to know where you are all the time.
How can you do it to yourself?
No, you can find some other way.  Explain it to me. Bree, show me any sense to --
No.  Well all right. But you want to and I want you to and we both know it and all right.
Spangler says we have a relationship.
Oh Jesus. Oh Jesus.
Oh look what he did in them.
I got a call from Ross this morning. Cable owned a plot of woodland -- he'd go there on weekends. They found Tom Grunemann's body buried there. They've notified his wife.
Well suppose I hadn't come downstairs. Would you just have folded up and sneaked away?
Look -- yes. I mean thanks, but -- don't you think we better be realistic?
Look, why should it be yes or no? Can't we keep it going and see? I mean we can keep in touch and visit each other and see. People do that, that's realistic.
You just finished telling me she had nothing to offer. Not Tom, you said, the Dumper was clearly not Tom.
You said Trask was arranging laboratory work. Police laboratory. Anything from that?
You must be discouraged.
You were hired to look for Tom, not someone.
What?
Klute, the Company's interest is Tom Grunemann. Solely and exclusively. You say you can't find Tom; all right, I'll see that you're paid off; the case is closed.
Well --
John, how are you?
It's a beautiful day in Tuscarora - I don't envy you that humidity in the city.
Would you like to know what's in it? The report.
All right. All right --  John, just sit tight will you? I'll read your report, I'll discuss it with the others. I'll be back next Thursday, we'll talk the whole thing over then. Nothing til Thursday, all right?
But if Cable killed Grunemann why would he get you hired to look for Grunemann?
Sounds to me you better shake him again. Put him in a spot he has to do something more -- but this time give him a time and a place to do it.
Well?
But what reason could he have? What possible reason?
Gov, want to leave me that one. How come he got to play with this one, anyway.
The subject got emotionallv disturbed; he just dropped out. There's thousands.
Klute knew Tom. He has a great many ideas about the case --
Mr. Kramer?
Mr. Kramer, do you ever have sex in here with anyone?
Does that distress you?
What do you have here, Billy?
That's Kim...and this one's Thelma and that's Mrs. Willewska and this is daddy and that's Batman and over there is Robin.
Oh, sure.  Here, this can be mommy.
Huh?...Oh God...What time is it?
What if she forgets?
It's just...I've been catching a lot of flack at the office...
Salisbury steak.
There, okay? Now that's just plain old hamburger.
I want my...mm...ommy...I want mmmy...mommy...
Objection.
Wow!  That's neat.   Can I sit in it?
And would you describe those years as happy?
Objection!
Objection, your honor.  The answer is, to be generous, very vague.
So do I.
Ted was a good worker.  But, ah... ... after his wife left him and he was taking care of the kid on his own, things started to change. Look, I know he had problems, I understand that.  I've got problems, everybody's got problems.  But I've got a shop to run, I can't let that kind of thing get in the way...  I guess I felt that Ted was letting his duties at home interfere with his responsibilities in the office.
Now then, Mrs. Kramer, you said you were married seven years. Is that correct?
Would you describe your husband as an alcoholic?
A heavy drinker?
Somewhere in between.
Is that...permanent?
Would you speak up, Mrs. Kramer? I couldn't hear you.
I thought you might just like to know that at five-fifteen this afternoon we were officially handed the Fire and Ice account by Revlon.
My American Express...My Bloomingdale's Credit Card... My check book--
Look, it's not your fault, okay? It's me.  It's my fault--you just married the wrong person.
I am not!  I'm a terrible mother! I'm an awful mother.  I yell at him all the time.  I have no patience.  No...No.  He's better off without me.  Ted, I've got to go...I've got to go.
Watching my son...Ted, I've been living in New York for the past two months.
I want my son.  I'm through sitting in coffee shops looking at him from across the street. I want my son.
Okay, I'm here.  Now why did you--
Okay...I think I'll go talk to my son now.  How do I look?
But...just in case...I mean, just on the off chance she doesn't. What are you going to do about the kid?
Ted, this may sound a little rough, but we've just landed the biggest account in the history of this agency, right? And now it's up to us--that's you and me --to deliver the goods.  Ted, you're my main man, and if I can't depend on you a hundred and ten percent, twenty-four hours a day, because you're worried about a kid with a runny nose--
How should I know?
So, naturally, you assume that since Joanna left, that would be a compelling point against her, right?
But it doesn't work that way. A major decision was handed down by the Appellate Court in 1969--in the case of Haskins vs. Haskins.
Now in Haskins vs. Haskins the court ruled in favor of the mother, thus establishing a precedent for awarding the child to the mother even though she previously abandoned the baby.
Yeah?
Jesus Christ.  Did you have to be so rough on her?
How often do you see Mr. Kramer and his son?
All right, Thelma, you want to know what's going on?  I'll tell you what's going on.  I'll tell you exactly what's going on.
Things? What kind of things?
Then how come she never said anything like that to me?
What are you going to do?
You're sure?
Wait a minute!  Wait a minute!
How many onions does it say to use?
D'you think you and Charley'll ever get back together again?
Thel, you ever hear from Joanna?
What d'you tell her?
Ted.
Huh.. .Hello?
You were a beautiful baby. So calm.
Then, we will begin with replacing the Tibetan flag with the flag of the Motherland.
Very complicated, Holiness. Let me tell you current news. The Chinese have launched a deceptive campaign aimed at convincing the world that Tibet belongs to China. We sent a mission to the Chinese National Conference. Our attendance was a grave mistake.
Of the Tibetan delegations sent abroad, all have been turned away.
So, we must face China and all her might alone.
I want at all costs to avoid this. Do we have news from the delegation in China?
Holiness?
May I listen to the news with you, Holiness?
In the Pacific Ocean.
The war is over. This is a time in when nations are redefining themselves.
America, we shall see.
Quite simple. Yes. Good.
It is unlikely. America, perhaps. There is great anti-communist feeling in America.
Did you ever doubt it?
Do you think I must?
He does, a little spot where the butter had been.
Yes.
The people want you made Dalai Lama.
Am I running away?
The Chinese have one goal. The complete dissolution of our nation. The destruction of our culture. There is no room for Buddha in their world. Our only hope is to fight.
If we agree that we are part of China, nothing else will matter. Not trade, not defense. We will be lost.
Hmm.
Much too young.
He just <u>appeared</u>.  You have no idea how he arrived in this lake?
Oh, my husband passed away almost two years ago.
Why are we landing?
Around here.  Yeah.
We'd only just met.
Could <u>she</u> stay, we've tentatively scheduled intercourse.
I do <u>not</u> like you.
Jesus Christ!!
I brought a pork chop, maybe we could hang it around your neck for luck.
This is a setback.
Promise you won't kill me, first.
Just spit him back out.  Some shall live, some shall die, arbitrarily, sound like any higher power we know?
Keep enough tension to hold him up, Hector, we don't know if he can swim.
The more he thrashes, the better.
I got something on the screen.
Such the flirt.
Eh.  Fuck it.
Excuse me.  One other thing, it's a <u>small</u> point, but... I have a thing about being humored, and I'm feeling humored, more by <u>him</u>, but you seemed quick to join in.
How big do the bears get?
And they're sure he didn't get tangled under the outboard somehow?
I'm not making it up.
If this is who I <u>think</u> it is.  It <u>is</u>.
Same thing from Fish And Game.
Whatever's out there <u>did</u> flip over a canoe--
Okay.  We're up at six.
Hard to believe there could be a monster under such peacefulness.
<u>Ow</u>.  Shit.
Are we crazy?
Well...
It was... something meeting you.
What's that?
You said nobody came in here!
Now I'm gonna puke.
I can't.  I'll get Hector!!
I told you.  Two days, we'd have to camp.
Are you alright?
They're coming right in.
Hi.  Listen.  Could I steal you a second?
<u>Oh</u>...  No, no, I'm not angry I'm not, I'm just thrown, I'm...  I actually have an early lunch, so...
Hey.
Sorry?
I never do field work and even if I did, <u>Maine</u>, to look at a tooth of a <u>dinosaur</u> who bit somebody, couldn't you dream up something--
<u>You</u>?
No.
Phone call, Clarice. It's God.
"Desperately random." What does he mean?
Agent Starling! Telephone!
What you're doing, Miss Starling, is coming into my hospital to conduct an interview, and refusing to share information with me. For the third time!
Your instructions are what I'm giving you now. Jack Crawford answers to the Director, and the Director answers to me. My God, Crawford's losing it...! He shouldn't even be on this, with his wife sick as she is... How the hell did you get in here, anyway? He gave you - what? Some kind of special ID? Let's have it.
Mr. Krendler... Dr. Lecter trusts me. Or at least, he used to. If I could just -
He gave us a perfectly good description, and we're on it now, so we won't be needing your little novelty act any longer - or his, either. He's under close guard at the courthouse, pending a prison transfer. The next plane, Officer.
Maybe he lives in this, this Belvedere, Ohio, too! Maybe he saw her every day, and killed her sort of spontaneously. Maybe he just meant to... give her a 7-Up and talk about the choir. But then -
But then he had to cover up, make her seem just like all the rest of them. That's what Lecter was hinting!
Okay, Miss Starling?
Excuse me, but I really do need to talk to you. This was Mrs. Lippman's house. Did you know her?
I'm investigating the death of Fredrica Bimmel. Who are you, please?
Mrs. Lippman had a son, maybe he could help you. I have his card somewhere. Do you mind stepping inside, while I looks for it?
Mr. Gordon, did you take over this place after Mrs. Lippman died?
Every word, Starling? Every gesture?
Do you recall my instructions to you, Starling? What were they?
Talk about him, Starling. Tell me what you see.
Why not?
Okay, Starling. Let's have it.
Mr. Crawford... can those cops down there handle Dr. Lecter?
Yes sir... I'll do my best.
And there's no way - no natural way - these could've wound up in the bodies?
Doctor, we have a hard problem in psychological profiling. I want to ask for your help with a questionnaire.
Jack Crawford sent a trainee to me?
I see. I myself cannot. You use Evyan skin cream, and sometimes you wear L'Air du Temps, but not today. You brought your best bag, though, didn't you?
It's much better than your shoes.
And the questionnaire...?
I would not have had that happen to you. Discourtesy is - unspeakably ugly to me.
His real name is Benjamin Raspail. A former patient of mine, whose romantic attachments ran to, shall we say, the exotic...? I didn't kill him, merely tucked him away. Very much as I found him, in that ridiculous car, in his own garage, after he's missed three appointments. You'd have him under "Missing Person" - which, in poor Raspail's case, could hardly be more true.
Do you have something you use, when you need to get up your courage? Memories, tableaux... scenes from your early life?
She had an insect deliberately inserted in her throat. That hasn't been made public yet. We don't know what is means.
Quid pro quo, Doctor.
No...! Quid pro quo, Doctor.
No. It's your turn to tell me, Clarice. You don't have any more vacations to sell, on Anthrax Island. Why did you run away from that ranch?
I'll listen now. After your father's murder, you were orphaned. You were ten years old. You went to live with cousins, on a sheep and horse ranch in Montana. And - ?
What did you do?
I didn't get more than a few miles before the sheriff's car found me. The rancher was so angry he sent me to live at the Lutheran orphanage in Bozeman. I never saw the ranch again...
Do you think if you saved Catherine, you could make them stop...? Do you think, if Catherine lives, you won't wake up in the dark, ever again, to the screaming of the lambs? Do you...?
Starling.
I have no plans to call on you, Clarice, the world being more interesting with you in it. Be sure you extend me the same courtesy.
Examination and interview materials are confidential. We've never violated an applicant's trust, and we never will.
Oh, that's clever, Dr. Danielson. Very humorous. You like the truth? Try this.  He kidnaps young women and kills them and rips their skin off. We don't want him to do that anymore. If you don't help me, just as fast as you can, then the Justice Department is going to ask publicly for a court order, We'll ask twice a day, just in time for the morning and evening news. And each one of our press conferences will focus on Dr. Danielson, over at Johns Hopkins, and how we're still hoping for his cooperation. And every time there's any news on the case - when Catherine Martin floats, when the next one floats, and the next one - why, we'll just issue another press release about good ol' Dr. Danielson, over at Johns Hopkins - complete with all his humorous fucking remarks.
Yes... I did.
Of course it counts. How do you play?
Your West Virginia specimen gave us quite a bit of trouble, but I finally managed to narrow his species through chaetaxy - studying the skin.
Yes, miss.
He did?
What?!
What is it?
Listen. Submit. You hear me?  You're strong. You stay alive. I will find you...  no matter how far, how long it takes...
Will you go back to England?
Where will we go?
Told you to stay away from this hell hole!  Why did you disobey me?
What?
You do not know what you are saying!
I'm embarrassed to be so indecisive... after so long apart and after you've traveled so far...
Your wounded should try walkin' back to Albany.  They'll never make a passage north.
How far is it, scout?
What?!
Then you're assigned to Fort William Henry?
And if English law cannot be trusted, maybe these people would do better makin' a peace with the French!
How long?
Where do we go from here?
And if we're unlucky?
You do what you want with your own scalp.  Do not be tellin' us what to do with ours.
Got a reason to stay.
The Crown "negotiating" the terms of service?
I have lived to see two things I never expected.  An Englishman afraid to support a friend. And a Frenchman too honest to profit by that advantage.
Shoulder arms!  Present! 
We must... stop... soon. Women are... tired.  You... understand?
No. Stop in the glade just ahead! When the ladies are rested, we will proceed. Do you understand?
If Magua give women to Yengeese soldiers... will receive many gifts.
Gold could be arranged.
What is enough?
Where is that sun?! It has gone behind the hill.  It is dark and cold. It has set on his people, they are fooled and kill all the animals and sell all of their lands to enrich the European masters who are always greedy for more than they need.  And Le Subtil is the son of his tribe. There have been many clouds and many mountains. But now he has come to lead his nation.
That's where a lead bullet has torn you.
Colonel Munro, I have known you as a gallant antagonist. I am happy to make your acquaintance as a friend.
You have already done everything which is necessary for the honor of your Prince. I will forever bear testimony that your resistance has been gallant and was continued as long as there was hope. But now, I beg you to listen to the admonitions of humanity. I beg you to consider my terms for your surrender.
My colors?
Le mot d'ordre?
Are you planning on working tomorrow?
What do you want me to say? That it all sounds mysterious?
Here.  Put this on.  You examine him.
And?
They found this?
Was there such a thing?
Some say that's why we're basically hairless, for less water resistance, faster swimming speeds...
Why stop with just one aspect of marine life?  Why not incorporate the best genetic components the ocean has to offer?...
DeJesus!  A readout!
It's got Hazy!
I hit it.  But I can't see it!  Can you see it?!
That's an order!
Look at my foot, sir!  This bitch put a goddamn sea monster in my bunk!
You did good...
Today...with DeJesus.  That was smart thinking to get him inside...
I need more light on that, Four.
Sixpack?
Whatever made you want to do a tour down here?
We're on backup air.
What about our quota?
Shut up, all of you.
Okay, number 23's full.
Made your million, yet?
You take your money, too seriously, Bo.
Hey, Bo...when're you going to be off that thing?  I want to find out tonight's NBA scores and check the weather.
Bullshit.
What happened?
No way, Mister Beck!  <u>No</u> <u>fucking way</u>!  We just did a full shift, you can't call Shack duty on top of a full shift.  It's a contract violation!
"Routine," my ass!  Ain't nothin' "routine" about no physical check- up 10,000 feet down...especially when we're getting picked up the next day!
What's going on?
You let him get away!
I say we should go get in the escape bubbles and get the hell out of here!
Yes sir, ain't that where we usually go when we're sick?
It would explain the suction- like appendages.
What is it?
How is he?
It needs blood?
What is it?
The shack...
My pocket.  Check my pocket, will ya, honey?
A what?
Drachmas, I hope. I would feel safer with a chicken drumstick. They could do more harm than good.
Like what?
You fucking well have to get 'em!
Er, very nice Harry. What's it for?
So who's the Guv? Who we doing this for?
Nope.
Mind your language in front of my boy.
Son, have a look in his locker.
Hello, John. Nice holiday?
Son?
It's in an office; I have just left it in the office. 137
What are you doing?
How long has he been in there, son?
It's not him, Dad.
Is that you, Dean?
Listen, I don't care who lives in there; all as I know it's got to be preferable to death by Hatchet.
I want you to search the house for bugs. I mean I want you to strip it.
Yeah, one of them's out.
And all your friends, there's a good lad.
And the weed?
Are you sure you can afford twenty-five?
Guns! You never said anything about guns. A minute ago this was the safest job in the world, now it's turning in to a bad day in Bosnia . . .
Where the fuck are they going? To butcher a sheep? I thought this was a robbery.
You what? What are you on about?
I don't think we will take the risk for seven hundred quid.
There's nothing in it!
You see it's not easy to take a seat at this table; the money involved has to be a hundred grand upwards and there is no shortage of punters.
Everything all right out there, Tom?
You got it all?
I will.
I'll see ya.
That you, boy?
It's pay day, ain't it?
Well, perhaps I can't, Plank, if you know what I mean.
What are you talking about? I am bloody skinny, pal.
How much did you say it was, Tom?
Look. Go on, look.
Whatever it's going on, it's still enough to send you on a cooking course.
You would take a pain ín the arse full stop.
The money, the gear!
Joanie Orozco's telling the whole school she's like desperately in love with Santo Guerra.
That isn't true.
Private Johnson, are you unhappy in the Army?
What exactly do you think your job is, Private?
Who's "they"?
You're dismissed, Private.
And you and Private Graves--
Private Johnson!
That the word on our boy?
A .45--
Just wondering.
If it was some poor mojado, swam across at night, got lost in the scrub and starved out there, we wouldn't go any further. But this is a formerly prominent citizen.
I'm not picking it up.
You ever shoot anybody was looking you in the eye?
The Longhorns gonna kick some serious butt this Saturday, you just watch. We got a kid at tailback from down your way--outta El Indio--
You were in a fight--
It wasn't just you, Bunny.
Hey, it's the General.
You've been in this house for a while?
My mother said he never asked about--
You weren't in here tonight, were you?
He's a pretty tough old man, huh?
So I'm part-Indian?
Tanks, huh?
Yeah. He lives here, right?
Something like that.
This place is a gold mine.
Looks like a lot of cactus to me.
Since I've been stationed here? A fistfight now and then--
Hey, Mikey--
And if I get a shot at a promotion somewhere--
It's up or out these days, Cliff. Say I get transferred to a different post--
I've got the forensics fella coming down from the Rangers. No way to know how old the body is without some lab work.
Sheriff--hi--this is Sergeant--this is Priscilla Worth.
Well, yeah, but I went through the Program. I haven't had a drink since--
So.
Your boys out there cooped up together, need somewhere they can let the steam out. If they're Black, there's not but one place in this town they feel welcome. Been that way since before you were born.
Right.
Over the years, this is the one place that's always been there. I loan a little money out, settle some arguments. Got a cot in the back- people get afraid to go home they can spend the night. There's not enough of us to run anything in this town- the white people are mostly out on the lake now and the Mexicans hire each other. There's the Holiness Church and there's Big O's place.
Eladio Cruz.
Reputation?
You carryin' a firearm, son?  Don't lie to me now.
Is very beautiful, your car.
Don't tell me lies, Enrique. Que paso?
No! No puede hacer esto--[You can't do that--]
Sam! I was just telling a few about your old man.
That's a matter of interpretation--
Dammit, Sam, the people are concerned about crime--
Floating around out here, playin' hell with them bass--play a little cards, play a little golf, drink some beer--
No.
Besides my father, I mean.
You thought any more about our murder?
I got an idea what happened.
You lived in the man's house what-- seventeen, eighteen years? And you didn't get to know him any better than that?
Don't think the Rangers are likely to find out any more than they already have.
He agreed it wasn't exactly news--
Steve. Board of Education Steve who likes you? He goes for us hot-blooded Mexican girls, I can tell.
Your mother's family is Spanish?
The old-high-school-heartthrob Sheriff. I thought you were crazy about each other. He's available, you're available--
Mami, how old were you when my father--
There must have been somebody.
I'm Sheriff Deeds--
And my father?
I'm not open. We were just talking.
Mom?
Time marches on.
Three months.
That's how I ruined my stomach.
Something wrong?
Got him here?
I was--I was real sorry about Nando. He was a good fella. We haven't talked since.
I see she built a place up here by the river.
She's done well for herself--on her own and all--
I thought you got through that pretty well.
Your boy, there--
It can happen so sudden, can't it? Being left out on your own.
When Nando died--it was so sudden--I was kind of in shock for awhile. Then I woke up and there was the whole rest of my life and I didn't have any idea what to do with it.
How come it feels the same?
There's nothing on the walls. No pictures--
It isn't. Not by a long shot. He holds her and they lie silently for a moment--
You gonna tell your mother we been seeing each other?
You have any idea when your father died? Eladio?
Hospital says the other kid is in bad shape--
Any poop on the John Doe you found out there today?
Uh-huh.
White man just using you to keep the Black man down.
Hey Sam. Sorry 'bout that.
We'll get 'em--  So you livin' out here now?
Buffalo chips. Fella in Santa Fe told me he sells these as fast as the buffalo can squeeze 'em out.
They don't hand those medals out for hidin'in your foxhole. Would you buy this?
Mister D'Amour?
You ever been married?
I could have lost my fucking hands.
Maybe they're not tricks.
Thanks, Billy.
Right.
You don't have a clue what you're into, do you?
If he was just a man like me, then no.  But he's not.
Are they treating you okay?
I can be very persuasive.
They were jealous of him.
Oh Christ.
So Swann was performing magic. not illusions?  And what?  You thought he should be using it to cure cancer, not making millions.
I was twelve.  Nix took me hostage, to get Swann to come to him.
Are you all right?
Harry?
...yes?
Valentin?
What about me?
Bad show last night?
Oh God.
I'm putting in a new illusion tonight.  Will you be there?
Tapert.  So, now I've got Tapert, Butterfield.
Where the fuck is he?
No.  I'm saying they were always fake.  The saints, the messiahs, they were just illusionists.
You tell me.  No?  I thought you'd maybe have a theory.
With what?
Whatever I said, I didn't mean it, okay?  I get a few drinks inside me --
Then what do you want?
Whose is the car?
Havanas.  You're not the smoker.  So who is?
Any movie stars buried here?
Are you sure?
Who is she?
Nix is dead and buried, for fuck's sake.
Him too.
Jennifer's been with us four years. She was coming on nicely. But just the last month or so, she's worse than ever.
You need an ambulance.
You've taken some strange journeys in your life.
Where'd you learn that?
Was he taking a lot of risks?
He knew Swann way back.  He says there were a lot of drugs, a lot of crazy shit.
People are pretty cagey.  Who do you know?
A lot of people are going to be really pissed off when they discover you're still alive.
Maybe he doesn't see it that way. Maybe he's digging his way out of the hole you put him right now.  That's what you're hiding away from, isn't it?
So Nix won't come looking for her?
Oh Jeez.
You think I'm an asshole.
He had something.  He showed me how to bend the rules.  A little levitation.  A few fireworks.
No.  At the end... when we had him cornered, he got into my head. He showed me what we really look like, when the veneer's gone.  Jelly. Shit...
Yeah.  But not as cheap.  Call me.
Have we met before?
Maybe... I... don't...
What is?
Yes! Yes!
You don't think I've got it to give?
Don't touch me.  He's got... got into my head.
Because you've got nothing else to live for.
You know I'll kill you when we're done.  I have to.
But until then... it's you and me... the way it always was.
Just get me out of here as soon as you can.
Oh, hi, Elaine.
Try twenty-five.
It takes a while to figure it out. I'm sure you will, though.
Not really. How long are you here for?
Charlie, this is Bob. Bob — Charlie Brown.
I could cut the ones that are left for you.
Of course.
Yeah, I'm going to take a shower and I'll meet you downstairs.
Hey look, it's Sausalito.
Hans was very attentive to you.
I don't remember.
Why do they switch the r's and l's here?
Yeah? But look at you.
That's too scary.
You are.
You made it.
What happened to your toe?
Oh, I guess you're busy, huh.
Charlotte?
Just saying good-bye to everyone before you leave?
Lydia?
He was this fashion guy, and there were all these Japanese fashion people- it's a whole other world, and I was talking to these Japanese surfers... He was playing all this great music- I have to find out what it was...
I love you, too, good-night, or good- morning .
Hello?
That's not what I'm talking about.
Like Japanese food.
What?
Great.
Hello? Yes?
No, what are you talking about.
Like popcorn?
Oh, it's nothing... I better go, I'll talk to you later.
John! What are you doing here?
Uh...sure...I...what?
Oh, Peter, you're going to pursue this.
What?  That's horrible!
Yeah, I appreciate it.  Thanks, Josef.
Yeah, like...
It's with me all the time, Claire, I just don't like to talk about it.
I'm just temporarily off my game.
What're these?
What a...jerk!
You know, I made a reservation at Marco's for Peter's birthday dinner, but maybe you should cater it.
Sure it is.  If the guards did this, we can file charges.
So you don't believe his condition is the result of anything supernatural?
Your court order, Dr. Allen.
It's the patient's request, doctor.
Father Jeremy and Deacon John Townsend of St. Ursula's, and our associate, Maya Larkin.  Secular assistants are permitted if regarded as qualified.  Maya is eminently qualified.
There is a medical explanation for everything that happened.
How're you doing?  Looking lovely as always.
What is it?
Listen to me, Peter.  You can't let the ravings of a madman disturb you, okay?
You killed my parents.
So...we won?
What?!?!
Nothing yet.
There's nothing else here.
Plenty of time.
He's been repeating that since Birdson's exorcism.  I looked in every passage in the Bible and there's nothing about an ark or a sunset that tells us anything.
Book five, Deuteronomy, chapter seven, verse five.  "But this shall you deal with them.  You shall break down their altars and burn their graven images with fire."
And what are you thinking we should do now?
A lot of good that'll do.
But she worships you.  Your mother's dead but your father's alive.
Yeah.
Good of you to stop by.
It's as if you are saying the closer you get to evil, the less evil it becomes.
Would you sign it for me?
So, Viznick's got a meet with his lawyer in the ayem.
What's this?
He could see me.
Thanks again for everything.
It's another day.  I think I'm alright.
Parents died?
I hate it.
What?
Yeah, you met her?
I remember when I was eight years old, you spent like four hours cooking up this fancy meal.  All you'd let me and Lena do was set the table.  And I guess you and Dad got your wires crossed or something because he walks in with a couple of pizzas.  And you didn't say anything. You just threw the whole meal into some tupper-ware and tossed it in the fridge.
What are you talking about?
Okay.
So you're still breast-feeding?
Oh, me too.  I used to cook for my friends' parties and things back in Atlanta.
We've got our final games against Oregon and Oregon State and I want to shake things up a bit, so I'm starting you at point again.
That was nice.
I'm so sorry.  No one would switch flights with me.
I don't wanna see that.
Sometimes I wonder if it's worth it. Busting my ass, for what?
A horse?
The coach from Tennessee was there and he has me riding the bench.
What's up with that?
That's what you get for trying to show out, freshman.
What's up?
I know.
What's that?
Yeah, four years ago.  They had me staying in this tiny-ass town with like fifty people.  I'm not playing, there was about a thousand goats running around, and it gets dark at four o'clock.  Then the whack club I'm on loses three games in a row and I get blamed.  So they fire me.
So...does it hurt?
I don't have to do what you say.
What?
So she's honest.
So who you going to the dance with, Spalding?
See, that's why you ain't getting recruited.
Didn't know you cared so much.
Mulholland Drive.
So what dead-end street did you and Shawnee hit?
It's okay, little baby.
Kiss my booty.
Yo, where's the "D"?
Don't put your hands in your pockets, hold your head up, always look a man in the eye, and all the time I'm hanging on his every word like he's God or something...
Nothing.  Why don't we walk to my dorm?
Yeah, I hit a three at the buzzer.
Oh, Kerry, this is Monica.  Monica, Kerry.
Can we talk?
Least she had time for me.
You forgot to be there.
So that's it, just forget about us?
I thought a torn ACL was ten to twelve.
I'm tired of playing overseas.  Thinking about giving it a rest for awhile.
And you tore up your knee.  Rehab is tough.
Cause I don't get it.
I heard enough.
You're out of your mind.
And what happens when you lose?
You hearing me?
How was your game?
You scared me.
Guess he talked to you.
Why not?
You work too hard, Pop.
Besides, the sooner you go pro, the sooner you'll have to deal with the mess I'm dealing with.
Some girl that's been hanging on at every party.  now I'm supposed to be her baby's Daddy.  Anyway, I told your mom I wanted to be the one who told you.
So what are you gonna do?
Why?
We ain't got nothing to talk about.
What do you want?
What surery?
You okay?  huh?  Jimmy?
Call 911. Call 911 right now.
no, no, c'mon Jimmy we need to call this quits and you need to see a doctor.
Nothing's wrong, I just got some guy on the phone on my other line, he's says he works for this guy, this guy who's Frank's father --
Uh-huh.
What do you want? Why are you here?
Wanna call me a slut now, something?
FUCK YOU.  FUCK YOU, YOU GET OUT.
Honey.
Your mother wants to hear from you --
uh...uh...What is it?
Yeah, but I don't know --
Yes.  I had someone come to my door, someone I didn't want here and I told them to leave -- so -- it's no big deal. They left.  I'm sorry.
About two years ago.
Yeah.
got some coffee brewing, huh?
You take cream or sugar?
Many times, in damestic abuse situations the young lady is afraid to speak, but I have to tell you that, being a police officer, I've seen it happen: Young woman afraid to speak, next thing you know, I'm gettin' a call on the radio, I got a 422 --
Well if you listen' to that music too loud again and that fella returns maybe we'll share another cup of coffee --
I'm sorry, Claudia.
Yeah.
Do you wanna go tonight?  I mean, are you working?
Eight o'clock?
So you've done it --
-- well I'm a real...y'know, straight when it comes to that...curse words I just don't use much --
-- what kind?
Not enough, what do you want?
Can you hold it?
I have to go to the bathroom, Cynthia.
C'mon, Dad.  We gotta just GET HIS MONEY AND GO, LET'S GO. Let's get the money --
GIVE US YOUR MONEY, KID.
DAD --
Tell me what you know, I'll tell you what I know --
You wanna disrespect an officer of the law?
Are you a joker? huh? Tellin' jokes?
I'm walking towards the elevator's, Janet.
Do you have love in your heart?
Is it real love?
Things go round 'n round, don't they?
I confuse melancholy and depression sometimes....
I'm sick.
I lent my name, my celebrity. Exactly --
And how much is braces?
I've been a good worker --
I don't know.
I just, I just -- I just -- I'm just in a fucking state, I know he's going and it's like I don't know how -- just tell me <u>practical</u> things -- What the fuck do I do with his body? What happens when he dies? That next moment: What? What do I do?  Then What?
-- you don't understand: it's more pain than before and the fucking morphine pills aren't working, he's -- past two days it's like he can't really swallow them and I don't know if they're going down -- I can't see inside his mouth anymore -- I'm up all night staring at him and I don't think the pills are going down and he moans and he hurts --
How's today then?
I don't know...I mean, he's around, he's here, in town, y'know, but I don't know...he's a tough one...very.... Do you have a girlfriend, Phil?
She's a good girl.  She's a little nuts, but she's a good girl I think. She's a little daffy.
...cocksucker....
...I can't hold onto this anymore...
...gimme that fuckin' phone...
You wanna call him on the phone? We can call him, I can dial the phone if you can remember the number --
She had cancer...from her...in her stomach and I didn't go anywhere with her...and I didn't do a god thing... for her and to help her....shit...this bitch...the beautiful, beautiful bitch with perfect skin and child bearing hips and so soft...her namewasLilysee?  He liked her though he did, his mom, Frank/Jack...he took care of her and she died. She didn't stick with him and he thinks and he hates me, ok...see...I'm...that's then what you get? ....are you still walkin' in that car...?
I think you have the wrong number.
If you're up to it, I've got us set up in a suite upstairs --
I'm confused about your past is the thing.
Do you remember a Miss Simms?
No, this is about getting something right and claryfying one of your answers to an earlier question --
I was told that your mother died. That your mother died when you were young --
Are you close?
Do you have your masters?
And you went to Van Nuys High, right?
Uh-huh.  What's going on?
Is he in pain?
How long...you think?
I've heard your tapes on the phone.
When they put me on hold, to talk to you...they play the tapes. I mean: I'd seen the commercials and heard about you, but I'd never heard the tapes ....
Can you stand...back...maybe, I mean... just a little bit...in the room is ok, but back from us a little...
You can't just come in here.
You're here.
I preffer to stand.
Yes I can, Marcie.  And until you start givin' me some straight answers: I'm gonna assume that some mischief has been goin' on here.
No. No. Stay down, Marcie, sit back down on that couch --
WHAT'S THIS? WHAT'S THIS? GOD DAMN BULLSHIT. BULLSHIT. DON'T PUT THOSE --
This is the LAPD. If anyone is back here I want you to come out and I want you to show yourself to me with your hands in the air --
...you know...
What happend to you?
Rose is on the phone and here's the cards for today --
I'm sorry.
Slowly or quickly?
Did you tell her?
...No...I don't hate you.  Do you want talk...do you really want to talk to me and say things and get things figured out, Jimmy?
hey.
What? No, Rose, jesus, no --
Why doesn't Claudia talk to you, Jimmy?
...say it, Jimmy...
I'm asking you.  I'm asking you if you know why Clauida will not speak to you....please, Jimmy....tell me.
Jimmy, did you touch her?
...Jimmy...
Yes you do.
Hello?
You're Jimmy Gator, right?
I'm sorry.
Do you have an agent, Stanley?
Commercials, a sitcom, an MOW or something.
Are you on drugs right now?
-- that can't happen.  Earl doesn't want him to have the money, the things.
Shut the fuck up.
Shut the fuck up. Shut the fuck up.
Linda --
Cats and Dogs out there, huh?
yeah.
Do you still want the peanut butter, bread and cigarettes ?
What are they gonna do -- beat us?
The fuck is wrong with you?
Why didn't you answer those questions?
...oh Jesus, what the fuck...?
Hi.
..sorry...
You know what it's like to come home scared, scared that maybe if you don't have the money you're supposed to go out each day and get that you're gonna get beaten....by a belt...he hits me with a belt, Stanley....  I'm supposed to sell those candy bars, and if I don't, I come home without the money....
No.  No.  I have to do this on my own.
God smiled upon us.
M'lady... if anyone sees, it is death...
There were two.  Not one.  But two.
What is it, mother?
Your birthday celebration, your Majesty?
If I find out the identity of this Jesuit rebel.  I will kill both him and the man who told me.
Porthos sleeps, and you plot.  Don't you think it's time you told me what it is you are plotting?
Who is he, Aramis?
It is not just our lives you risk with this conceit of yours!  It is Phillippe's as well!
You can do it.
What you're asking is impossible!
A simple theological discussion.
Look at us.  We are old men now.  But once we were young.  And when we saw injustice, we fought it.
D'Artagnan... Those are young Musketeers down there.  They have been weaned on our legends.  They revere us -- it is an advantage. Why don't we charge them?
I just said you're praying!  Are you deaf too?  I know you're blind, because if you had seen the tits that just walked out of here, you'd have tears in your eyes.
I observe your forgiveness isn't sweeter than a plump nipple.
It is a weighty problem, Aramis -- but perhaps you should leave it to this secret General of the Jesuits, whoever he might be.
And why are you so glum?
Athos, do you understand this?  He confuses me --
But what if something extraordinary happened?  Something so unusual that all the attention went to someone else?  Someone whose confirmation of Phillippe the King would never be questioned.
Piglet -- ?  What are you -- ?
I have ordered a drill of the Royal Guard for midnight, and must be clear-headed for it.
You knew this was happening.  You knew and that's why you came.
Athos, please...!
The desire for vengeance... can be a poison.
You look so sad.  Is it something I have done?
What is that?
Are you hungry?
This place... I once lived in a country house.  I had guardians -- an old man and woman.  And tutors. But no friends.  Then when I was twelve, they came and took me to the prison.
A man in black.  I never saw his face.  He took me to the cell.  A blacksmith came and they put me into the mask.  For days I shouted, "What have I done?  Why do you do this to me?"  But no one heard, so I just stopped shouting.
But I deployed the Royal Guards according to your previous --
Aaa!  D'Artagnan!  These passages were constructed for the King's security, not so you could step from my father's portrait and startle me to death!
Betrothed?  I think not.
Miss Beaufort has accepted our invitation.  By this we can only suppose that she wishes to come -- as we wish her to be here.
You dare criticize my father?!  Or lecture me?!
That is enough!  You are a good servant, d'Artagnan, but you forget your place!
Even the bedchamber passages!  Let none remain!
I -- I thought he was but... an impostor who resembled --
Your Majesty... This man before you... He is royal blood, the same as you.  To spill it is the one thing even you cannot do.  It is against the laws of God, and of France.
Not once have I ever asked anything for myself.  I ask now.  Forgive this man, this prisoner... your brother.
Aramis, Porthos and Athos too.  I know what they have done was a threat against you -- and yet that threat has been removed, with no harm coming to your Majesty.  If their passions were in error, their spirits have ever been noble. Forgive them.
... The ball... Continue.
Wait.  Bargain me to Louis, for all your lives.  You have done your best.  Let me go, and let all of you find peace.
Food, moron.
Do you want Athos arrested, your Majesty?
Riots?  My people live in the world's most beautiful city, their king has the grandest palaces on earth.  Why should they feel anything but pride and contentment?
The food doesn't please you?
Our agency monitors all threats very carefully, and there's good reason to believe Jim Trudell has the training, the connections, and the experience to present a clear threat to the public if he remains at large.
It's Marvosa -
We're by Ozone...
Why didn't you call for back-up! What were you thinking, Jesus!!!
Let's roll -
Nineteen eighty four.  What fucking difference does it make?
Something wrong with you Marvosa?
Yeah?
You know, you don't seem afraid of much either.  How do you know I'm not going to try to rape you?
What's going on here?
Well you figured wrong!  And now I'm public enemy number one.  You have an answer for that?
What exactly did you see?
There's something I've been meaning to ask you, Stephanie.
Holy shit -
And?...
Donut?
OK...county tax records...they're saying 1490 Breckinridge is owned by... an Atlantic Trust Corporation...they have a P.O. box in D.C.
Where did you learn to fight like that? JIM  I read a book.
Are you a regular there?
You don't seem afraid of much.
No - that's not it!  She said her boyfriend stranded her up there! I didn't ask her to come with me!
What?
What about him?
I wouldn't presume to try.
No. It happened when Graham went to see Hobbs' daughter four months later in the hospital. She saved her carotid artery.., but lost three fingers and her larynx. She was connected up to a voice box.  When Graham went to see her, she asked him -- through the speaker: 'Why did you have to kill my daddy?'  That's when Graham had his nervous breakdown.
Sidney: I don't understand him.  We know he re-arranges the kids and husbands into a dead audience.  To witness the act. We know he thinks the act is making him into something different. His 'becoming'... but I don't know what it is he thinks he's becoming.  The answer is something to do with how he uses the mirrors. That's what's missing for me.  Why the mirrors?
The Chicago office is running through all the personal ads in the Tattler right now.
We got an ad order in tonight's "Tattler" with 'six-six-six' in it. It's being Telexed to you right now.
Let's go to bed. I'll rub your back.
That's not entirely true, Will. It's the way you think.
You think I'm gonna spot him 'across a crowded room?'  That's Ezio Pinza you're thinking about.  The Tooth Fairy will go on until we get smart or get lucky. He won't stop.
Is it weird?
Get me a plane...
When are you coming back?
He's a very shy boy...
You mean Jacobi put it in between when this film was made and when he was murdered?
No. It's Bob's Photo Store in...
It does, doesn't it?
Fogel has four more names. He knows two: both dark hair. Third's a woman. Fourth's a handicapped parking permit...
Will...?
There's somebody in the house, Jack...
...twenty-eight minutes.  Cryptography at Langley?
When do you need it?
I'll take you.
Ready to tell me what kind of 'outing' this is?
Is that you. D?
Good morning...  If you show me where things are, I'll make us some coffee...
My sister's coming by to pick me up for brunch. Why don't you come, too?
Who is it?
SHE'LL FUCK OTHER PEOPLE. PRETTY PEOPLE. SHE'LL PUT IN HER MOUTH THEIR...
YOU GIVE ME HER AND THE SHERMANS! YOU BETTER GIVE ME BOTH!
Are you cold? Would you like a blanket?
Do you feel privileged?
Do you believe God is in attendance here, Mr. Lounds?
Are you queer, Mr. Lounds?
Now you will read this into the tape recorder.
Can you read it to me?
In a holding cell.
He's white and six feet tall. You haven't told me anything yet.
He stopped by to see me at the shop before he came out here.
He asked how you are.
You mended a crack in the wallpaper with your diploma.  You are open and easy now... It took you a lot of work to get to that...
Me, too. And very erotic...
What's this Mama shit?
Let's forget who said what to whom...
It's Will Graham. Is Molly there, Mr. Swenson?
Will it keep them out?
How many turtle eggs you think are in here?
Are you gonna kill him?
How did it happen?
How?
She got all right?
A layman..., layman. Interesting term. So many experts on government grants. And you say you're a 'layman?' But it was you who caught me, wasn't it, Will? Do you know how you did it'
Yes, I thought so.
No.
I wanted to congratulate you for the job you did on Mr. Lounds. I admired it enormously. What a cunning boy you are, Will.
Why does it feel good?
I'm gonna spray your suit jackets. It'll be invisible in this light, but you'll stand out like a zebra for us.  They told me you checked out a .44 Charter Arms Bulldog.
People love... comedians.
No.
Andy... this is every comedian's dream.
You have to do it.
They're IMPOSSIBLE!!  Jesus!  I mean -- "two guaranteed guest shots for Tony Clifton"??!  Who is this TONY CLIFTON?!
You signed for five years --  So four years, seven months.
When you play the Midwest and South, you DON'T MINDFUCK THESE PEOPLE! It's not postmodern -- it's rude.  If you wanna perform in Texas, you give 'em Mighty Mouse!  You give 'em Elvis!!
Oh dear!  George, this is gonna kill Tony. He's waited his whole life for this break.
That means it was a success.  I woke up the audience -- like punk rock!  Here, take this.
They're having a laugh...
Maybe I can turn it into a bit.  I can go back on the show, and say it was rigged.  Demand a recount...
Hey!  Our first phone call!  Hello?
Do you wanna tour the clubs?
Andy... uhh... this network has a long-standing policy: The viewer must be able to see the program.
Ten.
Right...
What are you talking about?!  We just met an hour ago.
Gosh, you scored!  Look at all those goodies!
Popcorn?
Andy, the theater's that way!
Why did you call me?  The last person I ever expected to get a call from was you.
Why Memphis?
Then stop treating me like a fucking prop.
Have you told your family?
You're not listening to me --
GET OFF!
My father said I should've gotten a lawyer --!
Hey Andy, good show.
Each show is worse than the next.
It's so dirty.
"Was this in actuality Andy Kaufman? And if it was Andy Kaufman, is Andy Kaufman crazy?"
Sir, do you have a problem?
I, I was asked to do this material - -
Hey -- that stuff gets written-up in the papers --
This is great.  The crowd's gonna love this!  Hey... do you still think any of those cowgirls are still alive?
Are you at peace with your family?
Goals are important.
"Philosophically"?
Please!  You've GOT to let me take the classes!  It's how I keep myself BALANCED!!
It's probably just a strained muscle.
Really?!  You want Tony Clifton to headline Harrah's Tahoe??
We had a deal!!
Who is this? TONY CLIFTON  You -- you know damn straight who it is.  Tony Clifton!  A name to respect.  A name to fear.  Beer.  Gear.  Deer.  Ear.
Hmph!  They sure didn't give Andy much to do.
What's in Memphis?
JESUS CHRIST!!!!!
Sure...
Lieutenant?
I sent two units.  They're bringing her down now.
Who is it?
Is that...?
I'm going to let you in on a little secret here.  Now don't tell him I told you this, but this ain't the first time Morpheus thought he found the One.
Dead.  All dead.
Thanks... for the drink.
Operator.
I got a fibrillation!
Give me your phone.
What is he doing?
Morpheus...
No!  It's too far away.
No way, no way, this is crazy.
This line is tapped so I must be brief.
Do you still want to meet?
Why not?
... am I dead?
How does she know?
Morpheus, I don't think this is a good idea.
Did you believe in them too?
How is he?
I'm going to make the call.
Sorry, kid.  You got the gift but looks like you're waiting for something.
Hello, Neo.
I know a lot about you.  I've been wanting to meet you for some time.
My name is Trinity.
E.M.P.  An electromagnetic pulse.
But an Oracle can.
What happened?  What did you see?
No one has ever done anything like this.
You moved like they moved.  I've never seen anyone move that fast.
Morning.  Did you sleep?
Does it?  I don't know.  This can't be just coincidence.  It can't be! Can it?
They've burned through the outer shields.
Isn't this Jack Groppi's place?
No, really, I liked it...thought it was great.
What are your plans?
It's obvious that the girl doesn't want to accompany you, isn't it?
Well, I don't know if we want to buy all $40 worth...
Riverdale.
Well, we got $40, and we wanna buy...
See what I mean?  A question please...'Is this what you call living?'
No.
Listen, I appreciate it, but I'll handle it myself.  I'll write.
Waddaya think?
You got some mouth!
Yeah, big man...get yourself in more trouble.  You make a fool out of him, you're doing the same to me. I signed for you don't forget.
You couldn't handle shit.  You just better come through with some kind of payment on Tuesday...anything. Understand?  Hold onto your pay- check this week.
What do you mean?
I don't get involved with anything, you understand that?  Nothing!  I'm clean as far as you know...right?
Your cousin here was getting sick, worrying about you.  We've been in here calling...
Well kids...have the bans been announced yet?
Don't you move!!!
Your Uncle's a good man...I won't stick him.  Either he gets the money or the place and right now he's getting the place.  And tell me why should I care?  I got a partner who's a bum, who doesn't help out...who disappears and leaves me with all the problems.  I should go back to Florida...I don't need this.
I should know?  His wife don't even know.  Probably off with one of his little girls...I don't know.  I tell you, if he don't give a damn, then I don't give a damn...Why should I kill myself?
Look...I don't know.  What am I supposed to be, his keeper or something?  Yeah, he's supposed to be here but who knows what goes on in his head.  Right?
What's a'matter?
Look, Michael, I'll get him here. What do you want me to do, kill him?
Where's the rest?
You're really crazy.
No, I'm serious...You're really good.
No...no stripping...as the hostess.
Ok.  Chinese.  We'll meet on the corner of 6th Avenue and Waverly Place after you finish.
You're right uncle.  I must have gotten it confused with something else.
I really couldn't believe it when you told me, you know that?
Who knows?  It's not hard to figure out what she'll wind up like.  When the respect for parents breaks down, that's bad...you know I'm "cumpari" with them...so I take an interest.  You live next door, keep an eye open...but don't get involved.
Nothing.
It's only a couple of courses...just for the draft.
Why don't you take a look around the place if you want?
Please take it.
Sure...it's not that...I mean...
Alright... Hey, did you hear any more about what happened last night?
It doesn't make any sense.  He wouldn't shoot him just because he insulted a racket guy...not unless it was personal.
It's still sick.
Bore.
That W.A.S.P. bastard.
I'm going to take that apartment uptown.
The building on the corner.  That one!  He's been on the roof a half hour now!
Teresa?...Yeah, Charlie.  Listen, I'm looking for your cousin.  Yeah, well today's Tuesday, payday.  I haven't seen him all day...no...well, have you got any idea where he is?  I know it's early yet but I'm just getting worried that's all...
and a double for you and Charlie here.  And put it on my tab, willya?
Hey Johnny, where're you goin'?
What'sa matter...forget your registration?
You mean it's heisted.
How about me?  I don't get a drink John?
...We're never all together two nights in a row.  Maybe Christmas, Thanksgiving, that's it.  What's going on?
Did he?  That's more than we get to do.
Daddy!
Have you got a minute?
I know you do, darling.
You know, we're going to give this party for you whether you like it or not.
I don't like cake.
Oh, the goddam party --
I do it because I love you.  Because everybody I loved you.  Mommy -- wher- ever she is -- Susan, Quince, the people who work for you, everybody who's ever known you.
...This shit's not bad.
And that?
Yes, sir?
Drew, you're out of line.
Incidentally, Joe, where're you staying?
Nice to see you.  I didn't expect you, but certainly you can't get enough of a good thing.
Hot or cold.
Yes.
May I interrupting?
Is this a state secret or are we being excluded just for the fun of it?
Perhaps you could remind me.
No, I don't --
So tell me, tell me, I'm peeing in my pants.
'Thoughts'?  Not a one -- but I did hear a voice last night.
Yeah, something he goes by --
Sorry...um - you - you know it's gone right out of my head --
Have we met?
No --
You're not familiar with the phrase, "In this world, nothing is certain but Death and Taxes"?
Shall we adjourn?
Joe, cut it out.  And you too, Drew.
What is there to say?  They know what John Bontecou is -- and if they didn't, they know now.
Whose?
Yes, you are to understand that, and now may I ask you a question?
I've already introduced Mr. Black to you all.
You're overthinking it --
No, I come to see Doctor.
Good morning, Mr. Parrish.
-- And call my family, I'd like them to come over for dinner tonight.
Black.
That's very gracious of you, Quince.
You're an original, Joe.  A little hard to figure, maybe...
Thanks.
'Love'?  Oh, man, I've got troubles of my own.
Oh yes, I do.
Because there's nothing we don't know about each other and it's okay. I mean the deeper, darkest secrets -- they don't matter.
'Big'?
What are your intentions?  To make little dreams in coffee shops, turn a woman's head, and I don't mind admitting it was turned, I liked it, but ten hours later I feel like a fool.  I don't get it.  You, my father, here in this house, the cof- fee shop, it's making me upset, and I don't like being upset.  Who are you anyway?  And what are you eating?
Joe --
And I'll be a visitor.
She's in a great deal of pain.
Yes...
I'm very concerned about the woman you attended to today.
Has her pain abated?
Why?
Yes.  Your father and I, our time together has come to an end.
No worse than it gets for me.  I'm in love with a woman whom I don't want to leave.
I - uh --
...I'm sorry, I'm a little discon- certed, that stuff between you and Susan -- uh -- threw me.
So there's nothing between you and Susan?
How are you?  How're you feeling?
Um -- well, I didn't sleep too well. This is crazy.  This is the left- field thing of all time.  What do I do?  What do I tell my family?
And what?
Sounds fair enough.
What I'm trying to say is this is a Board meeting and you are not a mem- ber of the Board.
-- What's the deal here?  Are you going to be breathing down my neck right 'til the very end?
...I'd like to be alone for a while.
Truly - uh - splendid.
And more.
Why did you go to the hospital?
About Susan?
Hello, Bill.
Okay.  Goodnight.
With all due respect, Bill, I'm not asking your permission.
Thanks.
Those were my words, Bill.
No.
Joe, don't do this --
Am I dreaming this?  Are you a dream?
That's me.
You want me to be your guide --?
I do?  How long will you be staying?
Excuse me?  Could I say something?
'Yes' what?
I think you know --
Are you giving me orders?
Where are you?
The great Bill Parrish at a loss for words?  The man from whose lips fall 'rapture' and 'passion' and 'obses- sion'...all those admonitions about being 'deliberately happy', what there is no sense 'living your life without...', all the sparks and energy you give off, the rosy advice you dispense in round, pear-shaped tones --
About what?
Get what?
I'm sorry --
This one.
I still sense some doubt in this group, we could turn it around. You'll be up in the country?
Eddie, hold out all the hope you want but, I promise you, it's hope- less, it's over.  Come on up, let's get drunk, if I had your shoulder to lean on I might actually enjoy this --
If you're trying to show me lay- down-in-front-of-the-bus loyalty, forget it.
Well, thank you, that's great, but it's more than I bargained for.  I just wanted to set the record straight.
I hope so.
I don't like to interfere.
Susan, you're a hell of a woman. You've got a great career, you're beautiful --
That's for me.  I'm talking about you.  It's not so much what you say about Drew, it's what you don't say.
Oh yes, I am.  Not an ounce of excitement, not a whisper of a thrill, this relationship has all the passion of a pair of titmice.
Well, it worries me.  I want you to get swept away.  I want you to levitate.  I want you to sing with rapture and dance like a dervish.
Daddy, what's the matter?
What is it, Daddy --?
Nothing.
Then what is it?
What a night.
I'm still here.  Would you like to dance with me, Susan?
Why?
79.
That's it?
Like waking. Like you always just woke up.							 *
How long have I been here?
So you're holding my calls?
What makes you think he's my friend?
Last week. Then I rented you another one On top of this.
So how many rooms am I checked into in this dump?
Well, at least you're being honest about cheating me.
I know you said you didn't want any calls...
I like your car.
Where'd you get it?
Why?
You don't remember me.
You know him?
Have I told you what this man did?				*
Sleep okay?
Something feels wrong. I think someone's fucking with me. Trying to get me to kill the wrong guy.
Such as?
What do the police think?
What are you gonna do?
Did you?
Just take it easy, this isn't my fault.
A BEER, please.
You tell me.
I'm not interested in the company position, Mr. Shelby. I want to know your honest opinion about Sammy.
I'm not appealing the decision.
I believe that Sammy should be physically capable of making new memories.
Beg my forgiveness! Beg my wife's forgiveness before I blow your brains out!
I'm Leonard Shelby, I'm from San Francisco and I'm -
Shut your mouth!
Yeah, it's just this fucked-up building.		    * Why are we going there?
Things change.
It's my condition. I never know if I've already eaten, so I always just eat small amounts.
You're living.
We can't just walk him out tied up and bleeding.
It must be his. I don't think they'd let someone like me carry a gun.
So was he scared?
Who the fuck are you?
What sort of questions?
How'd you know I was in here?
How do you know him?
He might have fallen down the stairs, I don't know, I don't know what's going on, I'm confused. I have this memory thing - do I know you?
I don't know. See, I have this condition.
I was wrong! That's the whole point! Sammy's wife came to me and -
My wife wasn't diabetic.
She wasn't diabetic. You think I don't			 * know my own wife? What the fuck is wrong		    * with you?							*
Why? You're never going to know.				  *
You know, when we found your guy and			   * killed him.  That's right, the real John G. Over a			  * year ago. I helped you find him. He's			  * already dead.							 *
I should kill you.							 *
It is now.
Okay. We clean him up, untie him and			   * march him out with a gun in his back.			  *
Bullshit.							*
* Thank you.							    *
With Sonny.  110%.
...eliminated one.  SWAT's on the next two...
...I didn't want you around the crime scene because it's crawling with federal law enforcement.  We don't know who's straight up, who's not...
Yeah?
We're not certain...
You need to consider a few issues.
I don't know.
We want it back.
The Keys?
Havana?  Cubans don't like us or my business...
Were you born in Havana?
Your father?
And why should continuing excellence cost more?
Is it December?
Did Christmas come early this year...?
What if I pushed to twenty-one...?
Hola, chica.
Do you have assets somewhere else? Bank accounts?
You afraid of violence?
I do.  We don't do business with him...
How 'bout this?  How'd Neptune know where to hit us?  Huh?  Whose Op sec's got a leak?  Yours?
Stevens?
Aryan brothers are not going to change-up suppliers.  So...
Track with me, here...  They knew the "Russians" were undercover Feeb?  They should have no-showed.  But, no, these guys show anyway, and commit murder upon federal officers.  And steal all your money...  What does that say to you?
Then it don't work.
What do we got?
Yeah.  CIA-level stuff...
Hey, fuck him.
If we were for real, and knew our shit, we'd fade this one...
4-4-7 Charlie 12-92.
Guy's involved in a "meet"...
Get into business with this crew, identify them.  Illuminate their network.  If you're lucky, discover their source, how they penetrated us.  We'll indict and take it from there...
Never heard of him.
What are you talking about?
Out of...?
Where are you?
Correct.  Flash samples.  Flash cash.
Oh, good...
As in, your ass is dead in the water.
Okay.
And violence is extra.  And expensive.  So how much weight you looking to move?
What do you care?
What...?
Ain't gonna collect your pay?
Well, that's something never happened to me before, you can bet your bottom dollar. Uh, where's the matches, ma'am?
Cut it out. That's cheating, teasing me so I can't think. Just one bitsy Y word and I gonna beat you!
That is one hell of a shirt. I bet you paid a pretty price for it, am I right?
... you see what I'm getting at here? She got a penthouse up there with color TV and more goddam diamonds than an archbishop and she busts out bawling when I ask for money!
For money.
Rico then, at least call me Rico in my own goddam place.
Shee-it. Cough yourself inside out, then light a fag, a goddam fag. You make me puke. Where'd you steal it? In the movies?
Kee-rist, you sure are one twisty little bastard, Ratso.
Well, this thought just struck me. It wasn't too long ago I was washing dishes way the hell somewhere in Texas.
Did I say that? Did I?  It don't say nothing about you...
But they picked me, right? So what I'll do, I'll just say, now look, you want me? Well, I don't go nowhere without my buddy here.
You got a comb?
Well, I don't think I can walk.  I mean, I been falling down a lot and, uh...
Okay. Here it is. You gonna go see the doctor. I got nine bucks and twenty more Thursday and I gonna be riding high before you know it. So you gonna get you the best goddam doctor in this town and get yourself straightened out, that's what.
If you have to shiver, why don't you pull the blanket up more?
I'm falling apart, that's funny?
A drink? I've got some nice gin. If you'd prefer something else, they'll send it up...
I'm going to Florida.
Here. Don't even thank me.
You're a wonderful boy. You'n me gonna have fun, dammit, it don't have to be joyless. Say, why don't we get right down on our knees now?
You got it.
He fell. Hey, fella, you fell. Is he all right?
Years?
You got that, shit face? Asina...
Want me to take over?
What?
To what?
Too bad you didn't have a machine.
Gotta be here someplace.  Thought I heard a couple of dead Christians singing down there.
Yeah. How's Mom?
Why'd you do it, Billy?
What's your father do?
Just Erich.
What's wrong?
No... It looks like your going to have a new court.
Yeah,  for the criminally insane.  I was there once for two weeks and it ain't an illusion. It's awful. Namidou runs it like a death camp, that's where he spends most of his time...
You got your stuff?
Shit!  Shit!  Shit!
Goddamn Gastro's killing me.  Making me blind. Hey Billy!
Max, sit down. You're in no shape to kill anybody.
What'd the Prosecutor say?
Jeremy...
Not just any carbohydrates, mind you. It was like being on the receiving end of some kind of transcendent oral sex.  We should get a strobe on this thing. Maybe even a siren.
There are thirty five listed in the reverend Wong's roster...
Fine.  You want me to call your supervisor?
Leonard, listen.  I need to see if there's any nerve damage before we carry you back.  Look, I'm trying to help you here...
Can we get this car there?
He didn't do it!
We're no leaving you!
I didn't protect him, lady. He trusted me. And I didn't protect him... His father...I lost his father to the streets and now, Chuy...
You know where they get this fertility stuff?  They extract it from the urine of menopausal Italian nuns.
He was just doing his job.
I get the feeling they came more for the potroast than the apterids.
Why take the chance?  Just let me go down there with you...
So, you're saying this is like those bugs that -- that look like twigs or leaves or...
You guys have done a nice job.  How bout five dollars?
What?
Not a big one.  I mean, it was like a turkey baster.
This wing configuration. I've never...
God told me, since I was his number- one fan, that I should make up new stories as if I was Paul Sheldon. So, went to town. And I bought a typewriter. And paper to type on. The same kind Paul Sheldon used. And I turned the guest bedroom into a writing studio. Would you like to see it?
Sure.
Must get lonely, living out here all by yourself.
I have a hard and fast rule about who can read my stuff at this early stage--only my editor, my agent, and anyone who saves me from freezing to death in a car wreck.
Pretty rough so far.
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to wake you.
Well, mine's still out. But the ones in town were working just fine. I called that agent of yours.  Oh, Paul, I peeked at the very beginning.  What a wonderful first page--just to read the name Misery Chastain...
...it's like a visit from my oldest, dearest friend.
I don't mean to pry, but I've read in two magazines now where you were seeing this model who does those disgusting jeans commercials. And I said it can't be true. Paul Sheldon would never waste his time with a trampy woman like that.
For a while I thought I might go crazy.
Then who did?
What are you doing on the floor?  It's my fault. If I'd had a proper hospital bed, this never would have happened. Here, let me help you back in.  I know this hurts, but it'll only take a few seconds. There you go. Comfy?
You're such a kidder. I have a big surprise for you. But first there's something you must do.
But this time I thought clearly. I asked God about you and God said "I delivered him unto you so that you may show him the way."
You want me to burn my book?
You want me to burn my book?
Then light the match, Paul.
Oh, Paul. This isn't about money. It's about decency and purity. It's about God's values.
Work? You mean write? What in the world do you think I'd write?
Misery's Return?
Yes. It will be a book in my honor. For saving your life and nursing you back to health. I'll be the first one to read it.  Oh, Paul, you're going to make me the envy of the whole world...
I guess you don't get bothered by neighbors much.
Are you sure? 'Cause if you want, I'll bring back the whole store for you.
I'm sorry, Paul. This is all wrong, you'll have to do it over again.
Paul, what you've written just isn't fair.
What's the matter, Paul? You haven't written a word.
The "gotta." Remember, you talked about it in Playboy magazine. You said there's a million things you can't do in this world; you can't hit a curve ball, you can't fix a leaky faucet or make a marriage work-- but there's one thing you always have, and that's the power of the "gotta."
What about a bee...?
I've known from the very first book that Misery had to be born of nobility and I was right!
I've never had meatloaf this good, what do you do to it?
Paul, I know you've been out.
I'll drive a sledgehammer into your man-gland if you're not nicer--
I know you do. I love you too, Annie.  And you're right. We are meant to be together. And I know we must die. But it must be so that Misery can live. We have the power to give Misery eternal life. We must finish the book.
Did I do good?
Stop--stop right here.
You don't think he's dead, do you?
It was an old car--those dents could have been there forever.
Hey, Jim, what's doing? Uh-huh... uh- huh... Jim, we've been over this. If you're gonna have benches in front of your store, people are gonna sit on them. I don't like him either, but I'm not going to come over there and tell him to move. Give my best to Denise. Bye.
Virginia, I'm flattered you think I got that much energy. I just figured if I can't find Paul Sheldon, at least I can find out what he wrote about.
That thing.  Here it is. Right where it's supposed to be.
I appreciate that. Thanks a lot.
No, see, he always ordered a bottle of Dom Perignon when he was ready to go. Then he'd pay up and be out the door.
I don't think Mr. Sheldon likes for things to be out of the ordinary. Considering who he is and all, famous and all, he doesn't have airs. Drives the same car out from New York each time--'65 Mustang--said it helps him think. He was always a good guest, never made a noise, never bothered a soul. Sure hope nothing happened to him.
I'll bet that old Mustang's pulling into New York right now.
Hey, Pete.
Answer me a couple things?
Marcia, please.
I like it. Remember how you once said I live my whole life as if I'm in danger of being found out? Well, I believe I've managed to get that guy down on paper.  Don't think I'm completely nuts, but in some way, Annie Wilkes, that whole experience, helped me.
I thought you were over it.
One considers her timing, of course - getting nicked within a week of the plane going down.  Suggestive, even borderline suspicious, but hardly conclusive.
I thought you were going to dinner.
What made you pick <i>that</i> nag?  She'd never won a bloody thing.
To win?
Oh, no, not at all.  Maybe just a bit.
God damn it, Nyah!  Why did you do it?  Why did you save that bastard?
Where?
It is, Billy.
So Ambrose has Bellerophon and McCloy's got Chimera.
We're due to take off.
I'm booted up.  Go, Ethan.
She's in the elevator heading toward Ethan.
Do you know me?
Under the circumstances I think we would recommend re-setting the senors to respond to a lighter load.  How do you feel about forty kilos, Miss Hall?
I'm missing something here, aside from a 500,000 pound necklace.  Even after I botched the job, I could've walked out of there with the bloody thing.
You're apologizing for me?  Quite the gentleman..
What's you name?
The only other spook I knew was a liar. Charming but absolutely incapable of telling the truth.  He'd lie about his favorite color.  But then I reckon it's an occupational hazard.  All spies really do is conceal the truth and tell lies.
So where did I got right?
There's nearly 2 million in London.
And that's the only reason?
Much.
Before you are.
You'll be fine.  I'm going to lose you.
Nyah, you've done more than enough.  Even the best of snake charmers get bit.
Easy, easy, easy, shhh!
No.
Like it's a good idea to pick him up in a hurry.  And a bad idea to fly him on a commercial carrier.  So let's get on with it.  He's still in Sydney?
When I couldn't find you, I had to replace you.  Sean Ambrose was the obvious choice. He double you, what?  Two, three times?
'Terrorists?'
- good.  Then if you manage to get hold of Ambrose, and obtain what he's got, you've got -  - 8 hours 57 minutes and twenty-three seconds to destroy the largest remaining source of Chimera on earth.
Something else?
Of course it was.  Anyone whose operations requires the level of disinformation that yours do, is bound to get a little flak here and there.  You try flogging the stories on CNN I've had to come up with about what's been going on around here the last few days.  At any rate, it's been most instructive -- what they'll swallow, or what they'll broadcast with a straight face.  Miss Hall's blood, it appears, has absolutely no elements of the Chimera virus.  Not even antibodies.
But you were under specific instructions to bring back a living sample of the Chimera virus.  I'd be very interested to know how, after you'd managed its recovery intact, it subsequently got destroyed.
They're ready and waiting.  You'll soon be with old friends.
..I'm fine..and you?
I don't know, but Nekhorvich was not a manic.  Get me a twenty on Nyah.
I kill Chimera at Biocyte and he's sitting on a cure without a disease.
Luther, say again.
A visit from an old friend.
Kasimov, Kasimov, good that you called us.
Nothing but civilians, Gene.
Two minutes til Krieger shows.  Thisíll have to be quicker than Iíd like. Certainly quicker than youíd like.
Satisfied?
Krieger can get it.  Right?
I don't think you're in any position to give orders, do you?  Not while I'm holding this.
I want to sleep.  Can I sleep here.
Are <u>you</u> all right Ethan.  What's wrong with you?
Ethan -- Ethan, it's okay.  It's Claire. Ethan what's wrong with you?
That was four hours ago!  Who sent you? Did they send you here?
Did they send you...Did they send you?
Who sent you?!  Who sent you?
The message is for Job.
Jim was my husband. I want to know who killed him.  I want to get the son of a bitch who did this.
May I come in?
I didn't say that.
Claire.
This is Kittridge.
What?
For a little over two years now we've been spotting serious blowback in IMF operations.  We have a penetration.  The other day we decoded a message on the Internet from a Czech we know as "Max."
Kittridge.
Can I ask you something, Kittridge?
If you're dealing with someone who's crushed, stabbed, shot and detonated five members of his own IMF team, how devastated do you think you're going to make him by marching Ma and Uncle Donald down to the county courthouse?
What are we downloading?
What kind?
You don't know what you're missing. This is the Mt. Everest of hacks.
The official apology from the Justice Department, the VIP treatment, you know, the whole nine yards.
And how might you know that?  Are you another Company man?
Ah, but, we're asking about you.
Very good.
You're not going to any meeting without me.
OK.  Taking Golitsyn's exit.  Jack, open the doors.
Oh?  What's the problem?
I guess.
Why not?
- but you left before I could get there and I could check just so many places..
You got it.
I knew about Jim.
Jim, itís over.
What's going on?
Why don't you take a look?
Too wicked to have a drink later?
Such a nice ass.
Whatís the problem.
I have my eyes open.
I don't know what you mean.
You haven't said anything.
In a month.
Mona?
At dinner, my daughter-in-law threatened to kill me. Things are very bad in my house.
Have you come from my brother?
You don't have to help me.
This is good. Uhh...
Fast.
Why?
Stupid yourself.
I'm a wolf?
To the bed.
I can't believe what is happening.
What?
This time I was trying to do everything right.
You're invited to the wedding! It's in a few weeks. Why didn't you do like him and be with your dying mother in Palermo?
Last night never happened, you hear me? I'm gonna marry him anyway and last night never happened, and you and I are gonna take this to our coffins!
This is where we're going!
I'm afraid of who I am.
What's the matter? You look crazy.
Hi Loretta.
You don't want the fish.
It's the oily fish tonight. Not before the plane ride.
Will you marry me?
You know I was married and that my husband died. But what you don't know is I think he and I had Bad Luck.
I like this ring.
What time is it?
Yeah.
Have you told her we're getting married?
Johnny, I have something to tell you.
WHAT?
No.
Will you live here?
Why not?
So we'll sell the house.
Did he tell her?
I don't wanna talk about it.
Are you drunk?
A miracle? This is modern times! There ain't supposed to be miracles any more!
Listen, I gotta go. I'll take the deposit to the bank but I'll do the books tomorrow. I gotta go.
Hi, Loretta.
We just come from the bank.
Twice I took the name of God in vain, once I slept with the brother of my fiancé, and once I bounced a check at the liquor store -- but that was really an accident.
I... a... slept with my fiancé's brother.
Don't fight.
That's it! That's the reason!
No idea.
Loretta...
I'm sure she did.
Yes?
When I was twenty-seven years old, in Jersey City, I asked a woman to marry me. She had red hair. She smelled a jasmine. She wore black shoes with pointy white tips.
Ouch. Too young! I just got that. You know how to hurt guy. How old are you?
I'm a professor. I teach communications at N.Y.U.
Yes.
I'm freezing
Look.
I mean it's that moon I was talking about at dinner.  Is he down there? No.
No, no,  It floats.   Throw her in the pond Tie weights on her.  To the pond.
Get away!
It's not a question of where he grips it,  It's a simple matter of weight - ratios ...  A five-ounce bird could not hold a a one pound coconut.
Oh!
Oh, Knights of Ni, here is your shrubbery.  May we go now?
What is that?
We shall do no such thing ... let us pass!
None shall pass.
None shall pass.
Then you shall die.
A scratch?  Your arm's off.
You are indeed brave Sir knight, but the fight is mine.
Nu!
They're nervous, sire.
What?
By what name are you known?
Look, you're a busy man ...
... make plain the last resting place of the most Holy Grail.
Where?
Behind the rabbit?
... But all the decision of that officer ...
... but a two-thirds majority ...
Come and see the violence inherent in the system. Help, help, I'm being repressed!
Good idea, O Lord!
I feel fine.
My name is Sir Robin of Camelot!
Who's that then?
I think I'll be all right to come with you, sir.
Oh dear, I didn't really mean to...
I can explain ...  I was in the forest ... riding north from Camelot ... when I got this note.
One day, lad, all this will be yours ...
I don't want land.
You fell out of the Tall Tower you creep!
Right.
Well, look er, I ...
Er ... Sir Galahad... the Chaste.
Well ... yes ... but I hadn't realised ...
They're all saying the word ...
What's he do?  Nibble your bum?
Er, That's ... That's enough music for a while, lads. It Looks as though like there's dirty work afoot.
So?
She loved him.
Come on, man, I'm telling you what you already know.
Have I seen you up in Balmoral, Mary?
Checked and locked, sir.
Mr Disraeli.  Ma'am.
Have you met Mr Lyle?  He's in sugar...?
My concern is for the reputation of the Monarchy.
But mama, the room was built expressly for that purpose.  It has been a smoking-room by tradition ever since father --
Mr. Carter, the Head Butler, sits there.
By whose authority?
Checked and locked, sir.
Then we'll have to see what can be arranged.
If I find out that you had anything to do with this, I will have you sacked.
Don't think I can't persuade her.
What brings you here?
Surely --
Was there never ambition?
She'll never understand it.
Then why do you persist in doing it?
The threat from the Irish is greatly exaggerated, I'm sure.
I was told you were in a fight.
I cannot believe you are saying this? You, who I have relied on all this time --
You are forcing me to do the very thing you know I fear most!
-- When I took you out riding, come rain or shine, because I knew it was right for you, when I kept the bairns off your back so you could have a bit of peace, when I saw you safe from home to home and you didn't even know I was there...!  All I've ever thought about is you!
You should never have gone out in such foul weather.
Forgive me, gentlemen.  I'm late.
I came as quickly as I could.
Mrs Brown.
Erysipelas.
We're expecting Brown this afternoon, ma'am.
Please make sure it does not happen again.
Lord Clarendon arrives, by invitation, at eleven o'clock, followed at twelve by a picnic in the grounds to celebrate Princess Alice's birthday. Dispatches, as usual, at two.  The Chancellor writes to say that, by happy coincidence, he will be in Cowes for the weekend.  He asks if Your Majesty might grant him an audience.
Read it.
Why not?
No-one should think themselves wiser than me!  It is not for any of the Queen's subjects to presume to tell Her Majesty when and where She should come out of mourning.  It is the Queen's sorrow that keeps her secluded!  It is Her overwhelming amount of work and responsibility, work which She feels will soon wear her out entirely!
There is one other matter.
From Princess Helena and other members of your family.
What do they want?
That's a very pretty shawl you are wearing, Alex.  Silk suits you well.  But you are not eating enough.  One must not let vanity overrule one's appetite.
Where is my son?
We vere thinking there might be tricks. You know, surprises that you'd worked into the game...
But how can it change every time?
What's her problem?
Liar.  Did you come from the city on the left, or the city on the right?
Hmmm.  He said you were going to have dinner?
Hello?
It is.
Something's happened to them.
Then leave her.
Anywhere.  We have to stop it from getting out.
You mean we learn the rules...
Virgin sacrifices?
Go outside, get your car, and meet me out front with the engine running. And make it quick, okay?
You got the schematics?
Alex...
What are you looking for?
You don't get it, do you?
You feel it?  It's different this time.
I'll take the lead and handle the physical threats.  You watch the elapsed time and look for exits.
Which way do you think Level Two is?
Go for it.
It's the wrong way!
What did he do to you?
Mom?  You're alive...
So how do I start?
So what do you think?
What do you mean "you know"?
Sort of, funny boy. If I tell him the meeting's on you're to go to the top of Beachwood Canyon. There's a corral up there where he'll be.
Will you meet with him?
Sure want to thank ya for drivin' all the way up to see me from that Beverly Hills Hotel.
Now... did you answer cause you thought that's what I wanted to hear or did you think about what I said and answer cause you truly believe that to be right?
There's sometimes a buggy. How many drivers does a buggy have?
I understand.
Yes...what is it?
... What??
Fine. I'll check out in the morning.
I guess it was your grandfather, was it ... he called me to check in, said you were on your way and for you to call when you get in. Nice man... farmer I hear.
I...
She wants to know who's staying in her apartment.
Coco...she's very nice. We went to school together.
You're really something Coco...thank you.
Thanks Coco. It'd be so embarrassing
My name is Rita.
Hi. I'm inquiring ...well, I heard a sound last night that sounded like a car crash and I want to know if there was an accident on Mulholland Drive.
Yes?
No ..........I.
It will be okay if I sleep. I need to lie down and sleep.
What's wrong?
I don't know.
Okay... but just...just to see.
Strange to be calling yourself.
"Really?"
I hope I'm back in a couple of hours. Don't drink all the coke. 
When I get back I'll have the cab waiting, so be ready to go.
I don't think...
Rita... I know what you're doing.
You're so easy.
What's  the matter now?
To Denny's? I wasn't going to say anything, but why Denny's?
You see what I mean...
Yeah, they showed me
Nice wallets.
Nope, not yet. Their fingerprints don't match up anywhere.
Yeah ... and they both use the same address.
That's it folks for the Demon Boat Ride.... Everybody off. Watch your hands and feet.
You must come in first place to move on !
I'll do the standard research and have them in by midnight, pending any unforseen problems.
What about Matt ?
Now where do we go ?
Come on, it works.
If you hadn't started boffing that weasel with an attitude, you wouldn't be here.
So you're telling me you were set up ? I knew something was wrong.
Hey ! I'm still your best chance to get out of here alive.
I do a very thorough background check. I go through police files, personel files, anything.
And you believe that ?
It wasn't my fault. I was just part of a team. I was doing my job...
Just remember, hold your breath as long as you can. Then go right over to that corner. The door will open and go in and up.
Where are we going ?
Do you know where you're going ?
Just stop it. End it here.
Apparently pretty high, we just got a new CEO last week.
Yeah a real shame.
Are you Matthew Parker ?
Kojak here is arresting me for unpaid parking tickets.
Is it over ?
An elevator ?
Issues ??? This guy has the damn subscription to every psychotic issue I've ever heard of.
I didn't think he'd make it past Scraps.
Don't.
It's my control board and I don't want it acting squirrelly because you dropped a few crumbs into the keyboard, no put the shit away.
He'll never get it right. Try the Log Ride !
What's wrong ?
Yeah, maybe.... Let's start the background checks. Let's see where they live and what kind of security systems....
Relax, son. They'll learn in time that you don't fuck with First Bank. This is the real deal and we aim to keep it strong. My Daddy always told me that Only The Strong Survive.
Of course.
Zach, how old are you, son ?
Zach my boy, I can spend your yearly salary in a blink. I have had that kind of money all of my life. If I wanted to, I could fly to Paris for the afternoon.  My father formed this company over seventy years ago. When my brother became mentally challenged, it was put in my charge. Now running a bank of this size is very stressful. I need to relax on what little down time I have. A yacht club will not quite make my blood pressure decline. Understand ?
That was rather.... disappointing.
I don't believe Ol' Bruce is having as much fun with this as he once did. He still insists on the "guests" being of the more nefarious type.
I'll bet that would be the Park run of the century !
I'm willing to bet that even the creator can't out wit his creation.
Is it as good as I hope it is ?
Yes sir. It will be the best of your collection, I assure you.
He has a phone pole sticking in his chest, I think we don't need an autopsy.
Might I ask why you no longer work for the mob ?
I had hoped you would say that. I have a proposal for you.....
Bruce has just awaken.
What is Bruce doing ?
Look he figured it out !
Look ! Look !
I don't know. Maybe we should watch the tape to be sure.
There ! There ! Did you see ! They're still alive !
Dinner at my place then ? Say, seven o'clock ?
Hello.
What an incredible view !
Well, I make good investments, I lead a double life as a secret agent.. I....I ... I have very rich parents. I have always had a lot of money.
Okay, now go under go under it ! Shoot Vader's Tie Fighter ! Get Him Get Him !
Are you okay ?
You don't have to sound so emphatic.
Hey good lookin' ! What'cha got cookin' ?
Did you see what the First Bank stock opened at ? Very impressive.
We start with the top and work our way down. We start with the high salaries and then just let the little people go. No need to make the blue collars go crazy.
Umm, where do you want this?
Where is he?? He was supposed to meet me.
This is California, anything is possible.
Put that down, I'll...I'll call the police!
Look, sergeant I know I said some things last time that I shouldn't have said at all but...
I'm sorry okay...we gotta find this guy because...he knew Vada's mom and he could tell her stuff that no one else knows.
Do you wanna be a hall monitor all your life?
I got a card from your Uncle Phil in Los Angeles today, said he went body surfing.
Do what?
Visualize a spare?
Ahh, strike, not, not bad at all. No, this talk isn't about sex, it's, well there've been a lot of changes, and I know you're upset about losing your room, but the baby's gotta go somewhere.
So you're saying...What are you saying??
Oh, is there anything else you remember, how did you propose? Was it romantic?
You were just having a fight about me. Wouldn't you like to hear my opinion?
I think that if I'm old enough to accept a new baby, and if I'm old enough to accept a new room, I'm old enough to go to California.
I already bought a ticket.
What does that mean?
I'll be back in 137 hours.
Yeah.
Okay...bye daddy, I love you.
Oh, Shell, that's ridiculous, where are my needle nosed pliers?
Well if there was an article about it I'm sure she did. She was always reading.
Never heard of him. 
Are you saying my mother had another husband?
Umm...can you come in for a minute?
Bye.  She looks a little like me when I was a little girl.
Special effects?
Do you have any pictures if her?
Would you like...eh...to have these movies?
Wait...woah...woah...wait a minute...Do you think I'm your father?
I know that.
See you? He can smell you from there.
Hi.
Vada, he was giving you an easy out so you wouldn't have to write about your mother.
All right, so when did she have you between all her acting and spying and getting caught?
What can I do for you?
I guess you have.
Vada?
Don't wake up Vada.
Thanks....
He said it was a gift.
I don't need you to be telling me to...
Vada.
Look at it this way, however bad I feel, it isn't as bad as becoming extinct in a bottomless pit of tar.
I'm not gonna break it, I just wanna see it change colors.
That's 'cause I was cursed with the Sultenfuss Bear Claws.  My hands fit.
Yeah I guess...sort of.
Oh no, we wouldn't be from the same bloodlines or anything. We'd be like two total strangers who...accidentally had relatives that got married.
Marriage can really complicate things. So, aren't you gonna say anything about my earrings?
Yeah?
...umm...Listen, I'm sorry...you had to sacrifice your entire vacation.
Muh??
She lives here too?
Sounds like you have a fear of commitment, Uncle Phil.
Well then that's not exactly dating is it.
I'd like to see his house but...I don't know if I'd have the nerve to just go up and knock on his door. I don't think I can go through with it.
He was caressing.
Yes, what kind of arrangement? I'd be very interested to know what kind of an arrangement we have.
No, the milk comes when the baby comes.
Margaret's my middle name, but everybody called her Maggie. Los Angeles, have you ever been there?
Why not now?
Let me hold him.
No it doesn't but... I...I wish it did.
Wanna play?
You're such a baby.
Danny?
Oh.. Oh.. Oh no?? Oh?
What am I doing here????? What am I doing here?
Keep your voice down!
God I guess i'll have to introduce you now.
This is Harry, Phil, Grammoo and Vada Sultenfuss...
You are perfectly healthy.
It's still available I hope?
I have a wonderful disposition, I put people right at ease.
Excuse me, what about the job?
Okay Mr. Sultenfuss, you got a deal.
You don't like it?
In lieu... &quot;instead&quot;.... No contest.
Kinda like men.
Oh, that was Phil, trying to give me advice on dating 70's women. Look I'm so out of touch, I haven't dated women in ages, not since my wife died.
Dance with me?
I'm tired of bingo, maybe we should try that drive in of yours.
You know this is gonna be my first 4th of July picnic in a long time.
Well, you were pretty great!
Yep, there they are... They always look the same every year...
Ahem.
Shelly thinks I'd be a good writer.
Dad??
Ahh, I just wanna look nice.
Well Shelly's coming over, we're gonna go together.
She likes to play bingo.
Yes..
Vada, something happened to Thomas J last night, he stepped on a beehive.
Did I kill my mother?
In the garage.
Really?
I think every time I see a climbing tree i'll think of Thomas J.
Well well well, what's going on in here?
Sure.
What do you get for that?
No. Well, guess i'll go home and finish off War &amp; Peace.
Please.
Cause she's dying.
Cause she gets scared of all those dead people in her house, and you know that saying, If you can't beat 'em, join 'em, well if she's one of them, she won't be as scared.
He must like Shelly, I never saw him hit anyone in his life.
My Dad was funny?
Who's winning?
Did you read ALL these books?
Shelly, do you think I'm pretty?
Hey, I thought I recognized you two, hi Vada.
I like my name.
I won, I won!!!
Where's Daddy?
I'm hemorrhaging.
It's okay sweetheart.
I'm gonna drive us to Liverpool.
No, I'm going home.
It doesn't work, it always stays black. 
Maybe they had a big breakfast.
It's a mosquito bite.
Your lip bleeding?
What's wrong with your eyes?
Hmmmm, interesting.
Who's that with your Dad?
What do you think it's like?
Sorry.
Hey Vada, guess what we got?
Pointing There's a beehive right there!
What do you want it for anyway?
Come on, let's go.
Uh huh.
For what?
And I'm supposed to respect your fashion tips, because you're what, a New Yorker?
Long trip.  Pretty nice of you to come.
What?
Blood oath.
You think...
He can't do that to me!
He's adored me for nine goddamn years.
There are 18,250 nights in the next 50 years...
Ben Gay.
I give.
Needing.
Digger and George are with family in the Hamptons until Monday morning.  Brevity is even more in order than usual.
You can't believe what it'd cost to bring in a temp.
What else did he tell you...
I'm excited Sports Illustrated gave him this kind of shot, he's only there a ye...
And loving him means loving all of this.
You'll always be there.  In his mind.  The perfect creature he loved for all those y...
Jesus, we're trapped!
So... one almost has to...
Your call.  You can live a lie. In a fabulous selection of Red Roof Inns.  Or you can make one desperate stab at hap...
Look at all this beautiful food, so lovingly prepared...
Yeah, well, lots of couples are imcompat...
I never want to go through this again.
If he gives you grief, I'll have him skillfully beaten, where the wounds won't show.
They both have some growing up to do.  But they're good people, they're starting with love. They've got time.
Is anybody watching?
Well, you're a little early...
Well, that's great.  You haven't really had anybody since Dingbat Jennylee...
Well, the Sox are at home.  SI's letting me do a profile on the Big Hurt.  That's Frank...
No matter how many times I leave the toilet seat up, she forgets and puts it down.
Gimme like, eight and nine off the top ten list...
Pretty amazing girl, you've got. Make that kind of sacrifice.
It's weird being the groom.  All these things Kimmy has to take care of...
Why don't you start being honest for one fucking sec...
You guys are heartless, my bride picked this out.
Big weddings are so strange.
Kim has all this stuff to do, I hardly see her.
Don't you throw up on boat?
It's no big deal, she just gave you the wrong keys that's s...
We could use... his computer, to... just E-mail those suckers right ou...
The fax is from Ben, too.  Man, it's my wedding, and my boss can't leave me alone...
Maybe tomorrow, you'll feel dif...
But the Scotch salmon was so fucking good, you decided to stay for brunch!
This is her family and her fault.
I asked you...
Thank God you were here.
You can't believe you've lost her!  Sooner or later, you'll find her, and you'll look in each other's eyes, and you'll see all that love...
I'm just thinking of how she's hurting.  Lost.  Alone.  Like her life is over.
It's not just a gag, huh?
He never mentioned that.  Neither did y...
And to m...
All of a sudden, I'm supposed to drop out of school, forget my family, forget my career, forget all the plans I had for my life...
I'm sure glad I'm hearing all this now, before it's too late!
What a sweet little picture.  Mommy and Daddy aren't losing a daughter, they're gaining a eunuch!
Reverend Dyer, this is Kimberly's somewhat butch maid of honor...
And yet here you are.  All celibate and reclusive.
You got the money?
Winifred, the kids want you home and so do I.
Barnett, please -
Barnett?
Oh, Barnett, I'm so sorry.
Oh, honey, I didn't mean to scare you.
What did you say your name was?
What do you really want?
You bet.
I guess that's why he thought you right want to help out.
How is she?
Well, how about the shopping center?
You want anything?  A drink?
What's he running for?
How much?
Where'd he ever see us?
Okay.
President?
He saw us at Tammany Hall.
Oh... Well... Have you heard from Barnett?
He got killed at a turkey shoot.
You go out in the woods and shoot targets -- Whoever shoots the most wins a live turkey
Haven's not going to talk to me.
Well, Mr. Green.
You want me to wait?
Yes, sir.
My wife and I think so, but we're family. Your family's always good or bad depending on how you look at your family. What do you do, pick or sing?
Well, don't be shy. I got the address here. Anytime you need it. Room's twenty-five dollar! a week and you can have breakfast with me if you like.
Well, I could use one, especially if I'm pregnant.
Have you seen a woman about so high?
She had on high heels?
You got a place to stay?
You in music?
Parts.
Mom?
I feel really good.
I want to get the dog off my bed.
Bye.
How long have you been with them?
Hello.
Yes. Who's this?
Who is this?
I don't know who you are.
Hello.
Oh?
You're really terrific, you know what I mean --LINNEA rolls over and faces him.
Wrong.
Thirty?
Terrific!  Who was that black guy? A friend of yours?
I'll talk to you tomorrow.
I'm forty-six. Do you like to go up or down?
You know who that is?
Hello.
I can do benefits
Well, there's a couple of girls in Printers Alley if you got any questions. I know I've seen that G- string stuff for sale someplace around.
An album.
Sorry I'm late.
Where are you going?
How's your stomach?
We just got a gold record.
No  Hell, some secretary in New York just hands it to you. Only this one kept dropping it out of the box.
Oh --
Well -- maybe. Let's see what happens here.
You want a ride into town?
Got me an audition tonight.
Hi, I'm Sueleen Gay.
Oh, why thank you.
Now this is to raise funds for someone who can help people who are less fortunate than yourself. The more you take off, you see, more money we can raise.
More or less.
Now, while I freely admit total ignorance on the subject, I have heard of Bruce Lee. And I was under the impression that Bruce Lee was one of the, if not <u>the</u> greatest fighter in the history of martial arts.
Point of fact, weren't Tim's hands registered as lethal weapons?
Thank you. Grace, there is one other thing...
What kind of pies do you have?
Well, now me and Mickey are gonna take it easy. Just enjoy each other's company, stop and smell the roses, notice the color purple, stuff like that.
Divine intervention.
Who isn't?
They've been separated since their incarceration in a couple of penitentiaries---
Who's the song bird?
Because they wouldn't give them their blessing for marriage.
...one night I was asleep, and a noise wakes me up. I thought, 'Oh shit, somebody's broken in.' I didn't own a gun, so I go into the living room with a fucking umbrella. Okay, it turned out to be nothing. God made the noise. Who knows?
Or what? You'll wound me? I can blow you in half and you know it.
Ah...fine. Let me make an adjustment here, and we'll be ready to rock 'n roll. Oh...uh, the dumbass at the donut place put a chocolate cream filled I asked for in your box.
How is it?
The episode we did on Mickey and Mallory was one of our most popular ones.
Yes.
My problem Mickey, is that you don't exactly inspire empathy. I'm all alone on this. I need your help. I want what the prison board is doing to be the focus of our follow up episode. Now I have interviews with chairman of the prison board Dewight McClusky about this issue. And I'm tellin' ya, Mickey, he looks bad. The two psychologists they used for their psychiatric kangaroo court won't talk to us, which always looks bad. I have an interview with both the judge of your trial, Bert Steinsma, and the psychologist and author, Emil Reinghold, both of which discount the notion that you're insane. You put that all together, and what the state is doing becomes obvious. But the network isn't satisfied. They feel the show needs another element. It needs you. In order to put the show on the air, I need to get an interview with you. You haven't talked to the press since your trial. Now, a few days before you get transferred to an asylum, you grant an interview on television with Wayne Gayle. We're talkin' a media event here. Every son of a bitch out the with a TV set's gonna tune in to see that. We'll make their motives so blatant, we'll shame 'em into dropping the whole thing. At least for a little while, the publicity would keep them from just giving you and Mallory lobotomies. Well, whatta ya say?
We're about ready to go here. Are you ready?
This is crazy. You can't escape like this.
Say it. Scream it. All the way out the front door and into your van. And if you stop screaming, I swear to God I'll blow your head off.
C'mon, c'mon, let's hurry this up.
Don't touch those triggers! Please. I think I've already proven that a live Wayne Gayle is much more better that a dead...Way-- Gayle. I was your passport out of jail, not Duncan Homolka. But me! I'll be your passport outta---
Let's make a little music, Colorada.
Mickey, you're wasting time!
Yeah baby.
Yes.
Only on a much grander scale.
They had us tied down during one of their house raids, you've seen the headlines, and they were taking a chainsaw to our legs before they were gonna kill us.
And then Mallory stops Mickey and says, 'Hey, these are the Brothers Hun.'
What do you think, Pitney? How much Explosives do you think that they really have in there?
Roger?
Jack, could you stay up here for a while?
How's it working, Scotty?
They passed the 'edge' along to us.
By taking away our legs. Now we have to fight harder to get ahead than anyone else you'll find in this gym. Probably the whole city. They gave us the fighting spirit. Before this happened I was content. Now I'm pissed off. Now I'm half a man and I've got to work like the devil to get whole again.
I'm the superintendent here at L.A. County Jail. Me and my deputies are who you'll be working with while you're here.
You met the kids I have working for me? Great bunch, aren't they?
Scott, genius cameraman, Roger, magician with sound. Unruly Julie, I could sooner do without my arm than Unruly Julie.
Ya know, I was.
It sure is.
Since he and his wife have been in custody, they've killed---
Phil, I'm just scared he's gonna clam up on me with all these sheriffs all over the place. They hate him. He hates them. What kinda intimacy am I gonna create with all this hate in the air. Even you and I feel it.
Three.
How 'bout that furniture plant?
It sure is.
You know, Doris - you'd make some guy a swell wife.
I hear you're tryin' to organize this place!
That's no way to talk, boy. Now we had one of them union men 'round here coupla years ago. Stirred up a lot of trouble. They're always after you colored boys.
Look, boy, we got a smooth operation here, and I aim to keep it that way. Now I got an idea you're plannin' trouble.
Yeah.
They say your dad's 'round town.
Looks like you're doin' a good job.
Don't say much, do you?
No. What you usually say, I guess.
His profession?
You know, man, that guy was trying to be friendly.
Cup of coffee.  I 'been meanin' to talk to you.
That's two bucks, Joe.
Thank you, Ma'am. That's fine.
You working?
Why d'you come out with me? You slummin' or something?
Well, that's a funny thing to say.
Yeah, and you keep not answerin', too.
I mean, you're kind of cut off, aren't you?
How come you stay 'round here?
You got more guts than me, baby. It's a no-good town.
What d'you mean?
You have some very primitive ideas, don't you?
Hell, I don't belong here. I don't know what I' been thinkin'.
Goin' to see my kid.
Your boy.
What d'you mean?
It's okay with me, baby. But how' you goin' to like it?
Hey, watch out! Guess you want a house full of pickaninnies too, huh?
Is that so?
Oh really? I thought it was pretty good.
My kids want me to teach them.
Don't, Duff.
I'm telling you, baby, maybe we better get out of here.
Day work.
Duff, I love you.
I don't think that'll happen.
Just get her drunk.
We was just leavin', fellows.
A whole lot, Frankie.
They all got families to support.
How about a drink?
What happened?
I said, I come to town with a girl.
That's the trouble with you boys! Don't listen when a man tells you something.
How often is that?
Want to come up the house? You can stay there till you get on your feet. There's no point paying a hotel.
Well, what're you going to do?
How 'you gonna live?
No, thanks. I'll take the bus.
Don't be too hard on him.
It's hard to know how to talk to the white folks these days.
Yes, the Lord's been pretty good to us. I guess you're a church man, aren't you?
I think if you tried livin' in a town like this, instead of running free and easy, you'd soon change your tune.
And since we're talking, my wife and I don't want you hanging around our daughter.
I know just how you feel, son. But believe me, you're going about it the wrong way.
Man, you won't like that back seat.
Well, if it ain't Duff!
Come on, Will.
Is she good in the hay? No point marryin' her just to find out. Is there, baby?
Beck's just put us on standby for crisis entry.
We got any shots?
Oh my God, I'm terribly sorry. Did I hurt you?
They're a bit too real for my taste. Will you excuse me for a moment?
You didn't come here to destroy Wintermute. You can to save a man you love. A man who isn't even capable of returning that love. Such a waste...
She's very striking, don't you think? Are these glasses a fashion where she comes from?
What you lookin' for, mon?
Alright. Let's talk business.
Are you sure you're up to this, Mr. Case? We could reconvene tomorrow.
What would you say if I told you we could correct your neural damage?
Then I'd ask you what your terms are.
Why'd you do it, Armitage?
I've heard about rogue A.I.'s, but there's only one guy who actually went up against one.
Sorry, bullshit. We haven't even begun and you're already jeopardising this operation.
Really? Do I get to know where I'm going? It makes packing so much easier.
Let's hope she doesn't expect me to swim upstream.
That's Lord Frederick Tessier. Owns most of Freeside. Wintermute's mainframe is centred in the Royal Family's villa.
That's nice, but we can't dodge this kind of heat for long.
You've got your orders.
Honesty. Almost as quaint a notion as your concept of good and evil.
Tell me the words.
What's inside me, Wintermute. What did your doctors do to me?
Ya learned good. So, what's happening?
Nothin'. Not a goddamn thing. What the fuck...
So be it, we cross into Babylon like a cool breeze.
Four men. Babylon soldiers.
Trajectory coordinates and a fuel ratio...  If we re-enter over Mexico, we just might make it.
What you're telling me is that I'm dead. Right?
I can't feel nothing because I am nothing.  Just playback. A ghost in the machine.
Never heard of him.
What?
Bright enough to be dangerous.
Well, it ain't exactly a bed of roses down here. We gonna run or not?
What are you talkin' about?
Fifty-seven minutes twelve seconds.
You, I presume are Mr. Armitage. And this is...
Hello, Case.
And we really do have to talk.
You know why Linda's dead. She loved you and you let her down. It's that simple. Of course I did instigate certain events. Calculated the variables. I found her to be... expendable.
Excellent. That's exactly what I had in mind. But if you're going to kill me, we have to work together, old son. I'm no pushover, you know.
His name's Armitage. He's very anxious to meet you.
I gotta know... did it work>
I'm going in.
I'll show you how to tell what's going on. If things go south, you unplug me.
When I was fifteen Sense/Net iced my old man's credit record over some computer error. Once that goes down, that's it. He lost his business... everything. It destroyed him. I had to hustle arcade games for chump change. Dixie McCoy found me, figured I was a natural. He taught me the wires for a piece of the action.
It sounds like you.
Case... it's four a.m.
Yeah... fine.
What's wrong? Don't like flying?
Le Vingtieme Siecle. We're meeting Armitage there for the midnight floor show.
He projects with neural implants.
I know.
When they did my eyes, I made them promise I'd still be able to cry. Sounds stupid, doesn't it?
I'm still going in.
Peter... What do you think you're doing?
Who?
How are you at riddles, Peter?
What?
: Because he's Guy Perkins.  Listen, you want to walk to Na- Na's and get something to eat?
What's that?
Sometimes I wonder what they talk about.
It's romantic, what you're doing, and they want to be a part of it.
No Roger from op/ed?
Now look. Let's focus. Prom theme. We need a new idea.
Okay, just so I'm clear here -- neither of you think I can do this.
So, you were a geek. Big deal.
So I was thinking about what you were saying - y'know, about really being kissed? I think Roger could be the one.
Cuuuute!
wait, rewind. Do you really think she hooked-up with our Rob? They're so--different.
You guys--what is the one thing that could ruin my senior prom?
I think it's pronounced gauche.
: Wait. Do you know any gay guys?
Hey Josie- who did Archie date Betty or Veronica?
How many times have I fired her?
A--flack jacket.
Well, the bulk of it will be about the pimento loaf--
Uhh, no.
Do you even know these kids?
Gus?
What if I say no?
And that's the best part.  "Teacher-Student Relations: How close is too close?" We're gonna blow the lid off it!
That is so--weird that you name your car.
How can you just give up like that? You had a real shot at playing college ball and you let one case of mono stop everything. Don't you want more? To move out of Mom and Dad's? Pay your own bills?
What!?
It was a long time ago -
Come on! It's not that hard. All you need is one person. Once the right person thinks you're cool, you're in. Everyone else will be too scared to question it.
Rob--thanks. For everything. This is really happening. I never thought--
No, you weren't. Don't you realize the only time I was really happy in the last five years was when I was playing ball with those guys?
Dorothy Parker--
But I think she wanted to be happy, that's why she wrote. I mean, she was still writing about love, right?
Your writing. It's amazing, Josie. You're really talented. And far less depressing than Dorothy Parker.
So what are you thinking for college?
Oh right. The Spiderman incident.
God, I would love to think I'm an interesting teacher. I mean, I had maybe one or two teachers in high school who had any passion at all.
Boys.
Maybe distant cousins. They did have that egg shape in common.
That's sad, isn't it? He had to sit on that wall all by himself. He deserved to have somebody.
Yeah. To watch the world go by.--
Our penguin, right?
No, I know, but I pulled some strings, got him to look at your writing, and he agreed to meet you.
told him  --if I'm wrong about this girl, you can take away my teaching certificate!
So--have you thought anymore about Dartmouth?
"Surprise!" you were doing a story on me?!
What? Happy? Why? Because it turns out all along that I was allowed to be attracted to you?
I told you you could write, Josie Geller.
Into our group.
You ruined the whole thing!
Hey Monty--you think we'll get any business today?
Are you having fun?
<i>                      I wish my cohorts weren't so dumb.</i>
We followed your instructions.
What trail are you trying to throw me off now?
But I have to go out. Something's happening out there.
Then we'll both starve...  An old man like me, who hardly has strength as it is -- me, without whom... me, your own father...
I know what's wrong with the air coditioning - just needs a shot of freon, is all.
That's Lisa - I gotta get to school.
I love you, Jesse.  Come back to me.
I'll kill you now.
She giving you any carfare for the ride?
So, you live around here.
What are you doing here?
The only thing trying to get into your body is female and waiting for you on a cabana floor.  And you want to sleep with me.  Go figure.
This is amazing!  Your dream told you where this was?
That's when she started talking about Fred Krueger.
Look, you got electricity in your body, right?
And heat and chemical reactions. Where does it all go when you die?
Here.
What is it?
I think I better go.  I'm just not into it tonight.  I'm sorry.
You're not being fair to me.  I'm worried about you and I want to help you get through this thing.
You created him - you can destroy him. He lives off your fear.  Fight him, Jesse!
What's so funny?
Yeah, I'm fine.  Just really hot upstairs.
I'm serious.
And you don't want to keep him waiting.
Honey, you'll wake the whole neighborhood!
I can see that. You watch too damn much TV.
Oh, right.  You're gonna be a TV star.
The city that never sleeps.  So what will you do now?
It was great seeing you again.  I'm glad you dropped by.
Have you ever done that before?  Pulled someone into your dream?
That was different.
Freddy?
Kristen, can you pull us out?
Are you okay?
So...got the keys to heaven, baby.
Max, where's Kristen?
Nothing like a little cheery news to start the day.
Well, if it isn't my little girl... come to visit her Daddy.
It's over.  It's over.
Must have opened while I was away at school.
My father an I...well, the family just seemed to fall apart.
I'm serious.
All right.  Then let's eliminate the symptom for the time being.
I used to be like them, Neil.  I know what they're going through.
Do you?  You told me they're survivors...and they are.  But how much longer they survive is up to us.
Take us there, Kristen.
We made it.  Neil, we made it!
Who would know where they were hidden?
And you won't make any progress until you can recognize your dreams for what they are.
We've got work to do.
There are times when it doesn't offer much comfort.  I've seen you before.  Sister...?
This wing's been closed for years.  What was this place?
My God.
Freddy.
She's been doing ground-breaking research on pattern nightmares.
Nothing.  They're my patients.  It's my decision.  I want the dreams stopped until we get some answers.
I'm sorry, Neil.  You brought this on yourself.
God, that's an enormous arse.
And then I... right.
That book's really not good -- just in case, you know, browsing turned to buying.  You'd be wasting your money.
I think the man who wrote it has actually been to Turkey, which helps. There's also a very amusing incident with a kebab.
Okay.  So what does 'just over the street' mean -- give it to me in yards.
Oh hi.  Forget something?
Probably best not tell anyone about this.
Oh hi.  It's William Thacker.  We, ahm I work in a bookshop.
Sorry about not ringing back.  The whole two-names concept was totally too much for my flatman's pea-sized intellect.
Right.  Ahm... the film's great... and I just wondered -- whether you ever thought of having more... horses in it?
Well, it was nice to meet you. Surreal but nice.
Too complicated.
No, I didn't.
Hi.  Can I come in?
I have thought about you.
Would you?  It's all talk, talk, talk.
'Message from command.  Would you like them to send in the HKs?'
With a goat playing a violin.
You've got big feet.
You know what they say about men with big feet?
Oh please sod off.
Oh God yes -- I'm sorry.
Her most famous part -- men went to bed with the dream -- and they didn't like it when they woke up with the reality -- do you feel that way with me?
Oh my God.  And they got a photo of you dressed like that?
And remember -- Spike owes you an expensive dinner.  Or holiday -- depending if he's got the brains to get the going rate on betrayal.
Excuse me?
Hi.
But yesterday... that actor asked you who I was... and you just dismissed me out of hand... I heard -- you had a microphone... I had headphones.
Sorry about that.
... with you, I'm in real danger.  It took like a perfect situation, apart from that foul temper of yours -- but my relatively inexperienced heart would, I fear, not recover if I was once again ... cast aside, which I would absolutely expect to be.  There are too many pictures of you everywhere, too many films.  You'd go and I'd be... well, buggered, basically.
I live in Notting Hill.  You live in Beverly Hills.  Everyone in the world knows who you are.  My mother has trouble remembering my name.
Nice one.  Would you like my phone number?
Can I just say, I thought 'Ghost' was a wonderful film.
Yes... I've always wondered what Patrick Swayze is like in real life.
Does the girl have a name?
Still loves you though.
Bernie.
But she said she wanted to go out with you?
Having you here, Anna, firmly establishes what I've long suspected, that we really are the most desperate hot of under-achievers.
Hi guys.  Oh holy fuck.
If you'd like to come with me we can rush you through the others.
Classic.  Absolutely classic. Profit from major sales push -- minus ?347.
I suppose so.
I have to disturb you when you're cooking the books, but there's a delivery.
Excuse me -- it's your mother on the phone.
You didn't know she had a boyfriend?
There's an understatement.  There are dead people on better form.
Don't give a damn about the famous girl.
Absolutely.  Never trust a vegetarian.
No, sir.
No, sir.
Can I help you?
Hey.
Who were the ones you didn't write down from?
Spike!
What he's going to say next is -- there are people starving in the Sudan.
Do you mind me not saying -- it's a rather distressing disease and the name of the hospital rather gives it away.
Bad news.
The one down your trousers.
And yet you suspect her.
No secrets, Mister Harding. Let's get it all out in the open...
Was it your idea to visit her on Sunday?
N-n-n-n-duh-duh-duh-pl-pl-pl-pl-muh muh-muh...
Yes, ma'am...
We do appreciate the way you have taken it upon yourself to meet the other patients.
Well, say, how 'bout easin' it down a bit so a man don't have to shout!
Oh, I had them removed.
Yes. Now was there anything else you wanted to discuss, Mister McMurphy?
Mister McMurphy, the purpose of this meeting is therapy. Group therapy.
Let me pose a question to the group: do any of you feel that Mister McMurphy is perhaps imposing his personal desires on you too much?
I'm proposing a re-vote on watchin' the ballgame!
You men remain seated!
Yeah, that's kind of crazy, ain't it!
Mister McMurphy.
I hope everything is settled.
No, kid, it was my own stupidity, that's what pissed me off.
What we're gonna have to do is pull this ballclub together for our next play. 'Kay!
A bus?
What is it, kid?
H-h-how's it g-g-going, Mack?
I-I-I-I-I'll g-g-g-go, M-M-Mack...
Candy? Hell no, Billy, she's just a good friend, that's all...
Shit! This is too much!  Chief, I tell you we're gonna bust outta this place an' make it all the way to Canada before they know what bit 'em.
Ya like that, Chief, huh?
Sock it to 'em, kid!
In there.
When do you think we'll be going back, Mack?
It's the questions she asks.
I'll bet a dollar.
Well, say, buddy, is that the usual pro-cedure for those Group Ther'py shindigs? Bunch of chickens at a peckin' party?
Did to me?
And if you persist in your ways, they can always ship you over to Medical Surgery.
Lobotomy!
Hell, I couldn't get it up over old hatchet-face if ya paid me!
With this thing! I'm gonna put this thing right through the window, that's how!
So why are you talking to him?
Ya owe me twenty-five bucks.
Time in!  Hold it! Time out!  I said Harding out!
I wanna see it...
Jesus God...
Gary Blinker's fulla shit!
Yeah, but you know how society persecutes a dedicated man.
Well, ya know, Doc...  Doesn't it say so there?
That's correct, Doc ...
Good, good, and how are you getting along on the ward?
Come on, Doc, you must be kiddin'.
Guidance and assistance! That's insane! Doc, ya gotta help me.
When?
Candy. Candy, over here.  Hey, Doc, time out.
Shhh. Hold it down! I'll take you guys down, but ya gotta come right back up! 'Kay?
I'll bet a buck you don't do it!
Yeah, take us back to the dumbwaiter, Mac.
Hey, how's it look up there, big boy?
You just come on with that three fifty and Martini will take care of himself... Your dice, Scanlon.
I thought I might donate it to the mess hall.
Hey, Sam, bet ya two bucks ya lose.
Ya fuckin' coon, you're not on the ward now!
Hey, Billy, stop cryin'. You don't have to cry... You ain't got nothin' to be ashamed of. She ain't gonna tell you mother... stop crying...
At this hour?
You've been drinking on the job again, haven't you, Mister Turkle!
And you haven't heard the last of this!
What?
I don't know anything about that, Miss. I would have to examine you first...
Now, Miss. What do you want with twenty zombies when you got a twenty gun salute looking you right in the face.
Excuse me?
Is he some kind of celebrity or something?
You don't think this is just infatuation, do you?
And, he's a friend of yours.  It's Dwayne.
A very large pig.
I'll bring it back as soon as I can.
You...
It was the moth stuff that gave it away, didn't it?  I knew that was too much.
Lots of history.  For example, did you know, according to legend, this coastline used to harbor Sirens?
I'm sure he'll be sorry to hear that.  Who should I tell him called?
Damon Bradley...
That's not the point.
Why can't you just tell me?
So?!  Is there something wrong with loving somebody who's safe?
So?
So.  You found him.
Well, it looks like we both lucked out.  I just met somebody myself. Somebody my aunt introduced me to.
And she's a knock-out, too.
Where are you going?  Just-- out of curiosity...
Oh, thanks.  Well, have a good time.
What?...
Well, how about those old romantic movies with those great stars, huh? Like Audrey Hepburn.
And I can't believe you are so stubborn and so blind as to let some stranger, some phantom you've never even met destroy it.
What would you call it?
Yes.  I'm crazy.  You have driven me crazy.  No one in their right mind would go to this much trouble to win over someone as insane as you.  Did it ever, even for one second, occur to you how much work it was to set all this up?  How many arrangements had to be made? How many players had to be coordinated?
I was wondering...  Do you have dinner plans?
I'll look forward to it.
Sure.
Well, to-- new friends.
What looks good?
So what do you think?
Faith, this is my mother.
So, what are we waiting for?
So, you gotta be a little flexible. Look at your brother and me. Larry's not perfect, neither am I.  But we work it out.  We're not unrealistic in our expectations, and we have each other.  I think you've got the Door Number Three Syndrome.
Just that they came out of somebody's experience is all.
I don't know.  I don't think so.
He begged me to marry him.  I didn't even want to marry him.
But what?
Let me tell you something about love.  There are no prince charmings, there are no glass slippers.  Love is hard work.
Is that bad?...
Have you seen him with someone?
Live happily ever after.
This is a Lifestyles hotel.
Maybe there's fingerprints on it?
What's that supposed to mean?...
So, what exactly is Larry's side of the story, anyway?
You think he misses me at all?
He went out and bought himself men's cologne the other day.  Did I tell you that?
Well, how come we're always looking for guys for you?
He's heeeeeerrre...
Right, right...  Okay..  You don't think he's gonna think I'm too aggressive?
Well, nobody can say we didn't try.
Hi-iii...
Sightseeing...  What're you doing?
Why?
I thought you were the one who didn't think I should've come in the first place.
Amazing...
Joan Collins stayed here.
It means you're a completely worthless excuse for a human being, and the fates have all conspired to make you miserable.
Kate is that you?
He existed.  He was some kid I knew from Little League.  He was a real jerk.  You say he's a friend of Dwayne's?
Larry, you've got to tell her.
I came after the woman I love.
I have to talk to her.
Oh, it's you.  It's only Peter.
And don't be walking off with any of that. You know how the boss feels about individual pilferage.
When he got up and chased them they thought it was a dead man coming after them.
Come on, kid. I'll buy you a drink.
We got a little extra detail for you. The local priest and this Doyle girl are getting up a meeting in the church. We'd like a rundown on it. You know, names and numbers of all the players. You're nominated.
Gee, Charley, I'm sure glad you stopped by for me. I needed to talk to you. What's it they say about blood, it's— 
A steady job and a few bucks extra, that's all I wanted.
I always figured I'd live longer without it.
What the hell!!!
Wow... .
Father Barry.
Terry...?
They play pretty rough.
You know how the Sisters are.
It isn't brains. It's how you use them.
In braids? That's right.
I'd better go in.
He had a few birds.  I got up and fed 'em this morning.
And if you don't?
I— I'd like to, Edie, but—  —there's nothin' I can do. Edie feels subdued, ashamed at breaking down. She rises, and in a low voice says—
You... .
Edie, listen to me! I want you to believe me. I want to be with you.
I know what you want me to do!
Edie.
Edie, for years we pushed quarters into a cookie jar, to keep you up there with the Sisters, and to keep you from things like I just seen out the window. My own daughter arm-in-arm with Terry Malloy. You know who Terry Malloy is?
I'm not trying to tell you he's Little Lord Fauntleroy.
You think we kept you out in Tarrytown just to have you go walkin' with a corner saloon hoodlum like Terry Malloy? Now get back to Tarrytown, before I put a strap to you.
Your gun.
Take your hands off me. What you call me?
So help me God!
I thought I recognized you. Saw you fight in St. Nick's a couple of years ago.
Never will be much too soon.
Be at the State House, Courtroom Nine, at ten o'clock tomorrow.
I wonder how long she's goin' to hang around, huh, Terry?
Hey, Terry, guess who's here... that joker from the Commission... .
H'ya, slugger, how they hangin'?
Count this.
I— I was just on my way up, Johnny.
You want to know the trouble with you? You think it makes you a big man if you can give the answers.
I'm glad what I done today, see? You give it to Joey, you give it to Nolan, you give it to Charley who was one of your own. You thought you was God Almighty instead of a cheap— conniving—good-for-nothing bum! So I'm glad what I done— you hear me? —glad what I done!
I'm getting the jitters! Let's turn back!
In there.
That's what I want to find out. We have to get help.
Can't we get out of here?
What do you mean?
I'm so frightened.
All right.  Put it on heavy.
...And what is this?
She came to us on the Day of the Dead.
Yes, yes yes I know all that.
I suppose most of the others will have to wait for their judgement until after the next full moon.
The <b>moon</b> is almost <b>gone!</b>
Oh, if there is only time!
You may take her now.
Ahh, the curiousity of youth... on the road to ruin!  May it ever be so adventurous!
Did you do something to get us into trouble again?
I said not as a rule.
Glenn Michaels.
Yes.
He didn't hurt you or anything, did he?
He called the day he escaped.
Adele?  You in there?
I'm not dressed.
I don't know where he is.
It's Richard Ripley.
Why you brought Glenn into this, I'll never know.
You're just jealous it was me in the trunk with her and not you.
I've been dreaming about a hot bath for the last six months.  Soak the prison off me.
Longer we hang around down here, Jack, better chance there is either Glenn's gonna fuck up the whole score, or we gonna get busted, or both.
And you know they're gonna have some people watching the hotel.
You at least bring the gun?
There.  You see the guy sitting on the porch?  The old ladies and one guy? You know they'll have a couple more in a car somewhere.
I guess Adele's in good hands.
Whatta you think?
Outside of that.
How long you talk to her?
No doubt the man's got some big-ass security system.
My sister believes in fate, but not hell.  That's why she stopped praying for the lost souls since you don't hear that much about purgatory anymore. But every day she asks her boss to pray I don't fuck up.  Whatta you think, you think there's a hell, Jack?
They put a gun on you, you'll go back.
Listen, I gotta get some better shoes, few other things before tomorrow.  Why don't you drop me off at the Ren Cen, we'll hook up later?
So how's that work, a wanted felon socializing with a U.S. Marshal?
Did you give her a jump?  If you did I might begin to understand where your head's at.
You find out?
So what's that mean?  That you're disappointed by what you found or you're sorry you robbed all those banks?
They want to go tonight, before Glenn gets in any trouble, opens his big mouth.
From the looks of those boys, the Ripper too.
You talked to him?
The time came, you shot him.  But you didn't shoot Foley or the guy with him.  They're unarmed, you had a shotgun and you let them throw you in the trunk. Okay, now you got your Sig in your hand.  You say in the report you couldn't turn around, he had you pinned down.  But when the trunk opened, how come you didn't cap the two guys then?
Shut up.
Yeah, I know.  I was just leaving. Why were you trying to reach me?
Sure, Daniel.
Put it down or I'll shoot.
You excited?
Yeah, but I see you moved it up.
Who?
What is it with crack and transsexuals?
How much for your company at chow?
I bet.  How much?
Himey here's a pro-toh-jay of mine. He's ranked number thirty-two in the federal prison system.
What's the matter with right here? It's nice and warm.
Who's sitting here?
The fuck you talking about?
You got two minutes, that's all.  Make up your mind.
That what they're wearing these days to break and enter?
This kind of setup, you don't have any idea what the fuck you're doing -- do you?
There isn't any.  All this shit you got in here.  What is all this stuff anyway?  Handcuffs, chains... what's this can?
Where's your gun, your pistol?
Guys like me, huh.  Well, listen, even though I've been celibate lately, I'm not gonna force myself on you.  I've never done that in my life.
That's funny.
We still talk, though.
You know who this is?
Unless you wanna tell me.
One last score, that the idea?  Move to some island.
A girl.
Having it cleaned didn't help, huh?
Not yet.  Don't say anything yet.  Okay?
Well, does it make sense to you?
If I had answered, what were you gonna say?
You really wear that suit.
You kept touching me, feeling my thigh.
So she did help you?
Come on, Jack -- don't.
You guys-- come on-- this is too heavy!
Detroit.  Snoopy Miller told me uncut diamonds are as easy to move as cash.
Looks like tonight.
Thanks for your help.
Tell me something.  What's it like, walk in a bank with a gun, stick it up?
Plus, even it was true, he'd still have to figure out where I keep 'em.
My ex-wife's in Miami.  It's nice down there.
The fish?
I can't say that I've paid that much attention to 'em before.
The <u>ninth</u>?
You must be some kinda walker, Henry.
I'll send it to you at Glades.
For the car, for aiding and abetting a prison escape, and conspiring to do whatever you came here for.
What's going on, Glenn?
But I thought the whole thing was your idea?
Why's that?
I can't really go into it right now. I'll just tell you it's someone big.
You there?
Thing I'm worried about is you.
I'm looking for a friend of mine I think Maurice knows.
Got run over by a car.
You fit another Chanel suit in here?
Can't.  I gotta drive out to Glades, then I'm meeting Ray Nicolet at ten.
How 'bout I come next Sunday and watch the Super Bowl with you?
He doesn't even look like that.
I've heard a lot about you, Mr. Sisco.
I think it's Dunn & <u>Brad</u>street.  But then, I could be wrong...
Excuse me.  Snoopy?  Did we settle the fish thing?
Well, if it isn't the Ripper hisself.
We have a problem here?
I think he must've fell in.
You good-lookin' sumbitch...don't you EVER die!
Are you sure they're here?
Do you always stutter?
You're Walker, right?
Cock-suckin' right I do!!  In the gun lockers!
I understand how it could happen.  I know why any guy would love her.  And I can't blame you that it happened.  You thought I was dead, she was grieving, you were trying to help her.
Yeah, right.  Anyway, you didn't know.
She said I was so much like you.  I said, No, I'm not.  I'm like I am because of you, but I'm not you, not as good as you. Everybody else saw me as a loser with a big chip on his shoulder.  But you saw the better part of me, the part of me that could be like you, and changed me. You made me who I am.
Maybe just trying to measure up.
It's not getting any longer.
Hey!  What is this, the planes all bunched up like that?
Lieutenant... I'm Danny Walker.  I'm Rafe McCawley's best friend.
Sorry.
Hey, have you seen Pearl Harbor at night?
And where's the secret base, Sir?  The one we t-takeoff from.
Then wh-where do we land?
Don't get smart with me, son.
Well sure, Colonel --
'Scuse me, 'Mam.  All the ship's doctors is golfing, and I couldn't find nobody to look at this.
What do you get for winning?
Thank you, 'Mam.
Colonel Doolittle pulled the strings, and put me on loan to the R.A.F.  They need pilots, and we need experience.  I leave tomorrow.
Don't worry about that.  Guys away from home, lonely, good-hearted women try to cheer them up.
Everything real except the fact that no one is shooting back at us.
Hello, Lilla!
What's Peggy Sue going to do at your lodge meeting?
It's gonna rain again. Every time I wash the car, it rains.
Hey, you're a hip chick. You look like you stepped right out of Life magazine. Any time you want to borrow it again, just ask.
After you got knocked up, my mother didn't want me to talk to you. She thought it was contagious.
They're waiting. Come on.
I'll call you Later.
Can you believe I want to marry that dork.
I'm still waiting for the mortgage check.
Are you taking Janet to the reunion tonight?
You drive like a maniac!
It's not going to be forever. I figure three years is long enough. I can see it the music pans out.  And right after graduation we should start seeing other people. Kind of comparison shop before we settle down and get married. Know what I mean?
Well, we got the prom coming up, all these parties. We shouldn't upset our parents?
I noticed you were giving me the silent treatment at lunch. I guess I deserved it. I've been thinking about my three year plan and I think it's unworkable. I must have been delirious.
I'm sorry Charlie.
What do you know about classical music?
Charlie. I just had the strangest dream.
What are you doing here?
Does this mean you like me again?
Forget it, it'll never work.
You betrayed me, Charlie. You were never there for me or the children. And now you come and tell me, "Peggy, you're scared." Of course I'm scared. If you knew what I knew you'd be scared shitless.
Come back to me.
. Peggy Sue, I love you, and I need you Peggy Sue...
I thought you were...for a while.
Charlie, I had a strange experience.  I went back to high school. And I spent a lot of time with you.  And you and Walter and Leon were singing "I Wonder Why".
Yes, sir. But that's what I like about her. She's not like all the other girls at school.
Yeah. He's so cool and mysterious.
I was impressed with what you said in English class today.
A ray of oneness piercing the solitude. Falling bodies in the ecstasy of flesh. You'll be a chapter in my memoirs of desire.
That was quite an evening. Bourgeois, phony, decadent, stupid.
Ssh. He's great.
If all the kids jumped off a bridge, would you do that too?
Yes but I was a boy. And I still had hell to pay.
I closed my Christmas club.
I wanted to apologize for this morning.
The hat business is in trouble.
Oh no!
Oh, you're both so naive.
I don't need your charity. I don't need your grandmother's jewelry or your parents money -—how could you do that?
Does everybody have to hear?
I'm excused.
My little baby. Don't try to grow up so fast.
You're looking pretty chipper this morning.
When did you start drinking coffee?
What happened to you?
And the butter.
Mom, sit down for a minute. This is so nice, all of us being together again like this.
Are you Peggy Sue Kelcher?
The only time people like Dolores used to pay any attention to me was to laugh at me or insult me. That guy, Doug Snell, who shook my hand when we walked in, he used to call me a four—eyed worm.
I have to talk to you. It's very important.
What a great kite.
I want to ask you a question.  Do you think...time travel is possible?
Sort of.
That's my own theory based on a Mexican food called the burrito. I had it once when my parents took me to Disneyland.
Well, I think time is like a burrito. Sometimes it just folds over on itself and one part touches the other.
I'd be very careful if I were you. You don' t want to fall into the clutches of some madman with plans to manipulate your brain.
You're giving me the creeps.
What're you doing?
All right, I'll work on it, I'll, do some research. But in the meantime, don't get crazy.
But you have a vision. Don't you want to help your parents?
Jogging. I was running, now I'm jogging.
It was an unfair fight. He didn't have a chance. I'm taking a real gamble. I loved him for a long, long time.
You are completely relaxed. When I count to three, you will open your eyes. One... two... three.  We'll start with something easy. What is your name?
What's the matter?
Thee facial lacerations should heal up pretty quickly. I'll give you som antibiotic cream--
What's a lunch cost these days? You want ten?
Hey! How was your first day at school?
So where're we going?
Drew, I don't remember inviting Zowie in for dinner.
I've never had anyone die before...  ...but I guess you get over it. I mean, eventually...
You ever think about running away?
I know, Mom.
Yes!
Jesus.
What's wrong with your face?
Thanks, Walter.
You're right, I probably just misfiled...
Thanks, you guys.
Why are you getting dressed?
Hold still. Shit.  The goddamn vein's clotted. We have to go the goddamn hospital, so they can change the goddamn catheter.
We're not skipping this treatment.
You're scared. You think we're near the end.
I'm not going to die.
I'm not ready to die.
Whatever.
Thanks, Charles.
I hoped the challenge would improve your performance. You could say it was a carrot.
This is my partner. We keep records of hospital visits. Nothing personal.
The law says people with disabilities cannot be terminated, so long as they can perform the duties required by their position...
Who'd you get?
Huh? Oh. Great. She's great.
One more thing, Your Honor...
No, we have to do it. But later, allright?
You survived your first gay party intact.
What?
Particularly, Charles.
Can you explain <u>why</u> you didn't?
Are you a good lawyer?
Excellent work, Joe. I thank you.
Rach.
What can I do?
In general. Do you take risks in other areas of your life?
Do men have sex with each other in that theater?
Were you aware in 1984 or 1985 that there was a fatal disease out there, called AIDS, and that you could contract it through sexual activity?
Do you need a break?
In some situations.
Miguel has not been infected. As I said, we weren't aware of AIDS, then, or how it is spread.
You've testified the lesions on your face were visible to the people you worked with, correct?
And it's your contention, that when the partners were made aware of the lesions, they jumped to the conclusion you had AIDS and fired you.
By the time I was fired, there were four lesions on my face, much bigger...
No. Have you ever felt discriminated against, at Wyant Wheeler?
Apparently, Mr. Wheeler felt they were too... "ethnic" is the word she used. She said he would like it if I wore something smaller, less garish, and... more "American."
I said my earrings <u>are</u> American. They're African-American.
The HIV virus can only be transmitted through the exchange of bodily fluids, namely blood and semen.
According to the deposition, you said you were "thrilled, impressed, overwhelmed" by the quality of Andrew Beckett's work. Do you remember saying that?
It's a long way between being overwhelmed and being satisfied. A cheeseburger may be satisfying whereas caviar and champagne and roast duck and baked Alaska for dessert might be considered overwhelming. Do you agree?
Let's put it this way, Andy: your place in the future of this firm is no longer secure.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa... do you think... ? You think <u>I'm</u>...  ... gay?
How many gays do you know?
Did I ever tell you, I hate costume parties?
Right.
Now that you mention it...
You taught him a lesson.
I've seen your television commercials. "If you or anyone you know has been injured through the fault of others... It should say, "through the <u>negligence</u> of others."
If it please Your Honor, we <u>hope</u> to settle this matter.
Andy. It seems that something has come over you, lately: A kind of... stupor, a fogginess, a lack of focus... Earth to Andy. Anybody home?
You'll be sorry, Beckett.
... interview every employee, support staff, associates, partners. Did <u>any</u> of them know Andy was sick? <u>How</u> did they know? Did he tell them? Did they notice something was wrong with his appearance? None of this information got to the managing partners. We know that. Make sure everyone else does too... And Beckett: I want to know everything about his personal life. Did he frequent those pathetic bars on Camac Street?
That's kind of... extreme, Walt. Andy's private life is none of our business.
Don't wanna miss this.
Bottle-count.
All you people are so scared of me -- an' most days, I'd take that as a compliment -- but it ain't me you gotta worry about now.
You did this? To yourself?
An' now you're worried about a repeat of history?
Riddick...was thinkin' we should make some kind of deal. Just in case, you know, this actually --
What do you see? Riddick?
Riddick? What the hell are you --
Back to the ship, huh?
Just give me your hand.
Just a suggestion, but perhaps we should flee.
Christ, you don't know what's out there!
There....
I hate to kill a beautiful theory with an ugly fact, but that sand-cat won't run at night.
Hey.
I don't need his life story. Is he really that dangerous?
Better keep moving....
So now you know.
...I don't play that...I don't play that so just try again. C'mon, Riddick, tell me a better lie....
I <u>am</u> sure. Look, murders aside, Riddick belongs in the Asshole Hall of Fame. He loves the jaw-jackin', loves making you afraid, 'cuz that's all he has. And you're playing right into --
What, you think I'm doin' this to prove something?
Little ratty-ass.
...need those cells from the crash ship. Shit, still gotta check out the hull, patch the wings --
Oh, this is a dangerous game you're playing, Johns.
Not a problem unless you're gonna make --
Smoke screen for what?
How much you weigh, Johns?
How much?
You give him the cells and the ship -- and he will leave you. He will leave you all out there to die.
I dunno. Nice breeze, wide open spaces -- you know, I'm startin' to enjoy myself out here.
I mean, I mean, chrono shows we're 22 weeks out, so gravity wasn't supposed to kick in for another 19. I mean, I mean, I mean, why did I fall <u>at all</u>?
One is all?
Has anyone seen the young one? Ali?
Where's Mr. Johns?
What're you doin'?
"God is Great," yes?
I had the impression...from the model... that the two planets were moving as one. That there would be...a lasting darkness.
So just like that. Wave your little wand and he's one of us now.
Want you to remember this moment, Riddick. The way it coulda gone and didn't.
Here's the deal. You work without the chains, without the bit -- without the shivs. You help us get off this rock....
Are you fuckin' kidding me?
Look, it's hellified stuff -- but no different than those battlefield doctors when they have to decide who lives and who dies. It's called "triage," okay?
What's one more to you? Like <u>this</u> is the one that sends you to Hell?
Cornelius, if you have a moment today, I'd like to discuss this expedition of yours in more detail.
Dr. Zaius --
How did you know we'd come here?
I ask you to reconsider the rash course you've taken. If you're convicted of heresy, the most you'll get is two years. But if you persist in pointing guns in my direction, you'll hang for high treason.
I apologize.
Well, Taylor -- we're all fugitives now.
Nothing much. The remnants of a life raft. Maybe a small flag. The emblem of my countrymen.
They can't convict us of that. You proved our innocence. Besides...  ... his culture is our culture.
Look -- she remembers.
Now, just a minute --
Don't be foolish. If it's true, they'll have to accept it.
'I am not a missing link.'
We'd better get started. If the mounted police pick up our trail, they'll come this far at least.
Got your sensors?
Nothing will grow here .... there's just a trace of hydrocarbons, and most of the nitrogen is locked into nitrates.
Taylor -- quit riding him.
Will he live?
Objection. The accused is indeed a man. Therefore, he has no rights under ape law.
He can reason? With the Tribunal's permission, let me expose this hoax by direct examination.
You could get hurt doing that, Doctor.
Did you see that? It's remarkable!
Landon! Send a last signal.
It's no use ... there she goes.
Gone.
Well? Where are we? Have any notion, skipper?
All right --
Straighten me out on something. Why did you come along at all? You volunteered. Why?  I'll tell you. They nominated you for the Big One and you couldn't turn it down. Not without losing your All-American standing
We got off at the wrong stop.
Lucius.
That's the boy. Keep 'em flying.
One is in a museum!
Sustained. In all fairness, Dr. Zira, you must admit the accused is a nonape, and therefore has no rights under ape law.
I admit that where there's one mutant there's probably another. And another. A nest of them. Where's your nest, Taylor? Where are your women?
If you are protecting others of your kind, it will cost you your identity.
What is your proposal?
I don't say he was a man like an Earthman, but I'd call him a close relative, for he was plagued by most of man's ills.  Yet, fragile as he was, he came before you -- and was superior to you.
Then answer this: If ran was superior, why didn't he survive?
Speak! Go on.	Speak again.
Where have you been? Why didn't you come to see me?
It's him...Landon.
Listen-
Cornelius and I have been indicted for heresy. Unless we can prove our theories, we don't stand a chance of acquittal.
Are you going to take her with you?
What's the diagnosis, doctor? A touch of the sun?
Taylor, please -- don't treat him that way.
Would you like to come along?
Dr. Zira, I'd like to kiss you good-bye.
Go with God, Taylor.  That's an old expression. it comes from both ape and man.
How sad. Stuffed and mounted, eh? Dead men, like sunken ships, can tell no stories. And his other companion?
But suppose you find nothing but a wasteland. How will you survive?
Elias - you take your squad and I'll take Tex and Francis from your squad.  We move out in two-zero mikes. 
Where the fuck is red platoon! Tell 'em to get their asses up here! What the fuck you doin' back here Elias? Round up your assholes and move 'em up front, we're getting chopped to shit.
Youse a pig man. I hope Manny get dat laundry gig for' you do.
Hey Taylor, you don't know it but I saved your ass today. I killed a shit-eating dog. 
Come on you can do better than that!
You lame Taylor?
Taylor - get your ass over here. Move!
Shit boy you been out in the sun too long. You try that, he'll stick it right back up your ass with a candle on it.
Fuck this shit!
Where's Lerner?
...beautiful night.
Oh shit! Sometimes there's things in my head... man. Grass does that to me, fucks me all up like a crazy Indian...
Three years, Jesus, he's crazy as Barnes...
Must be somebody?
...Motherfuckah, motherfuckah, I'm too short to be dealing with this shit! They keep fucking with us man, no letup...
Tell Six we need engineers here, this pos. is crawling with traps.
Alright, Six says torch this place! Blow the weapons in place. Round up all suspected Vee Cees and shake it up! We ain't got much light left.
Sounds pretty far out to me 'Lias.
Whew! - where that come from?
He done a year in Japan in the hospital, then when he gets out, the first thing he done is re-up. Four years he been in the field...
The Good Lord works his revenge in strange ways.
Tennessee someplace. Hill country.
Begging your pardon Lieutenant but my holes are far enuff apart you could run a regiment through there and nobody'd see them - I got five live bodies left...
Hey Lieutenant I didn't ask for this job, I...
No thanks, I've seen Seattle.
You could tell me your name. And where you're going.
Suppose I hadn't known that immigration inspector? Hadn't put in a good word for you?
What's the matter?
Betty, this is Margo West. She wants to meet you. Miss Mayfield.
I don't like being referred to as babe, or addressed as baby. I don't like your possessive attitude, nor your hints of secret knowledge. In fact, to be very frank, Mr. Mitchell, I don't think I like you.
I think you're drunk.
What's the matter, baby? Don't you like being kissed?
Good evening, Miss.
I'm Mr. Campbell, Miss Mayfield.  Purely as a matter of routine, I want to ask the name of your bank.
You can have the table yourself, if you'd rather. I'm only killing time.
A fellow named Brandon has a penthouse here. He's holding open house. I was up there. Too noisy. Bored.
It's open-house. No crashing involved. Anybody in the hotel's welcome.
You're not paying for this. It's quite enough that you let me sit at your table.
Would it make you anymore amusing?
I didn't say anything.
Dance?
There isn't one.. That anyone would believe. I went for a walk after dinner, down to the ocean...alone... I came up and went to bed. I didn't sleep very well. Then there was a thunderstorm. And it began to rain. I went across to close the French door. That's the first time I saw him out there.
How did you meet him?
Go ahead...if you want to. It doesn't matter.
Dance? Tonight?
Certainly not to me.
He's not a cop. A cop wouldn't have kneed me.
Why?
It still doesn't matter if I kiss you?
That's the second round I've lost tonight.  That fellow hurt me.
Cant be too close for me.  Right across the street from it suits me.  Anything else listed?
There's a lot of water between Vancouver and the U.S.A. This note is a suicide note.  After you're gone where would they look for you?  Why would they look for you? Darkness, and open water, and a fast cabin cruiser.  And I have a pocket full of money.  And if I helped you, I'd be committing a crime, or so they tell me.
Take me where I haven't the courage to take myself.
You'll be safe here.  I won't be long.  Help yourself to anything you want. The galley's through there.  You can make coffee if you like.
Well?
Including Killaine...I still can't think of you that way.
Not this one.  And not Mitchell.
That's an evasion and you know it.
FLorida?
You won't tell me who you are? You won't even give me a chance to help you?
This isn't a very good place to talk.
You wouldn't even try  There must be some copper in you, or you wouldn't be an inspector.
I'm about to be very silly.  A man passes a girl on the street--a very lovely girl--his eyes meet her eyes, and something reaches out and takes hold of his heart-- and then she goes on and is lost in the crowd--and he says to himself, "There goes my lost love"-- and it's true--if he never sees her again, it's still true.  Of course, after a while, he forgets-- or almost forgets--because after a while we forget almost everything.  But this man is a copper.  He gets orders--routine orders--to go to a place and investigate a murder-- and everything points to a certain girl.
He looks at the girl, looks into her eyes--
Not quiet yet.  We know who the gun belonged to. Margo West.  She told us this morning.  It doesn't mean much.  Mitchell took it away from her.  He had a habit of going through her bag.
That's something I can't spare you.  But I won't do it myself.
You've got a couple of hours, maybe.
I can't answer that.
What are you going to do--toss your job into Puget Sound?  Because I make you think of magnolias?  I thought policeman was something like a soldier.  That his duty came first.  However much he might happen hate it.
No, Jeff.  You don't.  He's not a murderer, I tell you.  He;s not a murderer.
And there's a Mr. Goble to see you. Says his business is personal.
I don't like your perfume in my office. Make it somewhere else if you don't like Charlie's.
Let me introduce you. Mr.  Killaine, Mrs. West.
Who told you my name?
How are your teeth getting along?
What's this in favor of?
That's what I like about cocktail parties. Everyone is so perfectly natural.
Thank you.
Could be.
Time for a little chat?
Thanks.  Lovely view you have, haven't you?
I have a warrant for her arrest.
You forgetting the gag line, Killaine.  The police don't take anything for granted.
I had a father who knew how to steal.
Want to walk out... or get thrown out?
I'm getting positively haggard. In a couple of years people will be describing me as well preserved.
What are you doing here?
Passkey?
Don't be a fool. I loved him. He wasn't worth it, but I loved him.
You nasty, sardonic--
I'm a very observant man. You had something in your bag this afternoon, Something that causes you to hold it in a particular way. Something that made a particular sound when you put it down on the bar. You went out with Mitchell. None of us ever saw him again.
Nastiness. You're nasty with words. Why wouldn't you be nasty with deeds once in a while? You hated him--and I know why.
The Harbor police have just picked up a dead man out of the water.
We've done that.  He's a San Francisco private eye.  Name Martin J. Goble, G-O-B-L-E.  Had initials in his hat and for once he lived where he bought it.  Goble and Greer is the firm name.
I have an appointment with him, right here, right now.
Mr. Brandon couldn't be here.  He might have left something for you. What would it look like?
I knew him. He was easy to dislike, poor chap.
Pearl-handled .25 Automatic, uh?  No, it's a Belgian gun... 6.6 mm.
This make of gun throws a shell backwards, high, and to the right. The chaise is only about four feet from the wall.
She didn't seem the type to lam out--even if she got the chance. That stuff was all gone through last night.  Anything special you're looking for, Inspector?
Exactly.  Now I'm the killer.  And there's something I don't want you to know.  Something that would destroy my comfortable life, rob me of my friends, my position.
This is the shell.  What about the gun?
How did he know he'd get the chance? He couldn't have arranged it.
Scotch and plain water, I think.
I never saw it before.
I am a fool.
Yes--and he's already becoming vague to me.  Funny!  Last night I was furiously jealous.  Jealous of what?  I out that gun in my bag deliberately.  Who was I going to kill with it?  A girl I didn't even know?  A man I knew to be a thief and a forger?  A half-man? A gigolo?  It's already ludicrous. Love!  What a comedy!
At first, it doesn't hurt at all. That's shock.  Then it hurts terribly--you wouldn't believe such pain could exist--and six months later you can't remember what pain felt like.  It hasn't taken six months this time.  It hasn't even taken twenty- four hours.  Is that a beastly thing to say?
Yes, I think so.  Here are two glazed manila envelopes.  One is the bag type.  The other one had the money in it.  Don't ask me how I know.  I know.
This gun permit was issued to Clark Brandon?
Are you a policeman or a soft-headed nincompoop?
And in the meantime this girl goes where she pleases, does what she pleases?
But you still think she's innocent.
You shouldn't. You washed me up very thoroughly.
I don't. My hunch is she's just torn up an unhappy marriage. I was able to do her a small favor.
I hoped to get enough to cover them before they cleared. I wasn't lucky.
It's the only pose I have left. I'm sunk. Broke. I don't even have my hotel bill.
It's against the law to cross the border with a gun. The Canadian police might like to know about this.
Here I am lecturing you.  Have some pâté.
I do worry about Susan.  Have you known her long?  She hasn't mentioned you.
Then I began to listen to what the well-off were saying about the poor now — the war had just ended, and the language was much the same as it had been before the first Reform Act.  A small minority thought that England was really theirs, they had made it, they owned it.  The rest, the wage earners, were foreigners, outsiders intent on wrecking it all.
Charles!  I didn't know you were back.  Have a good holiday?
How's Mary?
Congratulations.  Who with?
Can I give you a lift?
I thought it was tremendous.
Damn.  They're early.
You don't trust me.
He's making plans for Brighton. He thought we could travel down together.
Shall we have a drink or something?
We don't seem to get much time to talk.
Not yet you know any of these people?
C'mon.  I don't want any Jones about this.
You approve!
You're so hard.  All right then. I was chatting to some people from the diary page, and the name of Barrington came up.  I expressed an interest...
...an innocent interest, and found out that last year Vogue ran a series called 'Mothers and Daughters' Number seven, Anne and Susan Barrington.  Being a decent loving friend I went to the files and made a copy for you.
Fortunate that I was here to keep Susan entertained.
Still in love?
Big mistake, I think.  You might have learned a lot.
It might have worked.  Really.  I would have been delighted for you if it had.  But she wasn't interested.  Not my fault.
I'm waiting for your mother.
Okay, I will.
What period?
I'm sorry about Saturday, Dad.  It was just impossible to get away.
And Joe Ramage - do you remember him?  He comes and helps out in the shop.
Darling Susan.  You look like an angel.  But where's your hat?
Ah, Susy, it...
Don't you gamble?
I've watched you once or twice.  You surf like it's some kind of street fight.  You jerk along from moment to moment, fighting everything that comes at you.  Always trying to win.
Don't screw around man, pull it!
One thousand feet.  Pull the goddamn cord!
Bodhi, this is your wake up call, man -- I... am... an... Eff... Bee... Eye... Agent!!
You gotta tell me where she is.
Go on, Johnny.  Pull it.  But you gotta drop the gun, first!  Right?! You use your other hand what you gonna hold on with?
This is us.  Bank Robbery.  And you're in the bank-robbery capital of the world--
Special Agent Utah, this is not some job flippin' burgers at the drive-in. Yes, the surfboard bothers me.  Yes, your approach to this case bothers me.  And yes, you bother me.  You two have produced squat in the last two weeks, during which time the Ex- Presidents have robbed two more banks!!  Do you have anything even remotely interesting to tell me?
Three men dead.  One of them a cop. How's that sit in your gut, Utah?
Pappas.  Angelo Pappas.
Candle wax.  Car wax.  Mustache wax? Could be anything.  Guy's waxing his mustache at the beach.  Gets sand in it.  Wipes it off with a shoe.  Shoe scuffs the counter.
The beaches are always being closed because of waste spills, right?  And surfers are territorial.  They stick mostly to certain breaks.  If we can get some hair samples, and get a match to a certain beach, we'd know which break the Ex-Presidents surf. You buyin' this?
No, but there are four guys back there you might check out.
... so I started tailing him.
Bodhi, yeah.  I'm on him all day, right.  He goes here, he goes there, he goes to Tower Records and buys come CDs, he has lunch at Patrick's Road House...  ... he goes into the Assured Trust Savings and Loan.
They're on their way to Maui.
I say we call it in.  Get some backup.  But you gotta do it.  Harp won't listen to me.
The hell are they?!
I know where they're going.
I mean, what do you want?  What are you doing hanging around here.
Meaning you were expendable.
Look at you.
Ouch.
Jesus Christ, Johnny -- you've been using me!  Your jacket's on the floor in the bathroom -- this goddamn thing's half out of the pocket... Oh God, it's all part of some case, isn't it?
Wasn't my style. We're a rescue unit, not assassins.  This must be good. Big shot from the CIA, leaves his desk to come back to the bush. What's so important?
Why us?
I can accept that, it comes with the job.
He'll be looking for the trip wires. If we're lucky, he won't see this.
Thanks.
Any sign of the hostages?
What's got Billy so spooked?
Put him in his poncho and liner and carry him back. We'll bury him in the morning.
What have you got in mind, General.
You lift off in three hours.  There's one other thing.
Mmmnnn...?
What in God's name...?
Georgia.
Well... I might be going out to dinner.
Mr. Harris, we know you've purchased at least twenty percent of our stock.  We also know you plan to file a formal bid for a majority share.
Do what you have to do.  I don't take it personally.
You don't know anything about me.
You'd be initiating a financial battle you'd ultimately lose, Mr. Harris.
<u>Ho</u>tel.
Regent Beverly Wilshire.  I bet you know it.
You like being a hooker, Vivian?
For the whole night?
What's your name, lover.
You may feel more comfortable. This is not the kind of place that rents rooms by the hour.
You really are a very beautiful girl.
Did you sleep well?
Where'd you go?
Do you ever... enjoy it?
Assets are anything of value a company owns.  Sometimes the pieces are worth more than the whole.  By selling them off, I make a profit.
Not... quite.
Where'd you learn to do this?
Four thousand.
You liked the guy, though.
Know what we're gonna do in a little while then?  We're gonna call Domino's and have'm deliver a bigass pizza.  We're gonna eat it in bed.  We're gonna veg' out and watch television.
Wait till you see what I have on underneath.
You always been rich?
Keep talkin'.  I like hearin'.
You're really pushing it, bringing me here.
Real genuine guy.
Edward, these women here, I don't think any of'm like the guys they're with.  They're just into it for the money.
I thought I was the pro.  These women make me feel like an amateur.
Well, it's true.  Just pay me what you owe me and I'm gone.
What if someone tries to steal it?
If it's in Italian, how will I know what they're saying?
If you'd gone on about how much you liked it, I'm not sure I'd have believed you.
I've never treated you like a whore.
Business.
Mr. Harris, a guest of yours, is a guest of ours and shall be treated accordingly.  The young lady asked me to tell you that she is waiting for you in the lounge.
Cynthia's not coming?
Bill, we're businessmen, not the damn mafia.  I'll see you in the office.  By the way, about your car...
Edward, did you hear me?
What!?
What time's diner tonight?
I want the treatment plant licenses to be top priority right now.
Come on, you can tell me.  I sure would like to know where a guy runs into a girl as attractive as this.
And you just happened to run into her.  Great.  What's she do?  She work?
Oh, my god... Edward, no!
Edward, we've been together ten years.
Carlos had some great rock.
Looks slow tonight.
'Lo.
It was great.
He wants to set me up in a place, give me some money.
Cool your jets a second.  Here's some money.
Don't give me that.  Kit gave it to you yesterday, cash.
Housekeeping.  I come to turn down the bed.  5:00, I turn down the bed.
Is that all?  You just fold back the bedspread?
I'm -- I'm with a friend.
I think you'll find it normal enough.
In fifteen minutes I can teach you everything you need to know to dine with the Queen.  First, as you pick up the knife you shift your fork to the left hand.
Either you're European or badly brought up.
They will serve salad.
Then you would use your--
Miss Vivian --
Look I just wanted to say goodbye.
Yeah, well, I check out today.
Come on, Barney, you and me live in the real world.  You don't know how to treat a girl like anything but a lady, Mr. Thomas.
What is with you?
Get out!
If we surrender, and I return with you, will you promise not to hurt this man?
You never sent the ships. Don't bother lying. It doesn't matter. Westley will come for me anyway.
I killed him myself.
And what is that worth, the promise of a woman? You're very funny, Highness.
He knows I do not love him.
Rest, Highness.
You can die slowly cut into a thousand pieces.
Does it bother you to hear?
Farm boy. Polish my horse's saddle. I want to see my face shining in it by morning.
But how can you be sure?
We'll never survive.
I mean, what are the three terrors of the Fire Swamp? One, the flame spurts. No problem. There's a popping sound preceding each, we can avoid that. Two, the Lightning Sand. But you were clever enough to discover what that looks like, so in the future we can avoid that too.
I got married. I didn't want to. It all happened so fast.
What?
It's fabric from the uniform of an Army officer of Guilder.
I've hired you to help me start a war. That's a prestigious line of work with a long and glorious tradition.
No more rhymes now, I mean it.
Give her to me.  Catch up with us quickly.
Probably he means no harm.
Oh, you've a great gift for rhyme.
I don't think more than ten.
Where did we put that wheelbarrow the Albino had?
Ah, but how will you capture us? We know the secrets of the Fire Swamp. We can live there quite happily for some time. So, whenever you feel like dying, feel free to visit.
A technicality that will shortly be remedied. But first things first. To the death.
I could never cause you grief; consider our wedding off.  You returned this Westley to his ship?
Your Princess is really a winning creature. A trifle simple, perhaps, but her appeal is undeniable.
Your guess is as good as mine --
Well, why didn't you list that among our assets in the first place? What I wouldn't give for a holocaust cloak.
-- yes --
Look, I'm retired. And besides, why would you want someone the King's stinking son fired? I might kill whoever you wanted me to miracle.
Now, mostly dead is slightly alive. Now, all dead...well, with all dead, there's usually only one thing that you can do.
Thank you for everything.
Slow going?
But I promise I will not kill you until you reach the top.
Do you always begin conversations this way?
You are wonderful!
Kill me quickly.
Go in, get after her!
Well, it's the only way I can be satisfied. If I use my right -- tch -- over too quickly.
I accept.
Now, a clever man would put the poison into his own goblet, because he would know that only a great fool would reach for what he was given. I'm not a great fool, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you. But you must have known I was not a great fool; you would have counted on it, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me.
Not remotely. Because iocane comes from Australia, as everyone knows. And Australia is entirely peopled with criminals. And criminals are used to having people not trust them, as you are not trusted by me. So I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you.
Then make your choice.
-- get back, witch --
You are sick, that's why he's here.
Please, please, that's what we're here for.  Be careful, that hurt.
"He's gonna croon love's tune,
All right.  Get a hold of yourself. Take a deep breath, let it out slowly and tell me who you are.
You have exactly ten seconds to change that disgusting look of pity into one of enormous respect.  One ... Two ...
Look at that.  A white Rolls Royce. That's it baby, when you got it, flaunt it.
Go!  You have fifty-eight seconds.
It makes a great deal of difference. That's fraud.  If they found out, you could go to prison.
Yes, it's quite possible.
What do you mean?
What did I do?
See?  You could have raised a million dollars, put on a sixty thousand dollar flop and kept the rest.
Oh, you'd go to jail.  If the play were a hit, you'd have to pay off the backers, and with so many backers there could never be enough profits to go around, get it?
Oh, I fell on my keys.  I've got to get out of here.
Good.  Good.  That's nice.  That's very nice.  I think I'm coming out of it now.  Yes.  Yes.  I'm definitely coming out of it.  Thank you for smiling.  It helped a great deal.
Much, thank you.  But I am a little lightheaded.  Maybe I should eat something.  Hysterics have a way of severely depleting one's blood sugar, you know.
Where would you like to eat?
You can't feel it when it's in your hand, when it's in your pocket.
I'll tell you what's happening. We've struck gold.  Not fool's gold, but real gold.  The mother lode.  The mother lode.  The mother of them all.
Max, I don't want to take any Siegfried Oath.  I don't know what it is, but I don't want to take it. We might end up in the German Army.
Mrs. Alma Wentworth.  She owns 100% of the profits.
Well, I... Well, it's just that... I'm sorry I called you fat, fat, fat.
Vhy do you persecute me?  My papers are in order.  I love my country.  "Oh, beautiful for spacious skies, For amber vaves of grain."
Vat about it?
Oh, sure.  I used to take him his hot milk and his opium.  Achhh, those were the days.  Vat good times ve had.  Dinner parties vit lovely ladies and gentlemen, singing und dancing.  You know, not many people knew about it, but the Fuhrer vas a terrific dancer.
Wait.  No.  How do I know I can trust you?  How do I know you vill present this play in the manner and spirit in vhich it vas conceived?
Vhere?  Vhere?... oh...
Don't forget the checkee.  Can't produce playees without checkees.
So, the Count hired you this morning, Rudolfo ... Watch the road ... Watch the road.
Til Thursday, my Darling, I shall count the minutes.
Smasheroo.  Smasheroo.
I need it.  How'm I gonna find the fuse?
Oh, in show business.  Well, let's put it this way, my next job will be my debut.
Hey, man, I can't do that here, that's what they put me away for.
Who can we attack?  They're all too big.
He's the only cat left that still grooves me.
I don't really forget the sign, it just doesn't seem... any use.  This used to be the main highway.  Want to register, please?
The following morning. Sunday.
No! Of all...
I don't know what you expect me to know about... people come and go...
I live there. Alone.
Of course not.
I'm not a fool! And I'm not capable of being fooled! Not even by women!
Sick of the sight of it!  Well, suppose you look around for something that strikes your eyes and meanwhile I'll have my mechanic give yours the once over and... want some coffee? I was just about...
You mean you don't want the usual day and a half to think it over?  You are in a hurry! Somebody chasin' you?
I take it... you can prove that car's yours... I mean, out of state and all... got your pink slip and your...
Were there any calls?
Will you help us? I think something's wrong out there!
She stole some money.
Forty thousand dollars.
He didn't mention the money.  What he said on the phone isn't important, is it?  He was supposed to come back after he spoke to the mother, and he didn't! That's what I want you to do something about!
Please!
Well what do you think, we eloped or something? Or we're living in sin and...
I feel better when you feel better.
You want to run out there, bust in on Arbogast and the sick old lady, shake her up and maybe spoil everything Arbogast's been building for the last three hours.
That wouldn't be a wise thing to do.
Arbogast said...
He didn't come back here?
No Arbogast. No Bates. And only the old lady at home...  A sick old lady unable to answer the door... or unwilling.
Let's go see Al Chambers.
We have to go into that cabin and search it, Sam... no matter what we're afraid of finding and no matter how much it may hurt.
Sam, if you owned a useless business like this motel... one you probably couldn't even sell...  what would you need to get away, to start a new business, somewhere else?  Forty thousand dollars?
You can't go up there.
I've heard of married couples who deliberately spend occasional nights in cheap hotels. They say it...
The only girlish thing you have lost.
You can't laugh at it, huh?
Mary, whenever it's possible, tax- deductible or not, I want to see deductible you. And under any conditions.  Even respectability.
I'm fed up with sweating for people who aren't there. I sweat to pay off my father's debts... and he's in his grave... I sweat to pay my ex-wife alimony, and she's living on the other side of the world somewhere.
Hey, we can leave together can't we?
Dirty night.
Stuffy in here.  Well... the mattress is soft and there're hangers in the closet and... stationary with "Bates' Motel" printed on it in case you want to make your friends back home envious... and... the... over there.... 
You eat like a bird.
I'm looking for a private island.
Sometimes we deliberately step into those traps.
Why don't you go away?
An Institution? A madhouse?  People always call a madhouse "someplace."  Put her in Someplace!
What do you mean about caring?  Have you ever seen one of those places? Inside? Laughing and tears and cruel eyes studying you... and my mother there?  Why? has she harmed you? She's as harmless as... one of these stuffed birds.
You're not going to... to your room already?
Is there?
In the course of my duty, I never "take up" anyone's time, whether it's to give a warning, or a ticket, or help! Believe that, M'am.  Now if you woke up on the wrong side of... the car seat, that's one thing. But when you act as if I've just placed you under arrest...
Wait a minute!
Mary is Lila's sister?
Bates' Motel.  He has a mind like a mechanical brain and the more information you feed it... Go on, Sam.
You mean that old woman I saw sittin' in the window wasn't Norman Bates' mother?
Why don't you call Norman and let him say just what happened, if he give the man a hot lead and he did just scooted off... it'll make the girl feel better, Albert.
Looking for me?
My mother is not dead!
Buy a new one! In a new town! Where you won't have to hide your mother!
And then what? After supper, music? Whispers?
They thought she'd be coming to me.
No mother.
Said &quot;doctor&quot;--[something]
So--friendly or otherwise--?
Then you knew of the inheritance?
Ha ha, <U>you</U> have been treating.
That's what I said. Now, lis- ten to me. I want you to help me take this woman down stairs. I will give her a shot. You can take care of her till I get help.
What made you steal? Are you hungry?
It may be, but to my notion, those that monkeys with what they got no business to get queer sooner or later.
How do you do.
Dr. Meirschultz, please.
What is it?
There's no child here, and no dogs either.
Yes, why?
What are you laughing at?
I don't see any big-moneyed boys running after you.
I don't have any affairs. What do you mean?
If you're going to be indiscreet, I wish you'd be a little more discreet about it. Rich men, like Winton, love you and leave you.
She thinks it's funny to talk the way she does, but--
What! What are you talking about?
I'm through clowning. You're all washed up. Get out!
Well, ain't that a shame. Nice little chappie that wouldn't harm a fly ... everybody picking on the little fellow.
Whooey -- he took a run-out powder.
Hey, come here, Sob-sister!
All right, you poor baboon, you can guess the rest of it!
What!
What do you mean?
Say, you're always razzing everything I do, but this is one time I'm in.
Was there any art on Judge Ramsey?
Yes, sir. I got in the cab and it was layin' there on the floor.
I don't remember. Not so very far--
You didn't happen to be going to Worth's place, did you?
You used to go to Worth's place a whole lot. What makes you sure it wasn't there?
Call the Homicide Squad!
Nix, Flo -- he won't let you in and you'll only get me in Dutch.
Listen, kid. You're in a tough spot, and you can make it a whole lot easier for yourself if you cut out the cry-baby stuff --
That happens to be the truth.
It will always afford me great pleasure to see you. 
Fire insurance!
You've got to permit it! Whose fault is it that no one comes here? The museum at Walston Lane does well enough, and why? They've got Jack the Ripper, Burke and Hare, the Mad Butcher, the Demon Barber of Fleet Street and things people pay to see.
If my curiosity is not too great, would you mind telling me what manner of animal this is you are designing?
To lunch.
I will only be gone about half an hour.
I wouldn't feel too disappointed at the slimness of your audience tonight, Mr. Igor. The weather was against you, and the people are tired and getting over their celebration and preparing to go to work tomorrow.
Have you got it? Is it completed?
She is the soul of that statue.
What are you laughing at?
Don't waste it Pauly.  This is not an everyday talk.  Just input the information and ask relevant questions.  One: how did a celebrated life of the mind bring me  to this particular switching station?
Two: what if I didn't miss?
Why am I doing this?
Of what?
No.  I didn't.   I'm listening.
Oh, Mother, not the castor oil.
No, I'm awake. What's the matter?
Promise not to tell Doll? -- or nobody? Buddy, it's your Daddy! I'm so much in love with him I am out of my mind!
Well, I thought they were more like a cantaloupe.
Rose, can't I see what the nipple on it is like?
Just for a second. Please, Rose, what's the harm?
Well, are you satisfied now? Can we just lie and talk, huh?
All right, that's enough.  You're just a child and wouldn't understand it, but that type of thing can stir a girl up. Now lie back and we'll talk.
There ain't none in your Daddy. You know, what happened has just made me love him all the more. I not only love him, I respect him, I admire him.
Why, Buddy, shut your mouth! What an awful thing to say, and where did you get any such idea as that, anyhow?
You better quit that.
Here comes Daddy.
You don't know the bedside manner that man has got. Why, it does me good just to see him sit there all solemn and go pokin' in his bag like he's gonna cure me, which he did of course. And even more important he loves me, like a patient I mean, the other day he got tears in his eyes just listenin' to my heart beat.
I gotta find out what they're saying. You lie back and rest, Rose, and I'll give you a report on it.
Neither do I.
He did lie, and... and... and Mother, yesterday he stole money out of your pocketbook!
Of course not!
Is that Doctor still up there, Brother.
What do you think, Brother?
See, son? The paint is flaked off here, freshly. Look at it, Brother, there is no question about it. Some person or persons unknown have very recently tampered with this ladder.
Brother, when I have to wake you up at eleven o'clock in the morning you're either sick or you were up very late last night.  And you weren't reading Huckleberry Finn. I looked and its not in your room. Now what were you doing?
Uhhh, gahdam stuff!
I said ahhh-dam stuff.
Yeah.
I think she's gonna kiss him.
Buddy, that was pretty snotty of you, pushing me away like that just when it was interesting.
So am I.
What's happening?
A baby... and she isn't even married.
Well, you rascal, where'd you come from?
How could that be, son?
The pitiful son of a bitch said Rose was a nymphomaniac.
You know, I don't know this town any more. All this traffic, new buildings, prosperity...  Where have the years gone, Daddy? Where is the little town I knew as a boy?
It always gives me a funny feeling to come home. Dear old Southland. Gone. It's all gone, Daddy --  -- except you, you're still here.
Dead, Rose is dead? You mean... she died?
I am ahead of you.
It isn't the fourth dimension. To you it's the fourth dimension, maybe, to me it's simply the truth.
Good morning, sweetheart. Beautiful day.
Well, let's hope for the best, darlin'.
But that's a wonderful quality, not a bad quality.  Have a little patience with her. She's such a good-hearted little thing and tries so hard.
Why shouldn't she go out and have boyfriends?
Well, time will tell, won't it?
Now darlin', what has the South got to do with this?
Now look, darlin', this is no time to go off into the fourth dimension.
How could Rose really be a bad influence on Dolly? She has a loving nature, you ought to want someone like that around your children. Why do you think those boys and men like her?
What she doesn't understand is that her behavior is disturbing to other people. She's young, she's got to learn to restrain the life force that's in her. Its creative, but in her case it's too creative.
She's like a different person. Being so sick made a big impression on her. I really think she's learned a lesson.
It sounds like a farm to me. Calling it a dairy establishment, that's just trickery and flummery.
She already told you, she doesn't know.
This conversation is making me a little sick.
Rosebird Baby, you are the light of my life, darlin'. How did we ever get by without you?
Ahh-hem! Now, Rose, get off my lap. What are you doing, girl? Are you crazy?
Goddamn you, girl! You've made me make a fool out of myself, damn your hide, but let me tell you I am standing at the pass of Thermopylae and I won't budge! The very idea, my own home with children in the house, to say nothing of my wife -- oh-h, you had better believe I am standing at Thermopylae, you little nut, you had better believe it! What are you, crazy? A man is supposed to be a fool like this, but a woman is supposed to have some control and sense! Are you a nitwit? What's the matter with you?
Rose, what are you doing up?
That's a pretty stylish skirt, Rose. The only thing I don't understand is how did you ever get it on.
You don't know where you're going?
Is this ill right?
Well, Rose, my sleep was a little disturbed last night, and so was Mrs. Hillyer's, and so was the children's. How about you? Was your sleep disturbed, too?
I didn't mean to bite him. He was hitting Horton with a blackjack in the meanest way and... and I bit him accidental.
And who, Rose, may I ask, is that?
Well, Rose, going out to look for a job today?
God forbid. You're not sick, Rose, forget it. Don't get any notions in your head, you're not sick.
It's so, Mr. Hillyer.
Excuse me... your voice is familiar and I'm sure I know you from somewhere...
You loved her, didn't you. Well, so did I.  You'll have to admit she had four husbands.
Well, got to get a plane to Savannah. Great running into you, Buddy. Give my best to your Daddy.
You might see her. She writes your Daddy, and she and that doctor came to see him, didn't they? I wish you'd tell her something... I never could write letters.
I don't like that, either, it's worse than Waski. I want to be called Fran.
Yes, dear, what is it?
A tenant farm? Are you trying to tell me that girl is a product of the hookworm and pellagra belt?
I'm sorry the truth nauseates you, Mrs. Hillyer, because before you leave there's a bit more of it I'd like to put to you. This operation provides a therapeutic opportunity that I feel is quite important in regard to this particular girl, who suffers not only from an ovarian cyst but from a certain psychoneurotic condition as well.
Are you human beings or are you some kind of male monsters? Is there no limit to which you won't go to keep your illusions about yourselves?
Yes, and it's very bad. It probably should be done at the hospital under general anesthesia.
Oh, no, ma'am.
It must be wonderful to be so smart. I don't see how you do it, reading all those books, learning all that stuff.
Well, you run on now.
I don't think we ought to discuss this in front of the children.
No more dentists, no more dentists...
Rose has learned her lesson, haven't you, Rose?
I... I can explain...
I was going to tell him.
How much?
You think it's that good?
A Lincoln?  What Lincoln?  Lincoln Continental?  Lincoln Mark Five... Six... ?
Come on, don't you screw with her, please!  You... you got to want this: armored car job.  CalTrust Bank. They took two million in cash...
We'll take the CalTrust heist, but if it's no good, we will hunt you down, and Billy-Boy will pull out your spine and he will beat you to death with it.
Kittle...
What do you want?  I'm clean.  I been clean a long time.
Know what he's doing, Benny?  He's trying to jog your memory.
Last time Billy-Boy did this, the guy's neck broke...  ... just like that.  Sad in a way. Why is it we don't truly appreciate our arms and legs till we've lost the use of them?
It's bone dry out there.  Everybody's hurting.  The stuff floating around's been cut so many times it's like powdered sugar, but Zimnermann's gonna fix it.
Tell me something... what's a school teacher doing having you meet for breakfast in one of the filthiest parts of downtown skank-ville?  I mean, this is not the place for fine dining, unless looking at prostitutes stimulates your appetite.
Nothing, I guess.  Just an observation.  She's really something special.  You're a lucky fella.
What'd I say?
Sons of bitches!
Make a hole, Billy-Boy.
What are you, Henry friggin' Kissinger all the sudden?
They... they shot me.
Where we going?
Happy Independence Day.
What's mine say?
That's him alright.
Okay.  But, what changed our mind?
I can't believe we're stealing.
No, we're stealing.
Hey now, look!  Let's all get on the same page here.  This shipment is do or die for Zimmermann's syndicate; all or nothing.  If we stop the drugs, we don't even have to catch him red-handed.  He's ruined cause his pushers go broke with nothing to sell.  On the other hand, if we fuck this up, it means more zombies crawling the gutters than ever and a morgue that doesn't have a single empty drawer.  More old ladies getting mugged and molested by junk-hungry needle-freaks, and all the while Zimmermann's sitting back and laughing his head off.
It's noon straight up.  Effective immediately, you three work desk jobs till midnight.
Don't you condescend to tell me how or why to honor Independence Day, and don't tell me I'm overreacting when I'm trying to bust the guy responsible for half the filthy junk coming into this city!
Well... seeing how you just suspended me, what's to stop me from calling you a crazy bastard, you old fart?
Arriving tonight
If they crash, maybe he'll run.  You can shoot him in the leg or something.
I can't believe I'm hearing this,
Yeah, my arms healed up real good, and that's how I wanna keep 'em. That's what I'm trying to tell you.
You get him?
Alright... how about you two hit the strip and start knocking some heads together?  Find out who "A.D." is.  I got a quick errand to run.
Been waiting long?
How'd we do?
We're screwed.
I don't think so.
You see that?
At that close range, we won't last long against those Star Destroyers.
There's still good in him.
To be a Jedi, Luke, you must confront and then go beyond the dark side - the side your father couldn't get past. Impatience is the easiest door - for you, like your father. Only, your father was seduced by what he found on the other side of the door, and you have held firm. You're no longer so reckless now, Luke. You are strong and patient. And now, you must face Darth Vader again!
The other he spoke of is your twin sister.
Hmm. To protect you both from the Emperor, you were hidden from your father when you were born. The Emperor knew, as I did, if Anakin were to have any offspring, they would be a threat to him. That is the reason why your sister remains safely anonymous.
The Death Star will be completed on schedule.
I told you to remain on the command ship.
Han!
Chewie and I will take care of this. You stay here.
Proper?!
My goodness! Artoo, why did you have to be so brave?
Lord Vader, this is an unexpected pleasure. We're honored by your presence.
All wings report in.
Luke, don't talk that way. You have a power I--I don't understand and could never have.
Obi-Wan has taught you well.
Told you, did he?
How many languages do you speak?
Ahhh - no - stop - I mean Janet.  Janet.
He was a Science Teacher at Denton High.
Yes Brad.
Oh Brad, I'm mad.
What was that bang?
I'm coming with you.
Oh Brad, I'm frightened.  What kind of place is this?
Brad, please lets get out of here.
Well I want to leave.
Then ask the butler - or someone.
Right!
Great Heavens, that's a laser.
You did right.
Well.    I don't like men with...er, with too many, muscles.
On the day I went away.
Oh, no no, no no.
Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
...Aren't you skating?
But you never had a chance to prove yourself.
I just dislocated my finger.
It's okay.
I always knew you was pretty.
How'd ya like hearin' ya name on TV?
Don't you open them anymore?
Can't fool around -- You look very great.
Don't be mad at him -- He just wants to help.
What was that you said about a pet shop?
...Can't do it.
Paulie, please --
Oh, Rocky!
Einstein flunked out of school... twice.
I do -- Maybe what this fight needs is something new -- a novelty.
I don't like you messin' with southpaws -- They do everything wrong.
I'll carry him 'till the third.
He got lucky.
Damn.
Then gimme Buddy Shaw -- He's ranked fifth.
Shape, nothin' -- They're afraid. They know everybody in the world's gonna see this fight an' none of them gotta prayer of beating me so they're makin' excuses so they don't have to be the chump that's gonna be whipped in front of the whole civilized world!!
Exactly what are you looking for, Apollo?
You're referring to the much publicized bicentennial fight?
Still to be held in Philadelphia?
Hey, the rink is empty 'cause we're closed -- ya ain't allowed in here so do me a favor an' not stay here.
Cost ya a buck.
It's been confirmed that it is definitely an impersonation of George Washington -- a great way to start 1976 off.
You can forget about sparring, kid.
Yo' yellow, old man.
Honest to God I'm broke -- Gimme a break.
What's ya name again?
A hundred an' thirty.
Y'know I won't be able to work for ya no more.
Here's five hundred -- Put it in your glove.
Hello, Mr. Balboa -- I'm Miles Jergens -- Please, have a seat.
Excuse me.
I'm sure you are.
Makes your breath like garbage.
Nobody likes garbage -- Anyway, this girl with the dirty mouth wasn't bad lookin', but the guys wouldn't take her out for any serious datin'.
...What?
The legs must be goin'.
Rice is a bum.
I seen the light. I figure somebody was home.
Best seat in the house -- Hey, Mick, this is too much.
Look at all them other fighters. Real good boys. Good records. Colorful. Fight their hearts out for peanuts -- But who cared? Nobody. They got it shoved in their back door. Nobody ever give them a shot at the title...
How 'bout a glass of water?
Respect, I always dished ya respect.
I'm sorry, I -- I made a mistake. Kid, I'm askin' man to man. I wanna be ya manager.
Look, you can't buy what I know. Ya can't. I've seen it all! I got pain an' I got experience.
Tie it to both ankles -- Leave two feet slack.
Whatta you get outta this?
Don't let 'im get you tight.
God bless ya, Rock.
See how fast he is -- damn!
Ya nose is broke.
Gimme the water! Ya gettin' tagged with his right. I think you should feint left and high hook 'im -- Benny, check the eyes! Can ya see?
Whatta ya talkin' about it ain't my locker no more?
The owner was suppose to pick him up three weeks ago.
Yo, Paulie.
Hey --
An' you're dyin' alone, too.
What kinda business?
I don't need a doctor, I need a different job.
...Maybe I better forget it.
Help what?
I'll do okay.
I got whiskey here.
To see ya train.
...I can't haul meat no more.
So much has happened lately -- Has it changed your life style much?
I'll tear his head off.
Is it true the most you've ever made in a prizefight is five hundred dollars?
We don't serve formula. Snookums.
Oh, a ladies man, huh?
My problem is I come here to drink in peace.  So if you don't mind...
Gee, it's swell to see you, Eddie.  We miss you in Toontown.
This is fifty bucks.  I need seventy-five before they check the books tomorrow.
A new outfit bought the Red Car.  Some big company called Cloverleaf Industries.
So you're not even gonna bother to find out if the rabbit's gettin' framed?
The rabbit's wife?  Wanna tell me what she was doin' with her arms around you?
I was hopin' you'd be there.  Maroon's called here about four times.  He says he's gotta talk to you tonight.  He says he can help you.
Are you gonna call him, Eddie?
He's not my client.  I was workin' for R.K. Maroon.
Don't you think anyone's gonna notice that Toontown's gone?
Oh... well, I... I just had to see you.
I didn't know who I could trust.
How did you get onto Doom?
So where is it?
Tell me you didn't do a snoop job for a Toon named Roger the Rabbit.
They say the rabbit got the safe idea from a cartoon he was makin' the other day.
What's with the dip?
Valiant, did you see the rabbit?
Yeah, and there's no business as expensive.  I'm twenty-five grand over budget on the latest Bunnysitter cartoon and it's all because that rabbit can't keep his mind on his work. And you know why?
I got him on loan from Disney.
Hi, Mr. Maroon.  Remember me?
You tricked me, damn you!
Look, pal, if you're still here when I finish this drink, I'm callin' the police.
Does this help?
You mean to tell me you coulda taken your hand outta that cuff at any time?
Hey, doesn't the rabbit even get a last request?
Valiant and Valiant?  Who's the other Valiant?
You know, Eddie, I'm not as much of a chump, and a patsy, a yokel as you think.
No, kid, you're a real hero.
No better?
Ay me! Sad hours seem long. Was that my father that went hence so fast?
Out--
Every man betake him to his legs.
Forbear this outrage, good Mercutio.
My poverty, but not my will consents.
Good marrow, father!
Young son, it argues a distemper'd head so soon to bid good marrow to thy bed: or if not so so, then here I hit it right, our Romeo hath not seen his bed tonight.
There is no world without Verona walls, hence banished is banished from the world and worlds exile is death. Then banished is death mis-termed. Calling death banished, thou cu'st my head off with a golden axe and smiles upon the stroke that murders me.
As the custom is, in all her best array, bear her to church.
Where is my Lady's lord?
Thou hast a careful father, child: One who, to put thee from thy heaviness, hath sorted out a sudden day of joy that thou expects nor I looked not for.
What, daughter are you busy? Need you my help?
I bade her come. God forbid! Juliet! Juliet! Juliet!
How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath To say to me that thou art out of breath? Is the news good, or bad? answer to that;
I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well. Sweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?
Where is my mother! How oddly thou repliest! Your love says, like an honest gentleman, Where is your mother?'
And from my soul too. Else beshrew them both.
Then have my lips the sin that they have took.
She speaks: O, speak again, bright angel!
[Aside] Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?
How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore? The garden walls are high and hard to climb, And the place death, considering who thou art, If any of my kinsmen find thee here.
O, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon, That monthly changes in her circled orb, Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.
Do not swear: although I joy in thee, I have no joy of this contract to-night: It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden; Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night! This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath, May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet. Good night.
So thrive my soul--
That light is not daylight, I know it, I. It is some meteor that the sun exhales to light thee on thy way to Mantua. Therefore stay yet. Thou needest not be gone.
Then window, let day in and let life out. O, think'st thou we shall ever meet again?
Verona's summer hath not such a flower.
That dreamers often lie.
Pardon, good Mercutio, my business was great; and in such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy.
Meaning, to court'sy.
A Plague o' both your houses.
Mercutio! Thou art consortest with Romeo?
Calm, Dishonorable, Vile Submission! Thou art my souls hate! Tybalt! You ratcatcher, will you walk?
While Sam and I take out the back two cars...
Of course.
So what's the deal?
You call me with the target's route, I follow along until we've reached the attack point and then I run his squag ass off the road.
What is?
And what's that supposed to mean, Seamus Reilly?
And when I consider that, I have to wonder if you don't have some ulterior motive for being here, with me, right now.
I better be getting that.
Where do you get off saying word one? All the time pretending to be one of us, it's the same thing we were doing, Seamus and myself.  And here you are so high and mighty, like you're so different from the rest of us.
Are you alright?
Who are you?  IRA?
I intend to.  This phone is wired like no other: it's got an encryption chip and instant sat-a-link recognition, it can talk to any computer in any language and make it understand.  With my custom hardware and this phone I can trace the target's cell phone signature and follow him anywhere he goes...
Now then, let's run through it one more time, shall we?  What's your job?
That was a mistake, trying to kill you. Mikhi did it without consulting me, I'd have never allowed it.
If you're lying to me you poor excuse for a human being, I'm gonna blow your brains all over this car.
Is it done?
Gregor, is that you?
How so?
A means to an end, is that it?
He's tough, your American friend.
Perhaps the police?
I'm Vincent.  And I coordinate.
What'd you say to him?
That was a nice move you did on our young friend.  Judo?
Same thing, isn't it?
What's the difference?
Help yourself.  Since when do you smoke?
Christ, I smoke a pack-and-a-half a day, and I tell myself I could be worse.  It's just so damned pleasurable.
Exactly.  Why not bring them?
You know, what you pulled back there, that was bullshit.
I came up here to sneak a smoke.
I borrowed that, too...
You don't.  You just learn to live with it.
He's going back.
That makes twice now you've saved my life.
You know him?
You sure your friend got the right place?
It is at that.
I know I don't need to say this to you, but I need to say it to you.  This is my job, I have to do it.
Not here.  They might see it.
Would you stop with that...
Because I don't walk away.
You slept with her!
Can you get it?
Tony and I have to talk some business, first.
Whatsamatter with you?  Aren't you concerned about all of this?
Shut up!  Not another word out of you!  You're going down, the Feds know all about it!  You didn't know some of it was marked, did you! Where's the rest?
Thanks for the loan, man.  I'll have it in a few days, I promise.
Oh, you would have done great.
I'll worry about that when it happens and if it happens, and it's not gonna happen!
It's no accident we stumbled on this money.  It's an answer to a prayer!  Every night and every day I've prayed that God would just -- help me out a little, give me a little push.  Tonight my prayer came true.
That's right!
I do.  It's little shit like that sends people to jail! We have to cover all the bases if we're going to pull this!
Shhh!
I'm not letting some gangbanger send me to jail.  We can't risk it.
Well neither have I, but it's us or him.  If he talks, or writes a note, or whatever, he's gonna turn us in.  Besides, he's a low life scumbag.  His kind is hardly even human anyway.
We're dead.  We're dead, We are dead...  What are we going to do?!
We gotta turn ourselves in, before they hear the tape.
You're thinking about killing him. I can't do that.  No way.  I've never killed a man.  Never even shot at one.
...Or get rid of the money.  I don't know.
You're out of your mind.
Look, Earl.  We gotta go straight. This is all messed up...
Well what are we supposed to do?
Not bad enough to kill him.
How long is it going to take?!
Jesus Christ Earl...what are we doing?...
I don't know.  They got all kinds of high-tech shit nowadays.
We're not?  How do you figure that?
Booth, listen to me...Booth!
Just one more.  This one knocks off all the rest.
And you're solid on that?
You gentlemen look like you're about to toss your collective cookies.
Ok...I'll wait.  For now. But I'm going to need a little advance, to oil the wheels, so to speak.
I understand your logic, Booth, but I don't think...two thousand's going to raise any eyebrows, do you?
Well I don't know what's going to happen next -- she's pressing this, another interrogation, another problem.
Come on, Booth.  Don't let him do this!!!
Could it have been in the Mercedes?
What's wrong?
Nothing's wrong.
Yeah I'm fine.
It doesn't matter...he's next to you.  You know, I always say to myself, you should have left him years ago. Why didn't you?
So do I.
I don't know, Booth.
Can you rely on how much they said you'd get?
Sally there's a whole world out there.  We can have a new home. A real home, not some tin-plated dump.  What are you giving up?
Sally, do you love me?
I don't remember.  We get a lot of people in here.
Business is business.  Now where the hell is it?  I wanna get out of here.  That's the plan, we're just flunkies, you know what I'm saying?
Yeah.  I told him I'd be there before five.
Uh, no...
Don't you have to be here?
We don't know.  Whoever got this payload together has one hell of a laundering system.
OK...this is good.  Our first solid lead.
Some of it.  Denning only handled a small portion of the total, but it looks like this was one of his bills.
Not exactly.  It's some lingerie store on the strip.
Yeah, racy stuff, you know the kind, right?
Hello.
I have an anniversary coming up, thought I'd buy her something special.
Yeah, she is.  She comes up to about here on me.
I don't suppose you've seen her.
Let's see...do you know her cup size?
C?
Well...I should have done a little homework, getting all the sizes, and what not.
I'm just not very good...with all of this stuff.
Very clumsy, very clumsy.  I’d have found it in a minute.
I'm at a payphone in Vegas.  What's up?
Uh, sure.  I hear you.
I'll do my best...that doesn't give me much time.
What's this?
No, Dwayne, you go ahead and relax, have a six pack and fall asleep in front of the TV, and come upstairs and pass out.  And do it all over again tomorrow!
I'll settle for a third of that.
We're out of here.
Oh Jesus Christ...
You want to see how more unglued I can get?  Try me.
Is that the mail?
Did they ever find out who they were?
There was this raffle going on at the station, some charity or church was running it, I forget, so I figure what the hell put in my five bucks...
That fire was set.  Deliberately. And probably not by anyone found at the scene.
I don't know how else you'd explain it.  The coroner's estimated time of death for everyone there was long before this fire started, unless of course Denning started it, and that doesn't make much sense.
I've waited my whole life for this job, but I don't have a shot in hell of getting it.  Do you know why?
Did you give me five-hundred dollar chips because I'm black?
Winner!  Four, winner!
The band has been playing over an hour.
Look, I need some info and I don't have time to play around.
I'm sorry, you looked like you traveled in the best circles.  But hey, I understand.  Make yourself at home, Isabella.  Champagne, caviar, whatever you want.  My ship is your ship.
That's right.  I'm the owner, the Captain -- you can call me El Capitan.
Red Dragon?  You sure about that?
Look, I've been working this case for months now...
How're they getting into the U.S. Mint to use the presses?
I'd like to pay you for that laptop.
Would you like me to tell you how your father died?
Do you have it in you, Lee?  Or are you gonna spend the rest of your life hiding like your father?
Lemme ask you something, Steven.  And I want the truth.  Is there any way I can date your daughter?  Just dinner and a movie, maybe go listen to some jazz...
You're right, you're a smart guy.  Most counterfeiters only get ten cents on the dollar.  But this is an even swap.  Pure genius.
Did you see the way those girls drove off?  I did you a favor.
Just relax and don't worry about a thing.  I'll hook you up in there.  You got condoms?
Carter, get off that stage!
What'd I say?
Hello.
Stop!  I'm sick of your bullshit!
Carter?
Do you understand the words that are coming out of my mouth?
What are you gonna do about it, grasshopper?
You're not very good at this, are you?
Come on, we still got time to order the Kosher meal.  Always get the kosher meal, they bring it first.
It sounds impossible --
Follow the Rich White Man?
Follow the RichWhiteMan...
You sound like that all the time.
Is it hot in here?
No.  It's not right.
Snoopy?  I love Snoopy.
Wait a sec - what the hell is that between her legs?
I don't understand?
Pick it up!
Let me see it again?
You thinking about that girl that dumped you?
How was the sex?
You're kidding.  No sex?  Nothing?  No mu-shu?
Very nice.
No Chinese man discovered electricity.
We're slowing down.  This must be it.
Let's go.
What is Mac out?
You go after Ricky.  I got this.
We made it, man.
I saw that.  She kissed you, didn't she? You played it cool, though.  Walking away, never looking back.
No, Carter.  I can't take this.
I know who you are, Inspector Lee.
Put your arms around me.
The Secret Service almost busted Reign at his casino in Macao, but the place burned down before we could move in.
Do you still have the bills?
Escort Detective Carter to the airport --
... if your father were alive, I would be turning to him now.  I didn't blow up the American Embassy, but I believe some of my people did.  My enemies are trying to frame me.  There is a war going on within the Triads -- and I am going to lose.  My name has been written into the book of death.
You know what a phone booth is?!
You talk very fast.
You speak English!
It's the same thing!
Okay, fine, you're full a shit, I'm full a shit.
-- what the hell is that?
You make the plate?
When we go inside, you let me handle everything, you hear?  This is my man, you dig?  My informant. You know what an informant is?
What?
Are you tellin' me nobody knows what he looks like?  Come on, there must be witnesses somewhere.
You know War?
Are you OK?
Like that.
Oh no.
No, it is China, my country, my history.  If any of it gets damaged...
Hey, baby, it's cool.  Captain just reassigned me to the Feds.
Oh, you're not gonna believe what they put me in charge of.  They sent for the Ambassador's personal Chinese Investigator type.  He is like the baddest Asian shield they got.  And I, let me repeat that, I am the man who is on the case with him.  Just the two of us, alone, workin' the whole deal as a team.
Oh baby, don't worry, I'll call you. You can count on it.
You got a lot of guts calling me.
Yeah, if you're Superfly.
How much they want?
... the director considers this top priority, considering he is a Chinese National and here under difficult circumstances.  His name is Lee.  And he is to be shown every courtesy. Within reason.
Yo, Johnson...
Hey, man, you can use her. She's an expert!
Hmmmm?
You a cop or something?
Yes.
Actually, he only asked me one ridiculous question.  The rest weren't so bad.
Yes, yes, I'm sure I only did you good, Maggie.
He wanted to know how you used to like your eggs.
Of course.
We do it to our dog.
"Nothing but net."
I didn't cook up a story.  I had a source.
Or a vegetarian?
Ellie asked me to come down to offer moral support.
Vindication.  How would you like to get some?  A chance to prove that, though your facts weren't entirely straight, your theory was correct.
The anatomy of the black widow spider of Maryland.
If she runs, then it's a cover story. All true.  All accurate.
No... They're interesting guys.  Each one of these guys has something going for him.  I mean, one's been up Everest. Another's become a priest.  One's a pretty good guitar player.  And this guy today tried to end world hunger, if you can believe that...
Of course we are.  Of course.
Get this man a Kamikaze.
Thanks.
Well, I'm writing another article on the cacophony.
Hello.  I'm looking for Maggie Carpenter.  There was a sign at the hardware store across the street...
This game is pretty important to him. He made all-stars in high school, you know.
Yes, I am.  And who are you?
They made me put my hat back on.
Did something happen to make you care about reality?
That's fair.
How romantic.
You've been here for three minutes. What did you do to her?
You misinterpret everything.  We've all been friends our whole lives.  But that's the types of relationship you wouldn't understand.
I take it the desk clerk is one of your many admirers.
You've seen the post-its.  I've already got more juicy material than I need. Why should I pay you dollar one?
Too much.
It's a birthday present for my cousin. Put your finger in.
I'm a work in progress.
I already explained about that.
I'm sorry, Bob.  She kissed me back.
To who?  Are you asking me?
You actually could make breaking and entering into a new career.  So, what are you doing here?
Hold on -- Nobody interviews Maggie in here unless they're getting haircut.
That's what he says, but if he thinks that I don't realize he's writing another article, then he's an idiot.
Over there.  Ten o'clock.  He's talking to our little Dennis.  Dennis will turn into one of those "sources say" things.
Let's go.
You okay?  I'm closing.
No, no.  You're her best friend.
There's no why, Annie.  I'm just not up for it.  I never said I was.
How about ... you're too narcissistic to commit to another human being in a long- term way.
Boats.  You go out in them. You come back in them.  I hate them.
Harold, who ran away with his secretary but came back --
Your Uncle Milton lost all his money in a Puerto Rican condominium that went belly up, don't mention the IRS or the Federal prison system.  Your mother is Barbara, your father is Cliff --
Is that all right with you?
Happy New Year, darling.
You go.
I am.  I was just... I just got... I think I got nervous.  It's normal, right? Don't you ever feel nervous about, you know?
I do.
Walter.
Beautiful view, isn't it?
I told you.  Nothing --
Oh, Walter.  I don't deserve you.
You okay?
You're a basket case.
... movie.  That's your problem.  You don't want to be in love.  You want to be in love in a movie.  Read it to me.
Your destiny can be your doom. Look at me and Rick.
Men never get this movie.
Do you think at the end of the movie when she's in the wheelchair they can still do it?
What?
Did you talk to him?
I love you, too.
But he saw you, right?
It's a sign --
This is a photo of hair.
What are your plans in New York?
I love the symphony.
She has a pattern of getting involved with losers... Once she almost ran away with a human cannonball from the circus.
No.  Not remotely.  I just want to find out about him.
Maybe you should see a shrink.
I don't even know him.  But I'm having all these fantasies about a man I've never met, who lives in Seattle.
Thank you, Tom.  I feel so much better just having blown this off.
Are his folks nice?
You touch her for the first time, and suddenly... you're home.  It's almost like...
Hi.
Grace the dispatcher.  Great.
Sam, if you're not doing anything New Year's -- obviously you're not doing anything New Year's -- we're having some people over, all of them married, not one even remotely interested in playing around.  Does that sound great or what?  I can't think of the last time I was at a party when anything actually happened.
We've been talking to -- well, let's just call him Sleepless in Seattle, and we'll be right back after this break with listener response, <u>your</u> response, to the things we've been discussing.  The number to call is...
What are you going to do, Sam?
Why not?
No last names, Jonah.  Hello there, you sound younger than our usual callers.  How come you're up so late?
And you're worried about him.
No.
I have no doubt that you're a good dad.  You can tell a lot from a person's voice.  But something must be missing if Jonah feels that you're still under a cloud.
They met at the Empire State Building, only they didn't. Never mind.
Write her.
It's Y. O. H.
Dad?  About last night?
How many people do you think heard that thing last night?
No, I'm not, but --
Just out of curiosity, do you have any friends whose names don't begin with a J?  I feel like it was a failure of the imagination on our part naming you Jonah.  What is marjoram? Does anyone know?
This is not how you do it.  You want this on an English muffin or a bun?
But not dinner necessarily on the first date because by the time you're halfway through dinner you might be sorry you asked them to dinner whereas if it's just a drink, if you like them you can always ask them for dinner but if you don't you can go home if you see what I mean.  I wonder if it still works this way.
Dad, this is amazing.  If you play this backwards, it says "Paul is dead."
It was sinking.
I miss her.  What do you think happens to someone after they die?
It's a sign.
Here is Seattle.  And here is Baltimore.  Case closed. 
I figure we could go to New York, catch the Knicks, and since we'd be there anyway, obviously we'd go to the Empire State Building --
Okay, tiger.  Time for bed.
What are you doing up?
Jonah, this isn't fair.  You don't know Victoria.  I hardly know her myself.  She is, in fact, a mystery to me.  She tosses her hair a lot.  Why does she do this? I have no idea.  Is it a twitch? Does she need a haircut? Should she use barrette so it doesn't keep falling in her face? These are things that I'm willing to get to the bottom of, and that is why I am dating her.  That is all I am doing. I am not marrying her.  Can you appreciate the difference? That's what single people do, they try people on and they see if they fit.  But nobody fits perfectly, everyone is an adjustment.
The reason I know this and you don't is that I'm younger and purer so I'm more in touch with cosmic forces.
I have to have a life.  I have to do things that I want with people my own age.  It's none of your business who I am going out with.  I don't give a good goddam if you're angry --
Did too.
What do you mean, okay? Wouldn't you like a dog?
Sure.  I'd really like that. Thank you so much.
How's Jonah taking it?
Oh.
I told you it would happen. It's bound to happen when a man works alone!
You're welcome to one.
Well?
Three hours! Just to heat enough water to wash this stuff!  I tell you something. If this strike is ever settled -- which I doubt -- I don't go back to work unless the company installs hot running water for us.  It should've been a union demand from the beginning.
Foreman wants to get the ore out. Miner wants to get his brothers out. In one piece.
Mama, can I put the candles ...
So they had a little taste of what its like to be a woman ... and they run away.
But you had to have it, didn't you? It was so nice to listen
Now don't start talking against the union again.
I did not mean to weep again. Why should I weep for joy?
Forgive me ... for saying you never thought of me.
What were they saying? About you? In there?
Let them take it!
Yes, I do. There's Ruth Barnes.
NO, she wants to be there.  And there's Mrs. Kalinsky.
I guess you got enough today to last a lifetime, huh?
But if you go back they'll lock you up again.
Tell me.
Whose funeral? We're doing all right. There hasn't been a scab near the picket line for three days.
I don't know. But I can feel it coming. It's like ... like a lull before the storm. Charley Vidal says ...
Aw, cut it out, Ruth.
No ...
Where's your mama?
Boy! Did you see the way Mama whopped that deputy with her shoe? Knocked the gun right out ...
The Junior Shop Stewards. There's lots of ways we can help.
But you've got me doing everything. Mama never used to make me dry the ...
My kids don't have enough to eat!
I know, it's wrong. Just let me go. I'll leave town ... just let me go.
And another thing. Your attitude toward Anglos. If you're gonna be a leader ...
You got a bathroom I can use before we hit the road?
Bobby?
What?
Yeah.
How?
What?
Why don't you call the cops?
Oh. Hi.
Just a fucked-up guy who played beautiful music.
There you go again. You're nothing but false notes.
You think you're the only one down here with a sad story?
Why not?
No, you're wrong, I tried to tell myself the same thing but I could have gotten up. I could have done something.
What is it?
Will you do that?  Then I want you to get out of the room.
You're good, princess. I'll give you that.
How you holding up?
Who is it?
I don't buy that. There's a place for hatred.  Did you know that Liz and I got into an argument the night she was killed? I acted like an ass and I never had a chance to apologize to her.  Do you know what that feels like?
Nice day
I'm hurting.
So, why'd you want to see me?
Don't get carried away.
You wanna score some go-fast?
You know, Jimmy, you might as well put a sign on the back of this thing asking the cops to pull you over.
Was he the president?
Danny?
Why?
Jimmy, look, there's something I have to tell you.
What?
I'm sorry.  Would you like a taste?
Not bad.
Okay ... How about um .. 6,000 a ounce.
But I just met you.
Maybe you're the one who isn't taking me seriously.
Come on, guys ...
Captain Steubing thinks you might work for the police.
Don't address me.  I didn't make the accusation.
Did it ever occur to you that someone might cop to something they didn't do rather than have their balls chewed off by a rabid weasel?
I've got a hot one.
You think I'm a Judas?
Well, if you'd rather do a stretch in la casa grande ...
Whatever you say, man.  Look ... can we talk about this?
That's him.  He's a lot prettier in person though.
I'll tell you why you didn't help - because you're a chickenshit tweaking snitch.  You're a bottom feader, Flynne.
He knows somebody ratted him.
We know what's going on.
Jimmy?
Why doesn't Palmdale P.D. just raid the guy?
You know, I'm starting to think I'd rather take my chances with Domingo than go through any more of this shit.
You, madam, are a heartless wench.
You mean like the Donner Party?
We all know how much you like hearing that. Okay, Liz, I was wrong. There.  You happy?
My sentiments exactly.
You thinking what I'm thinking?
She's 57 and she's been teaching third grade for the last 33 years.
I just want to be straight on the details.  Can I taste it?
Yes, sir.
A private, sir?
Alright, I'll give you that. Continue.
Good luck, John.
We got us a tent, forty-two feet across, eighteen feet at center, hundred-and-ten foldin' chairs. Circuit's eleven towns, covers all 'a Hasset County and most 'a Weller County.  I expect that upon completion of my military service I will be joinin' said ministry.
So, that's Ryan.
Yes, sir.
No kiddin'?
You can tell all that, just by the sound, sire?
Glad of it.
Sir, I'm sorry about what happened, I...
If that's the way you feel, why don't we wait until it's up to a thousand.
I wonder where they're going.
Would they notice and eighty-eight?
You?  Leading a squad?
Fresh out.
Uh, Captain...
He's right, Captain, it might be kind of dangerous for those flyboys.
You ever going to open those letters? Miller keeps his eyes on the maps.
I hope this boy Ryan is worth it.
Makes you feel small, doesn't it?
You alright?
What was the name of that kid at Anzio, the one who got his face burned off?
What are we going to do?
I don't think so, Captain.
Trust me, you're the best.
General Gavin is going to be very irritated at you, Captain.
Jesus Christ, he's a natural!
B:  Ryan is dead.  He's been blown up by the German equivalent of Wade, whose name I know you don't want me to mention.  There's nothing to find. The biggest piece is the size of a pea.  We wander around, looking for him until the Germans pick us off, one after another.
Maybe.  But what if he dies on the way back?  you see what I'm saying, sir?  The best possible situation is, he's dead, we find his body, more or less intact, we grab one of his dog-tags and high-tail it back to the beach, or better yet, we head over to Caen and catch up with division.
Scans the Germans with his binoculars.
I HAVE NO FUCKING IDEA.  HERE WE COME.  Cover me.
FIRES a burst.  Germans drops.
Continues FIRING.  CUTTING DOWN the advancing Germans.
Thank you, sir.
Yes, sir.
Damn fool.  Sir.
On guard, glancing back.  Pissed off.
Demolition, right?
How fast?
I'm supposed to be leaving on a fellowship that I worked for my entire life.  I don't even care.  I met this boy over the summer, and I, I can't see him because of this, I can't talk to him, I can't talk to my father about... I wore these clothes, I thought, I thought that if I looked right and if I acted right then someone would talk to me.  But I look awful and I feel awful, could you, could you please talk to me?  Be a little decent.
Speak with my lawyer.
Just come down to my place of business, for god's sake.  I have people here.
This evening is over.
The, uh, Cynthia Branson estate was worth how much?  Because her family...
Hi.
Hello Constance.  It's me, Lloyd... nothing, I'm just driving around... she broke up with me... what do I do?  Can't she come back?  How can I get her back?... I can't think, talk to me... I fucked up... I feel like crying... she gave me a pen.  I gave her my heart and she gave me a pen.
That's unlikely.
But you never had a first date.
Do me a favor; take a picture of me with her.
Yes.
I don't feel anything.
Trapped in the body of a gameshow hostess.
I told him to be himself.
Lloyd, it's us.
"Dear Diane, I'll always be there for you, all the love in my heart, Lloyd."  I've never gotten a letter like this, have you?
And I want to turn the home over to the state.
I can put that together.
Lloyd, she's being difficult.
Visit her at the home.
Having taken a few courses at the university this year, I have glimpsed our future, and all I can say is... go back.
You like it?
Alright, no more, I'm going to save it.
What are you doing?
No, wait a minute.  Everybody thinks you're what?
I'm sorry.
God, I'll have to go on a plane.
Wait a minute.  How was Lloyd?
Goodnight.
So anyway, they closed the doors, and she starts to scream.  I've never in my life heard anyone scream quite like that.
Morning.
Dad, maybe I shouldn't go with all that's happening to you.
If I pick it up, we'll only get back together.
Honey!
I swear to god.
No, you don't know what it is.  It's not for me.  This money's for you, for when you come back from England with honors to set you up, so you don't have to depend on anybody again.  Diane, I take better care of these people than their families do.  I care for them, I give them flowers, I feed them, I wipe their mouths...
Alright, alright.  Go ahead.  When I'm old, give me someone like me, but go ahead.
I just wonder what could be more important than what's going on with dad.
You will?
Thank-you.  The real world.
Whoah, what a day, huh?
Well...
I'll go.
Eight. Eight O' clock.
What are these?
Have a good sleep.
Yeah, but I feel like I fit in for the first time, you know? Like I just held them far away from me, and they did the same to me.
Sure I do.
No, I'm serious.
I think you should wear that.
Me?  Sure I do.
No.
Yeah.  With potential.
Yeah.  Now, when you feel like you're confident,...
Yeah, a little bit.  Listen, this is important.  When you feel it start to give, put the clutch in.
Now, go into second.  Little more gas... Yeah!  You can get  this whole problem.  Now, maybe you downshift to first?
I don't think I am.
I was just going to tell you that I love you.  I said it.
Well, I need to study, and...
Yeah.
It sounded like you did.
What is that?  What are you doing with your hands?  Talk to me, you're talking like that girl Sheila.
It's your castle, man.
Jim Court?
The guy with the Datsun?
The truck?
Why don't I just get your phone number, that's usually how it works.
Yeah, she is.  Good luck.
I know
I'm the distraction that's going to England with her sir.  Are you alright sir?  Are you okay?
"You can't know the horrible disappointment I feel..."
Just her name.
Joe.  Joe.  She's written sixty-five songs.  They're all about you.  They're all about pain.
Lloyd.  Lloyd Dobler, I've got you.
Yeah, hey, oh god.  Listen, I wanted to... I don't know you very well, you know, but I wanted to ask you, how did you get Diane Court to go out with you?
It's gotta stay purple.  All night.  Hey Lloyd, how ya doin'?
Oh, I was just going to...
I was gonna...
I love you man
What's your name?
The gentleman thinks a mistake's been made.
Should I stay?
There are some things that are unclear. We need to talk.
It's bad business.
Scherner told me something else about you.
That you know the meaning of the word gratitude.  That it's not some vague thing with you like with some guys.
It's true.  Never happen in Cracow, though, we all love you too much.
You held back Stern.  You held back the one man most important to my business.
If you admit to making three, then it's four, actually.  But how?
Ghetto Police.  I'm a policeman now, can you believe it?
You have any idea what a shirt like this costs?
What's wrong with it?
One of these days the Russians are going to show up unannounced at my gate.  I'd like the chance to defend myself.  I'd like my wife to have that chance.  My civilian engineers. My secretary.
I'd never ask you for money, you know that. I don't even like talking about it - money, favors - I find it very awkward, it makes me very uncomfortable -
Jews, yeah.  Investors.
This, I don't know, maybe you can trade it for something.
You think I don't know what you're doing? You're so quiet all the time?  I know.
I know what you're saying, but I don't see the difference.
I'll talk to you later.
It's got nothing to do with reality, Oskar, I know it and you know it, it's a matter of national priority to these guys.  It's got a ritual significance to them, Jews shoveling snow.
A one-armed machinist, Oskar?
That shit. He only calls you when he's drunk. Don't go over there.
No, some creep asshole trying to scare me.
Kill, kill, kill, kill, hah, hah, hah, hah...
Cici. Who's this?
"Drink with your brain." That's our motto. Who are you calling for?
Tina, it's Dawnie. I'm  on my way. Cici follows her back into the living room.
It helped me realize one thing.
I get my revenge and make some fast cash.
You know the story, Gale. Man falsely accused, sent to prison, proved innocent, released back into the real world and never trusted again. Want the exclusive?
Fair enough.
I could use some therapy.
Are they aware of your not so positive portrayal of Greek life?
Where's Sid?
How are you? You weren't in class. I called as soon as I heard...
About what?
My screwed up life shouldn't have to bleed onto my friends.
I had the four o'clock shift. You weren't there. You had us worried. Is everything okay?
Where's Sid?
She's got guards with her.
Yeah, you look quizzical yet pensive.
Ever see NATURAL BORN KILLERS? Well, Derek and I have this whole Mickey/Mallory-Woody Harrelson/Juliette Lewis thing going on.
He hates Oliver Stone.
We have our own website now. We dedicated a whole page to you.
..so we had to be different but yet the same because if you venture to far away from your orginal story you completely alienate the audience...
Hello, Dwight.
Yes, Miss Weathers, your name is embedded clearly between my ears.
Yes, I do retain reading skills. Shock.
A bloody knife. A ghost mask. Something like that?
And it's sexier in the dark.
Maybe not. But think about the sex. As frustrated as I am...
Ssshh! What was that?
Let's go.
Three hundred people watched? Nobody did anything?
Oh my God. How could it happen?
Look, Sid, why don't you take off? Disappear for a few days. I'll come with you.
The police are waiting outside. They're going to take you somewhere safe.
Who is this?
What do you want?
Sidney. Hello. How are you?
Sid, I'll come with you.
Lucas and his Romper Room stage.
He tried to kill her first.
It's okay to break, girl. You shatter if you have to.
I've been waiting for you, baby.
Randy Meeks.  He was with Sid that night in Woodsboro.
I gotta hit the library. Anatomy. Some of us have real majors. You gonna be okay, Sid?
I'll stop by the Deltas tonight.
It's all about sisterhood. Everybody thinks its about partying and blowjobs but...
Do you want to die?
I hate scary movies.
If we hurry, we can still catch the Sandra Bullock movie.
What are you talking about?
What do you want?
I'll relay it. You sure you don't wanna go home?
I think you got the wrong number, buddy.
Asshole, Can't talk.
What?!
Alright I'm here. What the fuck do you want from me?
Alright Kincaid, no where to?
Four? There are five.
You seem to like movies, Detective.
That's fine Mr. Rielly, but if anyone else should die, I'm going to have to get a warrant.
I told you, I don't know where Sidney is. And even if there was a third killer, Sidney doesn't know about it.
Before you jump to conclusions, the man in the picture, COTTON WEARY, is out of the country on business. His alibi checks out. Seems he's got a TV show in Australia, 100% COTTON. It's supposedly the biggest thing down under since Yahoo Serious, but that's besides the point.
Sidney, do you have any idea how he could've gotten your number?
Where are you Dewey?
Where's Gale?
Watch out Sid. Randy said the killer's always superhuman.
You mean OUR past as in Me and Sid. This has nothing to do with you Gale.
Brace yourself, Gale, all of this is actually not About you.
Jennifer needs me.
I've got an idea, I'll hook up with you guys later.
Sidney, what happened?
So you knew Sidney Prescott's mother.
Your life?
No really?
Oh, Come on!  You have made millions off the story of her murder.  You're obsessed with HER and you're obsessed with her DAUGHTER!
Excuse me Detective, I think we have some business to attend to.
Listen Lois Lane, I love your show and all but last month I happened to catch your little segment on me and how my wife left me because I'm a sex addict who enjoys screwing fifteen year old girls. It was a real eye opener my lawyers are still thinking about bringing to your superior's attentions.
Answer the question. You knew Sidney's mom?
Gale Weathers. What a surprise.
I think we should go inside. I have to have a talk with the cast. ALL OF YOU.
Oh my God! Sidney, you ran fast or what?  Hey.
Roman Bridger, director. And brother.  She slammed the door in my face, Sid. Said I was Rina's child and Rina was dead. And it struck me, what a good idea! So I watched her, made a little home movie, a little family film. Seems Maureen, mom, really got around. I mean, Cotton Weary was one thing, everybody knew about that, but Billy's father, that was the key! Your boyfriend didn't like seeing his daddy in my movies. Didn't like it at all. And once I supplied the motive, all the kid needed was a few pointers. Have a partner to sell out in case you get caught, find someone to frame, it was like her was making a movie.
Listen, I have no time for this. I've heard this shit before! So lets get on with it!
See Sid, now comes the part where we get away with it! The part where we win! Cause face it Sidney, in this world, the bad guys win!
All right, since I got you on the phone, let's talk about your character.
But you know my favorite name?
Roman and everybody else went home for the night. I'm here for a make-up test.
No.
Don't you want to know how you can help, Sidney?  Are you listening to me, huh?
What? She asked.
Thanks, butt wart. You did good.
You have to play, Sid. Don't want to disappoint your dad. He's been waiting around all night.
What if your father snapped? Your mom's anniversary set him off and he went on a murder spree, killing everyone...
And then he killed you and then shoots himself in the head. It's a perfect ending.
It's on the table.
I thought she was dead.
Did you ride past Casey Becker's house?
Billy? What the...
I know. He called again last night at Tatum's house.
So...
You heard me.
When you're arrested -- you're allowed one phone call? Who did you call?
Uh-huh.
It's called GUESS HOW I'M GOING TO DIE!
Hello?
I'm getting ready to watch a video.
Uh-huh.
Yeah... Freddy Krueger.
What did you say?
Is this some kind of a joke?
What do you want?
My boyfriend will be here any second and he'll be pissed when I tell him...
I wanna play a game.
What kind of game?
...please...
Don't do this. I can't...
What's his name?
...please... no...
What door am I at?
Hi! Gale Weathers. Field Correspondent, INSIDE STORY.
Productive. So they're closing down the school?
And why is that? Has something happened?
I'm twenty-five years old, ma'am.
A car was spotted in the bushes a little ways up the road.
Hey... Dewey. Can we go now?
You gonna be able to come down to the station and talk to us a bit?
Did you reach my Dad?
I don't know. I guess.
I know. We're checking every cellular account in the county. Any calls made to you or Casey Becker are being cross-referenced. It's gonna take time but we'll find him.
I see you as a young Meg Ryan myself.
Drive by patrol.
They're pulling Loomis' account. But it'll be morning before we see something. You think he did it?
There's more. Guess what tomorrow is? The anniversary of his wife's death. It all fits. He's our man.
He'd have to be crazy. Where's Sidney?
That fish smelled strong.
Casey? Where are you honey? Call the police, goddamnit.
How's the book?
You owe my mother.
He was convicted in a court of law. Your testimony put him away. It doesn't matter what I think.
She was never attacked. I think she made it all up.
You're evil.
Cut some slack. She watched her mom get butchered.
I have no idea.
Don't start. You know I don't watch that shit.
Hello?
Looks like you fingered the wrong guy... again.
I thought Blockbuster fired you.
Don't come any closer.
That was an ice pick -- not exactly the same.
And are the police aware you dated the victim?
You coming tonight?
You're such a little lap dog. He's got killer printed all over his forehead.
She's saving herself for you.
I think her father did it. How come they can't find his ass?
His movie nut mind has snapped, Sid. He's gone psycho.
Come on, Sid. Give me the gun.
You heard Billy -- shut the fuck up.
Do you believe this shit?
Or a man's mentality.
Come on, Sid.
This could be good. What do you think, Sid?
I didn't say that, Sid. But you know there were rumors. Your dad was always out of town on business. Maybe your mom was a very unhappy woman.
You're right. I'm cracking up. Ignore me.
But he's been so patient with me, Tatum. You know, with all the sex stuff. How many guys would put up with a girlfriend who's sexually anorexic?
What secret meaning? Like a Satanical thing?
TATUM!
I thought you dumped her for me.
I don't have anyone else to give this to, Somerset, you know that.  And nobody's going to swap with you.
"Dear Detectives, Long is the way, and hard, that out of hell leads up to light." It's the murderer's way of announcing himself.
You've left unfinished business before.
It's none of my business anymore.
Did you read in the paper today, about the man who was walking his dog?  he was attacked, and his wallet and his watch were taken.  And then, while he was still lying unconscious, his attacker stabbed him with a knife in both eyes.  It happened four blocks from here.
I have no understanding of this place anymore.
And... and... and he said... he asked me if I was married.  And, I could see he had a gun in his hand.
I don't believe it.
What do you mean?
What's so exciting?
It's surprising how easily a member of the press can purchase information from the men in your precinct.
You didn't know.
You wouldn't because you know there are consequences.  It's in those eyes of yours, though... nothing wrong with a man taking pleasure in his work.  I won't deny my own personal desire to turn each sin against the sinner.  I only took their sins to logical conclusions.
A woman... so ugly on the inside that she couldn't bare to go on living if she couldn't be beautiful on the outside.  A drug dealer... a drug dealing pederast, actually.  And, don't forget the disease spreading whore.  Only in a world this shitty could you even try to say these were innocent people and keep a straight face.  That's the point.  You see a deadly sin on almost every street corner, and in every home, literally.  And we tolerate it. Because it's common, it seems trivial, and we tolerate, all day long, morning, noon and night.  Not anymore.  I'm setting the example, and it's going to be puzzled over and studied and followed, from now on.
You're going to be remembered, and it's all because of me.  And, the only reason I'm here right now is because I wanted to be.
I wish I could have been a normal man like you.  I wish I could have a simple life.
I need to start getting the feel of it all, right?  Meet the people.
Not here.
There's a bucket here.
It's a bucket of vomit.
You think it was poison?
Is that clear?
I'm declining this case.  I want us reassigned.
How's that?
I'd like you to meet Somerset.
All television does is teach children that it's really cool to be stupid and eat candy bars all day.
He's preaching.
Nothing.
I'm, sorry, but even the most promising clues usually lead only to other clues. I've seen so many corpses rolled away... unrevenged.
I think Hemingway wrote somewhere... I can't remember where, but he wrote that in order to live in a place like this, you have to have the ability to kill.  I think he meant you truly must be able to do it, not just faking it, too survive.
Listen to me.  He's all about playing games.
I'm sick of sitting around, waiting for him to kill again.
There must be something in this pile of garbage we can follow.  I mean, Christ... do we have to let this lunatic make all the moves.
Oh, blah, blah, blah.  The guy's insane.
Just, realize... this is not some common lunatic.  The type of intestinal fortitude it must take... to keep a man bound for a full year.  To connect tubes to his genitals.  To sever his hand and use it to plant fingerprints.  He's methodical and exacting, and worst of all, he's patient.
Yeah.  Some college student who's taking English 101 and just happens to be writing a paper on Twentieth Century Crime.
This is a waste of time.
The Marquis de Sade and Origins of Sadism.
You're sure you're reading that right? John Doe?
This is stupid.  It'd be just too easy.
By the time we clear a warrant someone else is going to be dead.
Well, there are at least five thousand notebooks in this room, and near as I can tell, each notebook contains two hundred and fifty pages.
No.  Face it now.  Stop thinking it's good guys against bad guys.
Don't try to focus on things as black and white, because you'll go blind.  There's no winning and losing here.
Where's the victory?
Just know that in this case there's not going to be any satisfaction.  If we caught John Doe and he were the devil himself, if it turned out he were actually Satan, then, that might live up to our expectations.  No human being could do these things, right? But, this is not the devil.  It's just a man.
What is it?
Throw your gun down now!
Throw your weapon, detective!  Now!
Anything... anything missing or different.
How long have you lived here?
Oh, Tracy... I have to tell you, I'm not the one to talk to about this.
Well, I got up one morning and went to work... just like any other day, except it was my first since hearing about the baby. And, I... I felt this fear and anxiety washing over me.  I looked around, and I thought, how can we raise a child surrounded by all this?  How can a child grow up here?  So, that night, I told her I didn't want us to have it, and over the next few weeks, I convinced her it was wrong.  I mean... I wore her down, slowly.
Neighbors heard them screaming at each other for like two hours.  It was nothing new.  But, then they heard the gun go off. Both barrels.
Yes.  Look at all the passion splattered up on the wall here.
How's California?
Got a warrant?
Never mind...Your pa know you're out here?
If there's anything I can do, sir...
But he knows THAT, sir...Can't I stay, sir?
Unnt-meah!
I don't care what they've done to you...what happened...
Come f'r my rockin' chai'...ole Mose.
How'd you come by this?
That's what I said.
Keep talking.
Yes, sir.
What you want me to call you?
And you think we got a chance to find her?
She's your nothin'...She's no kin to you at all!
Sorta like 'roundabout' -- like a man says he's goin' one place when he means to go just the reverse...
Futterman?
Says her name's Wild Goose Flying in the Night Sky...but she'll answer to Look since it pleases ya...
Ethan, quit it!
Well, you're a widower now...
Stay out here.
Hard to realize they're white, isn't it...
I'd be obliged if you'd get to the point, ma'am.
Yes!..Yes, I remember!..Have they found her, Ethan?
Oh, all right! Well...Martin says...
The <U>late</U> Mister Futterman?
Take it and welcome...but don't count on finding me here when you get back...I've been dallying around this god-forsaken wind-scour almost two long years waitin' for you...I ain't cut out to be an old maid!
Where?
Say it anyway.  Come on, how much do you love me?
Ellen, move aside...
So, how does it feel to be kissed by two women?
Hey... the fuse.
My father was an electrician. Already forgot that?
I miss Tommi so much.
Now, what did I do to deserve this?
So, did you sleep good?
Don't tell me you've made friends with that wandering flea circus?
But that's not the point! What if all these things are somehow connected?
Maybe an animal.
Oh, Ellen!  I've been wondering when you'd come.  Why don't you step in.
Ellen Straub.
You know, after doing that job for so many years, you learn to appreciate the simple things in life.  Flowers incorporate a beauty that I always missed in life.  But certainly, you're not here to chat about my hobbies.
Damn, this thing is heavy. Where do you want to have it?
Ah
Follow that boat!
Do you know that house?
Thank you, my lady!
You have the last act?
Tomorrow.
What is the chief part?
Black Sue, Fat Phoebe, Rosaline, Burbage's seamstress; Aphrodite, who does it behind the Dog and
I am here to help you. Tell me in your own words.
Will it restore my gift?
A new comedy. By Will Shakespeare!
What's the title?
Romeo and Ethel The Pirate's Daughter…Almost finished?
But nothing is happening.
I want no more trouble, Mr. Fennyman. As I explained to you, the theatre business
Ned, I swear I knew nothing of this!
God be praised!  Locked?
Who is she this time?!
Nobody! You are writing it for me! I gave you three pounds a month since.
Mr. Henslowe, will you lend me fifty pounds?
Burbage offers me a partnership in the Chamberlain's Men. For fifty pounds my hired player days are over.
Now where? Will?
Will! Have you finished?
My tailor. Wants to be an actor. I have a few debts here and there. Well, that seems to be everybody. Did you see a Romeo?
Cut round him for now.
We are lost.
How will it?
Playhouses are not for well-born ladies.
Your mother, and your father
But playwrights teach nothing about love, they make it pretty, they make it comical, or they make it lust. They cannot make it true.
Your Majesty
"…All my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay, And follow thee my lord throughout the world."
It is not my fault, Master Shakespeare. I could do it yesterday.
She is a beauty, my lord, as would take a king to church for a dowry of a nutmeg.
She will breed. If she do not, send her back.
As any mule in Christendom. But if you are the man to rider her, their are rubies in the saddlebag.
What does Burbage care of that? He is readying the Curtain for Kit Marlowe.
Wait, you'll see the cat bites his head off.
Oh my lady, my love!
You can bring them with a word.
Wait! You are still a maid and perhaps as mistook in me as I was mistook in Thomas Kent.
And that was only my first try.
I found something in my sleep. The Friar who married them will take up their destinies.
I know how to fight!
You lie in your meadow as you lied in my bed.
I am aware of it, but it is beauty's privilege.
No. I have spoken to the Queen.  Her majesty's consent is requisite when a Wessex takes a wife, and once gained, her consent is her command.
Good morning, my lord!
I mean…Your Majesty, they do not, they have not, but I believe there is one who can
I understand of course. It is to be expected.
He is dead?
Where did you learn how to do that?
And break her heart and mine?
She loves me, Thomas!
She sings too?
How do I offend, my lord?
Her chaperone. My lady's country cousin.  My, but you be a handsome gallant, just as she said! You may call me Miss Wilhelmina!
Is there a man?
There was a man, poet--a theatre poet, I heard--does he come to the house?
An insolent penny-a-page rogue, Marlowe, he said, Christopher Marlowe--has he been to the house?
What's his name?
Squash is often used as a metaphor to represent a struggle for personal domination.
About this guy, this Hugo person.
No, she's not in. Without waiting for any more, he replaces the reciever and walks to the door, where he picks up the mail. On his way back from the door, David emerges, ready to go to work.
You mean immoral.
When are you going to let the police know?
You know what I'm talking about.
You know what. Who's going to do it.
That was good.
What's the problem?
Yeah, but you were good, you were really good. Fucking bin-bag', I liked that. You were good. You explored your maleness to the full there.
From what? Jehovah's Witnesses?
No, I'm sure, that'll be enough.
They know.
It looks like he's writing everything down.
No. Why should it?
I've never seen any of these men before.
Well, is it?
Sorry to waste your time.
Right.
Spacious, quiet, bright, well appointed, all that sort of stuff, all that crap.
When you get up in the morning, how do you decide what shade of black to wear?
For my life? At a discussion group? I think not.
So we'll meet him, then?
Aroused and inflamed.
I'm not usually drunk.
I think you're lying.
What sort of car?
Look over there. It's Cameron.
I hope it tastes better than the other stuff.
You know, you should spend some of that money instead of worrying about it. That's my advice.
He'll come down. Leave him alone.
He isn't safe up there. If you really cared about him, you'd use your influence to get him down, then he'd be safe.
Now you thought of that, not me.
Aren't you going to answer it?
No, definitely not. And that's that. I refuse to discuss it further.
You'll wait in the hall?
And if it sounds like I'm being killed, you'll phone the police, you'll tell them everything?
So, uh...
It's OK. There's no problem.
Good evening. I'm Detective Inspector McCall and this is DC Mitchell. I wonder if we could ask you some questions.
Two?
No, they were asleep. They didn't even wake up.
Just get on with it, Alex.
Two hundred pounds.
Yes.
Eh, I don't know.
But I bet you didn't say you were going to split on him.
-- is often sneered at. Are you aware of that?
Do you think you could answer that?
For what?
The human condition.
Air France. Glasgow. Direct, but then you're looking at the wrong end of nine hundred and twelve pounds. That's nine one two. It's up to you.
No. I haven't seen them.
Sorry?
Both, sir.
Your watch.
Anyway, you remember Harold?
What're you talking about, George?
What?
Whoever she is, she doesn't give up, does she?
Wow.
I don't want to talk about it...
-- I like myself far too much, far too much.
I've never been treated that way, and I'm not going to start now.
Your husband?
Comb my hair out later, honey.
Why didn't you come alone? Lester invited you. Did you have to bring her?
She what?
Are you in love with her?
This is the one thing I like about this house... want some lox?
Chopped liver?
Did you hear me?
Nothing, I guess... have you ever made it with a guy?
Well, are you?
... just, you could look very heavy...
What?
Yeah, it is.
No shit.
No.
You are.
And you need money?
You do know what money's like these days.
Jesus, look at this. Nine, nine and three quarters -- that's our prime rate. And I'll tell you something else: the big boys are going for it.
Yes, Buffums.
You do it.
Well, what do you think?
... I don't get it done often.
Not too much, don't cut too much.
And?
George...
Baby...
Jesus Christ, there's Norma Stern. Look at her hair.
Don't do it.
-- you are.
You don't think so? I do.
-- yeah.
-- sure.
God, there's Lester...
Oh yeah?
Yeah?...
-- you shouldn't talk to me like that no matter what, George... you know better...
-- left my bag, didn't have no money...
There were some shots.
They're dumb, somebody... I don't know...
Will we live together?
But in the same house, you know, one house.
You've never even been around one.
Not right now, I don't mean right now... but eventually...
When can I talk to you?
No, but I think they might.
When is that, George?
What?
I have to have Jackie ask me? Don't you think you could call me and let me know? Look at my hair.
I know, honey.
I don't want to fight, George.
Bullshit.
How come you took your own car?
You did fuck him, didn't you?
Didn't you, baby?
Yes.
-- and take this with you.
What do you wanna know for?
Baby, please don't... I love you.
-- please, baby --
George, now cut this out.
Stop it.
George, if you keep this up I'm going to scream.
You need a cut.
Felicia says you're a very good hairdresser.
But the important thing is you're successful at it.
But personal services are not the kind of thing I usually get into.
No, they're a pain in the ass, there's no way of keeping track of anything. It's a cash business and you've got to watch your operators or they'll steal you blind, am I right or am I right?
I wish my son knew what he wanted to do.
Sorry, honey, I...
... she's very upset...
I know it, I know it.
George, I know you have to deal with Felicia and you're caught in the middle, and if you can just bear with me tonight, well, I appreciate the way you've handled the situation.
Sit down.
Want a drink?
Yeah,, it goes up a little and then it goes down, maybe Nixon will do something. What's the difference, they're all a bunch of jerks. I wouldn't let 'em run my business, I can tell you that much. Not if I had any choice in the matter.  I don't know what to do with you. I don't know, I don't know what's right or wrong anymore.
You really think so?

You're home.
No you won't.

Well, commercials. I read for a soap the other day.
A daytime soap opera.
I was too old.
Well maybe I can get you something.
Yes.
The man from Sloan's is coming. I called you about it.
My secretary saw you with that boy.
I'd like a drink.
-- you phony asshole --
Going for a pony ride at Kiddielands, want to come along?
I am? I mean why?
I'm not. Maybe I am.
I spent three years with him. I just couldn't take it not knowing who was gonna pay the rent... his unemployment or mine. George was adorable but it drove me crackers. Now at least I'm comfortable. Lester does what he says he'll do. Maybe you're happy living like a gypsy. Are you?
-- Yeah, honey...
C'mon.
-- uhh-huhh...
-- He reached up and tore them.
Egypt?
Go ahead, Jill, you can say it.
Of course not... he's sort of a boyfriend.
George? Was he alone?
-- so when are you going to Egypt?
Now I didn't mean that, you rat.
You're kidding.
What did you say your name was, sweetheart?
Thank you.
Look, is there somewhere else you'd rather go? Maybe we can change our location.
Do you have children?
Are you married?
No!
I think they're waiting for somebody to start dinner.
I'm hungry.
Can I go to my room and get my fire-engine?
Yes.
You wouldn't ever hurt Mummy and me, would you?
Why don't you want to talk about it?
I don't know.
Well, you know Doc, when something happens it can leave a trace of itself behind... say like is someone burns toast.
Yeah.
Okay Danny, you win.  Let's take the rest of this walking, huh?
Danny?
Red Rum.
Danny.  Danny, stop it.  Danny!
Do you remember when you were brushing your teeth?
Is Tony one of your animals?
Because he hides.
What sort of injury did he have?
Sure.
Delbert Grady.
Ah ha, it's coming off now, sir.
I'd be glad to do that, sir.  Oh why don't you call me back in about eh twenty minutes?
Oh Dick, come on over and say hello to Mr. and Mrs. Torrance.
Dick, if you're ready to do it now, I think it would be a good idea if you could show Mrs. Torrance the kitchen, while I continue on with Jack.
Dick, can we borrow Mrs. Torrance for a few minutes?  We're on our way through to the basement - I promise we won't keep her very long.
Glad to meet you, Winifred.
Don't let it get you down Mrs. Torrance - it's big but it still ain't nothing but a kitchen... a lot of the stuff you'll never have to touch.
Beg pardon?
Bill, how do you do?
It's good to see you.
No charge?
Boy, we must be really high up. The air feels so different.
No.  It's the truth, really.  I swear it.  Danny told me.  He went up into one of the bedrooms, the door was open, and he saw this crazy woman in the bath-tub.  She tried to strangle him.
Did you find anything?
And you didn't see anything at all?
Somebody did that to him.
Well I... I think maybe he should be taken to a doctor.
As soon as possible.
Stay away from me!
Stay away...!
Stay away from me.
Give me the bat.
Wendy...
I'm gonna go now.
JAck, just make yourself at home. Would you like some coffee?
Hi.
Lowe's car-?
I don't want your money. You're a booger.
Are you all right, Marty?
Well, I'm not sure that was. Christ! They better get the guy.
What's going on at Owen's, Uncle Al?
Well... I like it that you always know how to say things, Uncle Al.
Don't call me dear boy.
Your mom's not around, is she?
I know you don't. But I want this to be our secret. You get that, don't you?
What about the baseball bat Jane saw in his shed? You know who used to have a baseball bat like that? Mr. Knopfler! He was so proud of it he used to carry it in the Fourth of July parade! Jane said it looked like the Green Giant used it for a toothpick!
Mr. Haller said he'd check him out, and guess what? No one sees him again!
Really.
LET THY THOUGHTS BE GUIDED
But how?
You know, I just might!
SING!
But I'm fearful!
And I'm tearful!
What do you want?  This is a private area!  Get lost!
What? 
Babe, it's not me!  I love you!  It's God!
I was good to you! You re nothing but no-talent garbage! You're a two-bit Tramp!
This prom is a real drag.
Isn't it a glorious morning?  Good morning, Mary Clarence.  sleep well?
Mary Patrick -- do you remember the Dixie Cups?
Hurry, Sister!
MY SOUL WAS IN DANGER I'D FALLEN FROM GRACE
DAMNATION WAS ALL I COULD SEE
BUT THEN CAME AN ANGEL WHO WHISPERED THESE WORDS
SING AND THE DEVIL WILL FLEE!
Mary Clarence, are you with us?
Is there any syrup?
We could cut a demo.  Look for a label.
Come on, we're late.
You have to help me
Mary Clarence!  You're so... different from the other sisters.  Sometimes, well... sometimes you sound more like a layperson.
Mary Clarence!
Mary Robert, I am so sorry about last night...
I don't want to mess anyone up...
WE'RE THE SISTERS OF THE SACRED HEART WE DO OUR BIT, NOW DO YOUR PART
Are you leaving us?
A convent?  They put me in a convent? What's the problem?  Wasn't there any more room in Hell?
You were unhappy?
Cool.  Is there a menu?  Or buffet?
Excused.  Open the cabinet to your left. You will find appropriate attire.
As a new member of our order, I think you might also enjoy a ritual fast.
Right, sure thing.  But what about, like, appliances?  Like a little color portable?  Boom box?
It's like the Stone Age.  The room time forgot.  What about a phone?
Oh, I don't know... Satan?
This is a convent, not a clinic.  We offer moral guidance, not hardware.
It never solves anything.
Really catching on.
So... hi there.
Mary Robert's life was in danger! Your behavior was inexcusable!
Mary Clarence, perhaps you are correct.
You may stay.  But I shall restrict your activities to but a single task.
Hold on.  That's not fair.  I worked hard with them.  They gave up their free time, and they loved it.  Those women are happy.  And we can get even better.  We can wake this place up.
A vote?
Hey -- your prayers have been answered. I'm leaving.  In just a couple of days.
You and I know that life is not so simple.  There will be disappointments. Rude shocks.  And you will have vanished. How... fortunate.
From Vince?  What a guy.  Doo-lang, doo- lang.
Right between the eyes!  Down and out! The guy was gone!  I... I couldn't believe it!
Ten flights?
Okay, here's what I want.  I know about this stuff.  A five-star hotel.  With room service.
I hate you.  I totally hate you.
And one bullet.  That's all it's gonna take.
What'd she say?
I've got a show -- at St. Matthew's Cathedral.  We're singing for the Cardinals.
Eddie -- I've got to go back.  They won't sing without me.  I'm deserting them.
They need you?  A bunch of nuns?  For what?  Moral guidance?  Make-up tips?
What're you doing?
Hey, girls.
But you didn't tell me!
But, boss -- she's still, you know, a nun.
She was real quiet and peaceful all the way back in the car.
You didn't shoot!
I figured if you were gonna, then I wouldn't have to.
A sweater.
What's she doing?
Are you going to shoot us all, tough guy?
But she's been exposed to the underside of life.  She is the underside of life.
But, Bishop, surely you realize -- this is a most dangerous neighborhood.
Soon, you gorgeous thing... tell me... how lonely?
We haven't heard your name yet, friend.
They spend two days in chains.
Why did you move the body, Doctor?
No clotting or gathering of pus.  No healing at all.
I will not allow it.  I will not!
Wallowing in sin and lust...
Do you have these persons' wills?
He will be burned pursuant to statutes of health.
Without disrespect, look around you.  We overflow.  As do our courts.
Very few, if any.
Tell me something.  What becomes of Young Masbath?
The Widow Windsor.
Why would he flee this direction, with so much open ground to cross before he reached cover?
We are farmers here, not lawyers or bankers, or even constables.  Every penny we earn comes from what we send down the Hudson.
Young Masbath, I am sorry for your loss.  It is a great and sad tragedy. However... I cannot be the one to look after you now.
Where are we going?
Thank you.
What is it?
We should not go much further in this murk.
All I saw was their lantern.
Often in such cases, property which has gone intestate legally passes to whomever the deceased was indebted to. And, who in this town is owed a great many debts?
You are horribly old-fashioned, aren't you?
Well, I intended to apologize for the behavior of my friend Brom Van Brunt, but it seems I've made matters worse.  I'll leave you to your business.
My suitor?
To call a person superstitious is to imply they fear magic, but not all magic is black.
He only appears to be inside the cage.  The point being...
Oh, you are hopeless.  May I keep it at least?
I have misjudged you I think.  I did not imagine you were so cruel.
Memories have come back.  I had them forgotten, and wish I could forget them again... but they are here now.  Lord, how I hate this place.
I apologize if I worried you.
Blood.
What... what are you doing... ?
When... when you spoke father's name along with accusations, I could not believe it.  I had to hide these... at least till I could confront him myself.
Ichabod...
Use caution.
Van Ripper, turn the coach about!
What... what are you doing?
Go home.
She is guilty.
Thank ye.
I don't reckon.
Yeah, they's good all right.
All right then. I'll see you bright and early. How you comin' along on that garden tiller?
Aw, pretty good. Kids are drivin' me crazy and Phyliss is gonna put me in the poorhouse. Can't complain other than that. Wouldn't do any good if I did.  Do you know Scooter, Jerry?
He won't steal. I'm tellin' you he's a pretty good ol' boy. Keeps to himself.
How 'bout you, Jerry.
French fries. I like to eat them pretty good.
He'll be here in a little while, he's takin' me to get an ice cream.
You're not crippled. Get in there and make somethin'.
Okay ladies and gentlemen  or both. It's come to the time in our show when we like to introduce the band. Over here on lead guitar Mr. Randy Horsefeathers. Come on hit a hot lick, Randy.  Well, come on, y'all are supposed to clap now. Come on! 
I thought I told everybody to get out of my house. That includes cocksuckers and retards. Get off your asses and go.
I ain't sure.
Stop it, Doyle!
Sure, I guess.
Hey, Vaughan, you know what I heard? I heard you been puttin' it to Albert Sellers that works over at the funeral home.
I don't really understand the meaning of the words.
Doyle, don't you lay one hand on her.
What's all them books?
I want to be baptized.
Don't you live somewhere?
They let you out?
Do you like to play football?
Hey there. I thought I heard somebody on the porch. Wasn't your name Karl?
Well, anyhow, I was just fixin' to go see my mama down at Ben's Dollar Store. She's workin' two till eight.
How do you know?
I've had a lot of bad thoughts since my daddy died. Sometimes I wish I was still real little and he was still here. My mama's real good, but I wish I had both of 'em.  When we went to Memphis one time in the car, it was rainin' so hard we couldn't see the road. But I wadn't scared because I thought as long as daddy was drivin' nothin' could happen to us. I feel that way about mama now.  Mama has a boyfriend now. His name is Doyle Hargraves. He works construction so he makes a pretty good livin'. He still don't help mama out with any money though. He ain't no good. He's mean to her. He don't like me at all. Mama says it's because he's jealous I belong to my daddy instead of him. He stays with us all night sometimes, but he's got his own house. Somebody told me it's so he can still have other girlfriends. I like it on the nights when he ain't at our house. I'm not so nervous then.
It ain't the truth. He shot hisself with a shotgun on purpose.
Well, I hate him.
I like the way you talk.
You want to go with me?
Boy, folks sure had it rough back a long time ago, didn't they?
I ain't got no money to get 'em with but I bet Vaughan will let me have some of them flowers at the store.
Why?
I feel sad about Karen Cross, too. I just make like to myself she loves me. I know better, though. It just feels good to me when I imagine it.
I'll play ball with ye. I reckon if neither one of us is no count it won't make no difference.
Yeah.
Way to go, Karl. We got a touchdown. That was a good lateral, man. That was just like the Wishbone.
Can we play ever' Saturday?
Just diggin'.  I ain't ever gonna be happy now. Not with that son of a bitch movin' in for good. I wish me and you and Mama could just run away. But she said he would find us wherever we went. He's crazy. Sometimes I think it would of been better if I wadn't ever born.
Karl, I ain't tryin' to say nothin' bad about you, but why don't you stop Doyle when he gets that away? You're older than him. You're strong, too. My daddy wouldn't let him do that to me and Mama.
Reckon what kind of a feelin'?
Yeah, he has to go to work in a little while. I do too.
Yes ma'am, I reckon.
I like walkin' quite a bit from time to time.
You walk fast, don't you?
Well, you have to learn. It'll take some time. Don't you know anybody down there to help you out?
Your daddy's still livin' down there from what you told me.  I guess he wouldn't help you any, would he? I wasn't thinking. You don't know anybody?
I can't promise he'll hire you. I'll have to tell him about your history.
Karl, you up?
Didn't you go to sleep at all, Karl? You been sittin' there like that all night?
Are you sure you're okay staying with that woman and boy?
Yeah.
Hey, Vaughan. How are you, Karl?
Yes ma'am.
Mustard's good on 'em to me.
Thank ye.
You're a hell of a boy, Frank. Someday you're gonna get all the good things you deserve. And Karl here's gonna get some more biscuits tonight. What do you think about that?
All right then. Well, I'll see you later. If you see Frank, tell him to come on back home. I don't get to see him all day except Sundays. He can play tomorrow.
I don't think I've ever seen you before.
What brings you back?
That boy wants me to.
Well that's a very offensive way to put it. You shouldn't say that. You were taught that, weren't you?
Okay.
He just got out of the state hospital.
Karl, maybe you and Melinda might want to take a walk or something after dinner. It's a nice night.
I thought you'd be happy to leave.
I think there must have been a little mix up. I told your sponsor or teacher or whatever he is, there couldn't be any pictures. It's s'posed to be just a little story or article or something, isn't that right?
Karl's real sensitive about having his picture made. He wouldn't even be on the bulletin board for the Easter Collage.  Melvin, would you get me a good hot cup with two sugar substitutes? You girls want some coffee?
I don't know what to tell you. I'm sorry. I made myself pretty clear I thought. He probably got busy and wasn't thinking. I know how that is. I used to teach shop and eighth grade science.
His mother told him that he was their punishment. Hers and his father's; from God, for having sex--
But, here's the thing. He'll only talk to you. He doesn't want you to ask him anything. And you shouldn't stare at him.
Also, Melinda, please don't tell anybody at the store that Albert was here tonight, okay.
Well, a lot of people in town talk and spread cruel rumors. Unfortunately, I have to keep certain parts of my life private.
Yes.
What!
And what are you, his chaperone?
Like me, too.
Your dissertation? What subject do you study?
Not an easy book.
Jesus, what happened to you?
I finished my story. I thought you might want to take a look at it.
What'll it be, Auggie?
Two tins of Schimmelpennincks. And throw in a lighter while you're at it.
Definitely.  I suppose it all goes back to Queen Elizabeth.
I didn't know you took pictures.
Amazing.  I'm not sure I get it, though. I mean, how did you ever come up with the idea to do this ... this project?
Hey, man, good to see you.
So, what brings you to a dive like this?
He's got something to tell you, Auggie.
Hey, man, how's it going?
I have to pee.  If the waiter comes, order me a corned beef on rye and a ginger ale, okay?
Did you ever go back to see her?
You made her happy. And the camera was stolen anyway. It's not as if the person you took it from really owned it.
And you think it looks better to go around dressed up like Captain Hook?
Talk away, lady of my dreams. I'm all ears.
Stop it, already. Just stop all this crap right now.  Was that your idea to call her Felicity?
You've suckered me before, darling, remember? Why should I believe you now?
You weren't so lukewarm yourself. At least at first.
A couple of moments, I'll grant you that. A second or two snatched from the jaws of eternity.
Good old Frank. And how is fat Mr. Grease Monkey these days?
Jesus Christ. This is all I need.
Not if you got her into one of those rehab programs.
Remember that business venture I was telling you about? Well, my tugboat came in. I'm flush.
Shit. You should have been married to someone by now. You know, settled down somewhere with a kid or two, a nice steady job.
Yeah, I know. To that girl who moved to Pittsburgh.
Lovely.
I should stop smoking these damn things is what I should do. The fuckers are going to kill me one day.
A little. Not much.
What do you care where it comes from? It's yours.
How'd you do out there, Jimmy?
They don't come cheap, son. These little honeys are works of art. Rolled by hand in a tropical climate, most likely by an eighteen year old girl in a thin cotton dress with no underwear on. Little beads of sweat forming in her naked cleavage. The smooth, delicate fingers nimbly turning out one masterpiece after another...
Fifty-six.  That girl had on a corset.
Forty-four. They're on special this week from the Canary Islands. A real bargain.
A good choice. You wouldn't want to celebrate the birth of your firstborn with a box of stinkers, would you? Remember to keep them in the refrigerator until you hand them out.
Any time. And congratulations to you and your wife. Just remember, though, in the immortal words of Rudyard Kipling: "A woman is just a woman, but a cigar is a smoke.
I just want to know what your game is, mister, that's all.
I'm looking for my nephew,  Thomas.
Rashid? Rashid! Is that what he told you his name was?
He goes to John Jay High School in Brooklyn.
Jesus had nothing to do with it. If He'd been involved. He would have seen to it that things worked out the opposite from what they did.
Why don't you pick some other spot? It gives a man the creeps to be stared at all morning.
I'm afraid we'll be working on a strictly freelance basis.
The name is Cyrus Cole.
I don't mean to be nosy, but I was wondering what happened to your arm.
It's only temporary. On a freelance basis.
I don't like this. I don't like it one bit.
What are you talking about?
You still have that watch Auggie gave you?
Watch out, man. You'll get yourself killed like that.
No harm done. Everything's okay now.  I've got to be going.
That's all right. If I think of something, I'll send my butler over to tell you.
Of course. Where else?
Yeah, that's right.
My father did. Believe it or not, that little baby is me.
Is that what you do? Draw pictures?
Eight-thirty.
Jesus, do you make a lot of noise. Can't you see I'm trying to work?
Three nights.
You don't have to apologize.  The coast is probably clear now anyway.
Hey, it's you.
Where did you get that thing?
You're joking, right? I mean, that's your way of trying to be funny, right?
Once a story gets hold of you, it's hard to let go.  Besides, I'm making up for lost time.
If you don't sleep, you don't dream. If you don't dream, you don't have nightmares.
All right. Listen carefully.  About twenty-five years ago, a young man went skiing alone in the Alps. There was an avalanche, the snow swallowed him up, and his body was never recovered.
Here we are.  Rembrandt's drawings. Edward Hopper. Van Gogh's letters.
And started to run.
You have one hell of a knack for getting into trouble, don't you?  So how much does it come to?
So you robbed the robbers, and now the robbers are after you.
Yeah, well, you have to be nuts to do what you did. If you want my opinion, you should give this money back to the Creeper. Just give it back and tell him you're sorry.
If you don't tell me what happened, how do you expect me to know that? I need facts, not opinions.
Here's what you're going to do. You're going to open up your backpack, take out your bag of money, count out five thousand dollars, and hand it over to Auggie.
I'm serious, all right. You've got to square it with Auggie. Since you won't give the money back to the Creeper, you can use it to make things right with Auggie. That's probably better anyway. Better to keep your friends than to worry about your enemies.
You'll do it, all right. You fuck up, you've got to undo the damage. That's how it works, buster. If you don't do it, I'm going to throw you out of here. Do you understand me? If you don't pay Auggie what you owe him. I'm finished with you.
I'll take the iced coffee.  You only live once, right?
How do you want that cooked?
With no bone or scalp or hair present.  Would it be more probable that the blood came from crushing a man's skull...
Him and his folks and two brothers and two sisters worked our land. Lived in a picker's cabin at first.
And when he came home.  Did he write you about this?  Or phone, perhaps.
So that makes what would have been $4500 into $7000, doesn't it?  If you sent the equity back, you had a profit of $2500.
So the fishing gaff method wouldn't make sense?
Compressed air horn, most likely. Hope to God some man hears you in that fog.
You mean Miyamoto followed him out there, and sucker-punched him?
We discussed that.  And decided not to.
Question withdrawn, you may step down.
He's still got a good grip.  We need to dig more.
There can't be any wrong in this, Ha...
My father can't get our money from the bank.  We have a few dol...
I couldn't say anything.  I just stood there, hating her.
You don't believe in God anymore.
They only arrested that poor soul because he's Japanese.
And you weren't there, when the coroner examined the wound.
And replaced it later with the new one.  That's your inference?
As peculiar as a struggle between a 235 pound man, and an assailant strong enough to subdue him...that leaves only a <u>single</u> overturned <u>cup</u> in its wake?
Maybe it went.  Where Carl went. Over the side.
<u>Everything</u> had to happen <u>just</u> right.  For your little story to fly.  I mean, a blond hair could be on that gunnel for a <u>lot</u> of reasons.
Then putting them together.  So truth is revealed.
I should have told everything right away.  I know that now, and I regret it.
I did.  Boy.
He's looking down.  And he's not thinking 'bout the man you were yesterday.  He's proud of the man you are tonight.  That's what counts.
Bet there's a few things you could teach me.  Kendo, for one.
Maybe the assailant straightened the cabin.  And forgot the cup.
I think you testified <u>all</u> the lights were on.  Cabin, mast, net lights, picking lights...
Now I did some measuring down at the chandlery.  A D-6 is one inch wider than a D-8.  It would be too large for the deceased's well.
So the defendant went out fishing for the night with <u>no</u> spare battery, hmmn?
I believe so.
You don't.  <u>Think</u> so.
How <u>is</u> your mother-in-law?
What else could it be?
Well...
So if his head struck something narrow and flat, the gunnel of a boat, a net roller, a fairlead, could that have...
So your husband said he's think it over.  Encouraged Mr. Miyamoto to believe he might sell to h...
Those 'dirty looks'.  Defendant ever aim one of those at you?
...He used to say, "If it ain't broke, don't fix it."
Forget it, doll.  After all, you work here - I work here - and believe you me, it's nice to have you with the organization.
You know, Bienstock, there's something funny about those two new girls.
This a private clambake, or can anybody join?
Cut it out, girls.  Stop it. Joe - Josephine - help!
Same faces - same instruments -  - and here's your Valentine's card.
What happened?
Say, Joe - tonight's the night, isn't it?
I mean, we get paid tonight, don't we?
Because I lost a filling in my back tooth. I gotta go to the dentist tomorrow.
First thing tomorrow we're going to pay everybody a little something on account.
You're going to bet my money on a dog?
Yeah - where were you?
With me?
We didn't see anything -  - did we?
You don't see any blood?
How can they walk on these things? How do they keep their balance?
Hello, everybody.  I'm the bass fiddle. Just call me Daphne.
You'd better go fix it.
Look - no butter, no pastry, and no Sugar!
Steady, boy.  Just keep telling yourself you're a girl.
What are you doing?
What's going on here?  Daphne - Daphne -
What happened?
Blow where?
How can we?  We're broke.
So you got pinched in the elevator. So what?  Would you rather be picking lead out of your navel?
What is it, young lady?  What are you staring at?
He's not only got a yacht, he's got a bicycle.
You know - the old shell game.
What message?  What motorboat?
I'll say there is!
Like what are you going to do on your honeymoon?
Oh.
Jerry, listen to me - there are laws - conventions - it's just not being done!
Drop her a postcard.  Any minute now those gorillas may be up here -
Did you hear that?
Elope?  But there are laws - conventions -
And that's one of them.
And your head is hot.
I'm a girl, I'm a girl, I'm a girl -
How's the bottle?
See?  She doesn't have one either -  You don't?
I mean, your shoulders - and your arms -
Yeah - Josephine.
No!
What for?
Thirty-four.
Didn't you girls say you went to a conservatory?
I was it.
I am Osgood Fielding the Third.
Yes, indeed.  It's cost my family quite a bit of money.
If I promise not to be a naughty boy - how about dinner tonight?
Oh, of course.  which of these instruments do you play?
Please.  It won't happen again.
But it's such a waste - a full moon - an empty yacht -
You're leading again.
I don't care.
Oh?
What's the job?
Because I got some plans -
We understand.
Then why did you take this job?
Me?
You can't trust those guys.
That so?
Yeah.
Oh, I don't care how rich he is - as long as he has a yacht and his own private railroad car and his own toothpaste.
Men who wear glasses are so much more gentle and sweet and helpless. Haven't you ever noticed?
Okay, Sugar - all clear.  You better go back to bed.
Want to switch berths with me?
You're not hurt, are you?
Well - a group of us are appearing at the hotel. Sweet Sue and Her Society Syncopators.
- and always the same Four Hundred.
Maybe I'll tell you when I know you a little better.  What are you doing tonight?
And you will come to hear us tonight?
What's on Thursdays?
You mean we're alone on the boat?
It's not the icebergs.  But there are certain men who would try to take advantage of a situation like this.
What thing?
See?  Nothing.
Well, it was my freshman year at Princeton - there was this girl - her name was Nellie - her father was vice-president of Hupmobile - she wore glasses, too.  That summer we spent our vacation at the Grand Canyon - we were standing on the highest ledge, watching the sunset - suddenly we had an impulse to kiss - I took off my glasses - I took a step toward her - she took a step toward me -
Anything this time?
That's wonderful.  Poor Josephine.
You're not?
Oh - that kind of a merger.  Is she young? Pretty?
Oh.  The navigator just came in - we're ready to cast off.
Sugar!  What do you think you're doing?
You don't want me, Sugar - I'm a liar and a phony - a saxophone player - one of those no-goodnicks you've been running away from -
PLEASE!
Better bring the check now - in case the joint gets raided.
A little country club we run for retired bootleggers.  I'm gonna put your name up for membership.
Well, Spats Colombo - if I were saw one.
Ever hear of the DeLuxe French Cleaners on Wabash Avenue?
God, Kat! Please. Don’t be nice to me. I can take anything right now but you being nice to me.
We were eating and puking together in harmony until one day, Tony walked me home from school. He was my first boyfriend.  I was fourteen.
You know what? I’m not having this conversation right now.
Fred Astaire and what’s her face!
I blame Tony Pee-Pants!
Just because some slag’s been paid for, doesn’t mean you’ve got to...you know.
I think I love you, mate.  How do you know so much about so much?
What’s his problem?
That’s when I realized I wanted to be a doctor.
I didn’t deserve her back then.
Nothing.
Hey.
Seeing you again....
Right. Seven.  Christ, that’s a long time, isn’t it?
You’re not even listening.
I’m sorry?
Don’t patronize me. They’ve clearly been at this a while.
What did he say exactly? I mean, you don’t think he wants me back?
Six thousand, right?
How does it feel to get that much money just for being you?
That won’t be an issue, believe me. I find the idea of sex for money morally repugnant.  No offense.
Who are they?
Have you ever done anything like this before?
Sorry. I’m a little nervous. I never thought something like this would happen to me.
Subtle?
It’s hard to explain.
There was something in your voice on the phone that day.
What would you do if you stopped worrying about what other people think?
Fourteen and he’s hoodwinked by a an erector set?
Hi.
Kat Ellis! We live two hundred miles away from each other but I have to fly all the way to London to see you. You haven’t visited me once in D.C. Where the hell have you been? I have gynecologists that call more often.
You didn’t have to do that.
Oh, no. He told you.
You want me to let him in?
So why’d you let him go?
I’m worried. Amy’s not good at drinking. She gets sooo drunk sooo fast. Does free alcohol get you less drunk or more drunker?  Is it ‘drunker’ or ‘drunker-er’?
I always wondered what happened with us.
My name is Camille -- Camille Johnson and I'm the Supervisor of this school. What's your name?
And you say all them people is dead now?
Don't you teach in your school 'bout folk who ain't dead?
Now don't you think it's time you told me all about yourself?
You think about your father a lot, don't you?
:--THE STRANGE ENDINGS OF NATURE THEY HAVE SEEN, MAY GIVE THE WORLD NEW POINTS OF VIEW AND MAKE THEIR LOVING, LIVING, AND DOING PRECIOUS TO ALL HUMAN...
:...FINER SPIRITS BOON AND GUERDON FOR WHAT THEY LOSE ON EARTH BY BEING BLACK.
You learnin' anything at that school?
Readin' must be somethin' powerful, huh, son?
Yep. I guess you must wonder why though, what with the luck we havin', but like I always say--
What's wrong with your leg, Daddy?
Son, that was some trip you went on...
Where's everybody?
You just came back home, Daddy. I don't wanna leave right now -- I wanna stay home and be with you.
You know somethin', Daddy?
What's your daddy's name?
Naw, I'm carryin' it!
You got two shirts on?
'Bye, Mama...
I cut it on some glass and we got lost, Mama.
What's wrong with him, David?
It's when the heat is so bad, dogs go crazy.
What's wrong, Nathan?
Be good and be smart, little boy.
We brought your laundry, Miss Boatwright.
This is for your mama's work, and here's something for the three of you.
But, Miss Boatwright, you--
You know, one time by mistake I went into a white church down in Row County and to this day I don't know how'n the devil I got outta that church alive.
Well, let me have it.
Don't take all day at that table, David Lee.
That's one dollar an' twenty cents.
The most important thing is that you're home!  We was gonna have cold eatin' tonight, 'cause of the heat, but now, I'm goin' to cook!
No, I ain't got no word yet, Rebecca. I went to the courthouse yesterday to see 'bout it, but they just won't tell me nothin' about what labor camp Nathan was sent to. I'm sorry, Rebecca.
Howya do, Rebecca. I sorta been expectin' you this mornin'.
The clitoris?! I DID IT!! I FOUND THE CLITORIS!!
Of COURSE!! Ice cream!!
YOU JUST DON'T CARE!
Come on, you guys... We have to THINK!
Aw, screw it. It probably isn't all that good anyway.
Mph rmph rm!!
GO AWAY, KENNY!  IT'S NOT MY GOSH DARN FAULT!
Ugh... You guys, seriously... I'm having Cheesy Poof withdrawal...
Eric, you're not watching your mouth!
Oh yeah.
What?
Kyle?!
Chef, what does it mean that we're at war?
Ber dada!
Yes I am!
What are you doing?! Get on with your misery!
Him? I don't know... He can be nice... sometimes.
What do you mean?! I could leave him if I wanted to!
Mph mph.
What? What do you mean you don't belong here? Relax guy, hell is for children.
Mrph?
Boys, we have to have a difficult discussion.
YOU GOTTA BE FUCKING KIDDING ME!!
What's the password?
SHIT!
That's gonna take a long time!
It's okay, I am done for.
Nowhere.
Dude, anybody who doesn't think Terrance and Phillip is funny can fuck off anyways.
Dude, our moms arrested Terrance and Phillip!
What? What don't I get?  What don't I get?
Whoa!  What the hell was that?!
I'm so sick of these soldiers.
Wow, a lot of people showed up.
Thank you, Kenny.
Whew, I'm sure glad that's over.
Mom, I'm a man. Just a man. And I'm going to have fun with profanity just like you and dad did when you were little.
Oh dear God...
Oh Lord, what have we done...?
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?! We need to stop the not pretty things from letting our children be born in hospitals!
My fellow Americans. I have led this fight in the War against profanity. I have founded Mothers Against Canada.  Our neighbor to the north has abused us for the last time.
I'm needing lunch.
You'd fuck your uncle!
Oh, a new recruit, huh? Welcome to hell, kid! Relax! Take a load off!!
Saddam, would you let me do my job please!
I don't see why you have to belittle me in front of people like that.
It has come to be...  The Four Horsemen are drawing nigh!  The time of the prophecy is upon us!
Hey, I'm missing the party!
Yeah!
Wendy... How would you like to go get some ice cream?
Got it.
I think we're moving.
Well, so we are.  Sure is beautiful, huh?
Well, it was nice meeting you. Enjoy the rest of the trip.
No, I think hygiene is important. It helps you get into the part.
Where the hell did you come from?
Weren't you down in the dining room?
And what are they doing now, Mac?
I am here to provide service to... to all our guests.  There is a high level of passenger dissatisfaction. It is my duty...to report this.
It's telling me fail mode confirmed.  Did you see this?
Barnes, can you hear me, are you all right?
Break it down to me, what's going on?
Will do.  What about the distress signal?
Well that's your call.  Doesn't make a damn bit of difference to me.  Just as long as I get my cut.
This ship is going down in a blaze of glory!
Now I got enough air and supplies to make another complete orbit in the pod!  You're just gonna have to pick me up later.
Good.  Now you'll hear from me when I have the new coordinates. In the meantime don't bug me.
No.  But it buys a lot of other things.
Well...I don't mind.  I can put up with it.  I'm taking six months off after this, and I won't have to deal with people snapping their fingers at me.
Oh right, right you're on that research grant.
Ryan Taylor, first mate.  Welcome aboard.  First time in space?
I'm sure you'll be all right.
OK...it's open.
Are you ready?
Yeah.  We did it.
Be careful, you don't want to puncture the suit.
Do you want some advice?
I'm not going with you.
I will once I get past the bulkhead.  Good luck.
What do you mean?  What happened!
No, just enjoying the view.
Where's Taylor?
I'm going back for Taylor!
Well now what are we gonna do!
Look.  We're talking about life and death here.  I don't know why we're even having this conversation.
I tell you, something's not right here.  How do we know they're not going to use the pod for themselves?
Mac, what about the suit compartments on this level?  Can they be accessed?
Ok Mac...  I'll talk to you on this. I want to find a way to get to the bridge, then I want you to come back.
Is it safe for human transport?
Haven't seen a ball like that since '69.
Sorry about your loss.
Yeah, basement bingo.
Hey, you still here?
You got an 8-track tape player on purpose, just 'cause you knew the only thing they had on 8-track was fuckin' opera.
Bowling was the most incorruptible sport. No megalomillionaires, no 
Sure, Sid.
Hello Mr. Kastle.  Junior, long time. I thought they locked you up and threw away the warden!
Did you know you were parked in the handicap space?
It's a beautiful thing.
Sure, around here, any fat old bald guy could be king. I'm nothing. It wouldn't do any good for me to talk to the Congress.  Hey, you thirsty? You like orange whips?
Who are you? Who sent you here?
I don't know no Grace Skinner.
Millie left to stay with her sister in Ronkonkoma.
No...
You give Ed Klein of the American Bowling Congress a call.  Tell him your Maynard's boy. He's expecting you, and he owes me. He'll getcha back in like Flynn.  Don't say I never gave you nothing.
Oh sure. Let everyone in. From now on I leave the door wide open. Let the parade begin!
He's the guy Buzz.
Son?
Don't tell me, John.
Theo. Howzitgoin.
Knock-knock.
Who's there!
Come on Sheila, knock-knock.
We're having a party for you, boy. Cake and shish-k-bob, just like you love. Junior cringes away from the light.
I have someone for you to play with Junior.
Buzz has been moving the cash out in hollow bowling pins. Sid and Breeze throw sideways glances at each other.
What if he wants to get out?
A guy like you could breathe some fire into bowling. You got ambition like a...like a...blowtorch. You go for what you want and anything that gets in your way - PSSSHHT! -  shish kebabs.  Maybe lady fate washed you up on my doorstep for your own good.  I think I could help you, Theo.
You already have a partner Mr. Kastle. Sheila walks over as the sleazeballs' car pulls out of the driveway.
Where's Junior?
I bet you didn't know that you and Junior have something in common, Theo: Junior can't bowl anymore either. Isn't that right Junior? Kastle SLAMS the ketchup bottle down on Junior's right hand. The table settings jump from the shock. Junior sits impassively, his face a blank.
Fantastic! What talent.
Grasp firmly. Then what?
Is Mr. Fazeli in please?
I came here to have a word with your dad.
Whoa.
Can I ask you something personal?
Do you have a girlfriend?
So this brother of yours is hazardous to the health of your dates?
Unfortunately what he wants is you.
I wanted to be a motocross champion. My folks didn't really care what I did. Then Junior blew a fuse and I became their last hope. Most girls get ballet stuffed down their throats, I got bowling. I never understood how anyone could take it so seriously. I hope I'm not insulting you.
What's plan B?
What do you think my dad's gonna do for you?
You professional men drive a hard bargain. I'm afraid I only have five on me. Sheila pulls out a 5 dollar bill.
If Junior finds us, he'll kill us both.
Say something, Theo. Give me something. A doll's legs catch fire. Theo stares into Sheila's eyes.
You drag that coconut around for your health, or do you know how to use it?
I am not leaving without him.  Do you hear me?  We come down as a team, we leave as a team.
The surface ships will be back. After the storm clears.
I'm not sure.  I've never seen anything like it.
Don't do it!
Anything else?
We're moving fast considering the storm.
How deep is he?
Not really, no.  Something of the military crashes in the ocean -- it explains why there was nothing on the news, why you've kept everything a secret...  When did it crash?
Coral grows at a rate of two and a half centimeters a year --
Off the record, I don't mind telling you, this thing scares the shit out of me.
We think it might.  That's why we brought you here.  We've assembled your team -- they're waiting for us now.
The one you recommended.  In the ULF report you wrote for the Bush administration.
Your report's become our bible down here, Dr. Johnson.  We've been carrying out each of your recommendations -- one by one -- to the smallest detail.
What is it, Norman?
You can't just leave Harry down here, sir.
'81, I think.  She tried again five years ago.  I thought you should know.
He translated it wrong.  "My name is Jerry"?  It's like "See Spot run."
Great, okay.  Ask him about his weapons.
Edmunds?
I don't want you talking to Jerry.
Going active.
I did.
We know how this craft got here. Where it's been.
Ignorant.  The thing's ignorant.
Not now, Beth.  Please.  I want to know who we're talking to before we start talking.  Where's Edmunds?
Edmunds?  Get in here.  I want to know exactly how this is being transmitted.
She wired this system.
Look at this.
Time travel.  I always thought it was one of those myths... like Santa's reindeer.
But what does it do?  This... sphere.
Can I stay, sir?  I'm willing to risk it.  I am.  After what we just witnessed.
Did you hear me, sir, because --
Well, until we know exactly what it is, nobody goes outside, understood?
What do you expect?  For them to bring it up here?
Where'd this come from?
We have a library?
Yeah, it was awful.
What?  Why...
Beth --
Forget the sub.
It's not worth the risk.
You, me and Harry?
Wake him, then.  Let's go.  Get outta --
Four days?
You should know how it works.  Just in case.
You fixed my suit?
Yes, Norman.  I did.  You're just nervous.
Getting food.  We were out of food. what's wrong?  You sound mad.
You don't believe me.
"Our fisherman frequently see some that are more than four feet long. Some skeletons of squids...
He acquired some sort of power.  A power to manifest things.
I don't know.
It's his fear.  The squid.  He's manifesting his fears.  Making them real.
And that's the part of Harry that's being manifested.
Tranquilizer.  Causes drowsiness.
What's that?
It's like a sleeping pill?
"20 cc's of parasolutrine in combination with 6 cc's of paracin given IV produces deep sleep suitable for emergency surgical procedures... no cardiac side effects ... REM activity is surpressed... "
What's wrong, Norman?
You know what I mean.
Do you fear them?
Are you manifesting them?
Why did you go in the sphere, Beth?
Against what?  Harry's unconscious. He's not a threat.
He can't manifest.
Then why, Beth?  Why go in?  Why put out explosives?  Why manifest the snakes?
That's bullshit.
Shut up, Beth --
Where is it coming from, Beth?
You hear that?
Get away from me!
I don't get it.
Pry the thing open?  What are we -- neanderthals?
Yes you did.  Norman, I wouldn't leave you out there.  You know that.
Where's it coming from?
How are you feeling, Norman?
You holding up alright?
And we're just talking about three- dimensional creatures.  What if it's five or six or seven-dimensional?  So dimensional that we couldn't even see it to kill it.
No.  I didn't say that.
Norman?
What happens on page 87?  Have you ever read page 87?
These aren't half bad, Fletcher.  You might have a second career coming.
Getting anywhere with those?
Have you looked outside?  Jellyfish. Everywhere.  I hate jellyfish.  Harry, what happened in the cafeteria?
... you there?  Norman?
Thank you.  My suit -- Beth said she fixed it --
What do you mean?  She's not here?
Wisconsin's your answer.
We're never gonna make it.
I can't reach her.
Missed.
Hold on.
What does Norman already know?
Why would this ship carry instructions in English?
All the facts you need are right in front of you.
An American spacecraft?  Half a mile long?  And buried 400 years?  Yeah, good theory, Harry.
It didn't fly here.  It <u>arrived</u> here.
Hey, go easy on the salt, will ya? We're not a bunch of icy streets here.
Norman Johnson.
By the way sir, I've read your report.  I think it's brilliant.
What report?
You want me to try?
Take a look.  I rearranged the numbers.  Put 'em up to the light.  Go ahead.  Squint at it.
Has Harry spoken with Jerry?
There's nothing on the news about a crash.  Did he say what airline?
We have to find he rebels... What we're carrying belongs to them.
I think there are some things we should talk about.
That's straight through the central core... up toward the top of the city... Once you've got her, avoid the main transports, they'll shut down immediately.  Your only chance is through the service shafts. There are no sensors there... All right now, get going, you don't have time.  I hope you can remember everything.
Who are you anyway?
I know who you are.  Stand up so that we can talk properly.  You're embarrassing me.  I'm not that important.
I had one, but it was taken at the battle of Condawn...
But she's a member of The Twelve Families.  How can they hold her?
What's wrong?  What's happening?
Are you sure you don't need it?
But she is the only link between us and the hidden bases.
I can't see!  How can I fight?
I can't do it.  I'll get hit.
The Kiber Crystal.
Of course, where you been kid?
You're Starkiller?
Put that thing away or you're going to get us all killed.
Where are you taking us now anyway?
You got yourself a ship.  We can leave as soon as you're ready.
Well, I practice a lot...
Watch it!  Move back.
Are there medical facilities on Yavin?
There's a lot of carbon scoring here. It looks like you boys have seen a lot of action...
I can't make it.  You go on, master Luke.  It doesn't make sense for you to risk yourself on my account.  I'm done for.
I think we're going to need them. Blast it!
See Threepio... do you copy?
Wait a minute, slow down!... That's better.  They're where?  They what? They are?  Oh, no! We're going to be mashed into conduit before this is over...
Mr. Barcalow, save power, don't waste it on workers... Ace, tell Aardvark we're on our way...
Ten of clubs. You still gonna sign up for Starside R&D ?
I've been thinking about applying for Federal Service, too. Fleet, maybe.
Are you alright ?
In simulation, my supervisors could never keep up.
Thanks. You read my mind. Third watch always seems to last forever.
Profile's wrong... there.
WHERE IS IT ?
Let's disregaed rank... Everybody hear that ? Rank is not an issue here.
So ?
Carmen...?
I'm sorry, Carmen.
Where are you going ?
Good for you.
Marco's sister. Can you imagine maneuvering half a million tons through crwoded space lanes... You gotta have nerves of steel ! Reflexes are critical
Well, if that's the crop, that must be the gastric caecal...
Romance is just a vestigial biological response to procreation...
I love you, Carmen.
Johnny...! I thought you were dead !
Where's Lieutenant Barcalow ?
This is Rodger Young, we're going down... Repeat, this is Rodger Young, we're going down...!
Steady as she goes, number one. Prepare for warp. Number two, design for Jupiter orbit.
Hey, Rico, wanna dance ?
You still gonna play for Brazil ?
What ?
Cover me.
It stinks, you goin.
If they didn't want you, they woulda kicked you out, amigo.
What's that, Diz ?
Hey, Diz...
Planet P ? What kind of name is that ?
Johnny, people get hurt... people get killed in the Federal Service. If something happened to you I don't know what I would do...
Oh, my, what's that ?
Wait a minute ! Carl is doing his Federal and he isn't inferior. He's the smartest kid at school !
You'll resign, and that's all there is to it. It might look bad, but if that's the worst you suffer...
Seeing as how we're about all that's left of  1st Brigade, you'd have to call that an improvement.  You top kick ?
No talking please. I'm going to ask you some questions. Please answer all questions truthfully. We'll know if you don't. Birthplace ?
Hello... Oh, Johnny...!
On whose authority, Corporal ?
You're standing on my H.Q., Lieutenant !
What do you think you're doing ?
That would mean a comlete disregard for the mission objective. They hang you for that, Rico.
Can you walk ?
This is Rodger Young... What's going on down there ? We're taking plasma ! We have Orion P-11 as clear !
I wanna join up, Mr. Rasczak. I think I have what it take to be a citizen.
All dead except one, sir.
Yopu asked me some advice once, Rico. Want some now ?
<U>Why</U>...?!
<U>Why</U>?!
Then V'ger must withdraw its orbiting devices.
What does that mean?
To join, and become One with the Creator?
Departure angle on viewer.
Yes.
Explanation, Mr. Decker: Why was my phaser order countermanded?
If our Executive Officer has no objections...?
I advise caution, Captain; we can't withstand another attack.
Hello, Ilia.
Was he difficult?
Lieutenant Ilia reporting for duty, sir.
Mr. Spock?
Thirty seconds to Cloud boundary...
Maneuvering thrusters, Mr. Sulu; ahead one third.  Full sensor scan, Mr. Spock; they can't expect us <U>not</U> to look them over now!
Clear the bridge, Captain...?
Admiral, I've been hoping to see you. Maybe you can get through to those thick heads in Starfleet that...
I still contain fragments of my human half.
Let it drop, Bones.  You are my Science Officer -- I'll expect an <U>immediate</U> report on anything further you learn or <U>sense</U> from here on.
Do <U>not</U> return scan, Mr. Spock! It may be misinterpreted as hostility!
It appears that our message has been understood, Captain.
That vessel is generating a forcefield measurably greater than the radiation of the Earth's sun.
What should you have known?
What answers?
V'ger plans to literally <U>meld</U> to reduce both itself and the Creator to patterns...
Engineering... Status, Mr. Scott?
Negative helm control, Captain! Going reverse on impulse power...!
Evening, Annie.
You're doing a <u>Play</u>...
You haven't heard of it.
I quit the movie.
Actually, I'm not sure if I quit.  I think that I got fired.  I'm such a liar. I never could tell the truth.
Could you tell me when's the next train?
No, of course, you don't want to talk about it.
But why the dalmation?
But, but but but...
Goodbye.
So that the Old Mill, the Old <u>Mill</u> represents...the wheel of fate is that too...
...that's what the swing is <u>there</u> for...thats its <u>purpose</u>, <u>isn't</u> it...
...such a pleasant sound.
Cause, cause, it's...it's the <u>simple</u> things, that...
...who...?
In fact, in fact, in fact, I'm not sure if I'm giving <u>them</u> a second chance, or they're giving it to me.  That's the truth.  The truth's best, don't you think?
About <u>conflict</u>...
"Rise, one need not bend the knee before the throne of justice."
What are you doing down there?
Fix my glasses.
Would you put on your cl...  Just leave it outside.
And here's some hydrogen peroxide.
Yes.
...yes.
Where you going?
Going home, yeah.  I told them what you said...
How's your star?
I've been thinking: look at this: we live up here...
What am I gonna do?
Waal, <u>there</u> you are, and Have I Got Some News for <u>You</u>...
I've been thinking.
I'm sorry.
Cluster of events.  Don't see something, ten years, allasudden.  Three times inna night.
Town ain't got no courthouse.
<u>Wonderful</u> scr...
Rewrites that Bob Barrenger requested... the "dead horse scene," the...
A jacket for five dollars...I can buy this town for fifty bucks.
I will.
What is that in fingers...?  Just kidding, get me this horse.
Have you got the new pages on the Old Mill?  Hey, Bob.
That's right.
Well, I'm pretty impolite.  Would you like some?
What else?
The people came to see a motion <u>Picture</u>.  ...hold on...
Tell it with pictures.  What I'm saying...
No, you're absolutely r...
<u>Bobby</u>...
We're going to discuss the scr...you wanna come along...?
You guys had better leave us a...
I'm very sorry to...
Well, now, Mr. Barrenger, I'm very sorry, in fact, I'm as sorry as I could be, <u>but</u>...
Aren't you ever in school?
And I have Mr. Barrenger's Tuna B...
No.
Matzoh!  Are you Jewish?
You can't do what?
...I know...I know...
Wally...
Not now, I'm talking to the press. Claire!
...I know, I'm so...because I said: yes, a woman who...the...the community <u>respects</u> her.  Please don't go.  Please don't go.  What can I do but beseech you...?  Trauma, <u>toil</u>...when are we free of them...?  When...?
Hello.
I'm so comfortable with that, Walt, I can't <u>tell</u> you...
No, are you kidding me, Bob, not at all.
Somebody make a note.  I want Li..., for the broad...what does she like?  Lilacs. Okay.  A truck of lilacs when the broad comes.  And get something for Bob Barrenger, get him, what does he like...?
She doesn't want to Bare Her Breasts.
Uh.  Bob Barrenger, fella, <u>Cameraman</u>...
...I just swore my life away, back in that...
Doug, the traffic light...
Conspiracy in Statutory Rape?  Okay.  Of whom?
And I've got a witness!  Your Mr. White saw the crime.
Could you tell me where a fellow goes to get a drink in this town?
Half a buck I'd put him in jail...
I had a witness I would.
You know, the rape, to...even to the accident...
Who's White...?
He saw the accident...?
He saw the girl in the car...
Town's out of lilacs.
I...
I...?
We're out of money.
Grace: get Mr. White a typewriter.
Hey, Joe...Good.  You know B...
And maybe it will be a better movie without the old mill, I...
I can't.
Why?
Then you're finished in show business.
<u>Siddown</u>!
You can't write it?
She doesn't show her tits!!!  She doesn't show her tits.  The breasts symbolize motherhood, the audience...
You didn't see it...
I was walking down the street...I remember, I was writing a...
I got a company...give us a million dollars, put their product in the film.
Well, I've enjoyed it, too.  Any... any...<u>any</u> time...  What does the woman want from life...?
Pay her off.
We got the permit.
She wasn't in...you were al...
Yeah?
Mmm.
I want them thrown in jail.
Well, these things happen.  <u>Purpose</u> of my call, my wife wanted to know what brand of <u>cigarettes</u> Mr. Barrenger smokes, so she could lay some out tonight...we got the list of his dietary <u>requirements</u>...
...the damn thing...
You think so?
Zat true?
I hate wax lips and red ants and pretzels without salt...
I'd rather be with Mommy.
I don't want that to happen.  Why would I want that to happen?
I'm not upset.  Why would I be upset?
What happens when he loves Rachel more than us?
Lord Nelson, Napoleon's troops.  I fear for the women and the property values.
Well, not exactly s...
Well Daddy and I are just friends now, and that's no reason not to wear mascara...
Wow.  Who's that for?
And don't tell her I told you.
You don't like his friends.
And what do you do wh...
He's not even there.  You don't see him, you don't hear him, you're just too much of a woman to bother with little boys.
Thank God.  I got to see you. Grown up.
You forgot to wash my purple shirt.  I told you a hundred times it was Purple Day at school today.
No.  I told you.  I like apple butter not butter butter.
You swore.  You owe me a quarter.  Did you remember my egg carton?  I told you I needed my egg carton for seed planting today.
What I meant and perhaps I didn't say it well was you have a great mom.  You don't need another one.  But when you're at this house --
This is my house too!
The timing was off -- I need this light.
Hold lunch!
You know what that creep and his frogfaced footmen are calling me <u>now</u>?  In front of the whole <u>world</u>? Frosty, the Snow Bitch!!
Here's <u>weak</u>...Mom said she was gonna talk to the <u>teacher</u> and Brad's <u>parents</u>!!  Can you <u>believe</u> the <u>humiliation</u>???
June 3rd, God willing, I'll marry your Dad.  And then I <u>will</u> be your stepmom. And right now, I'm not looking forward to th...
And Mom says anger never, never <u>solves</u> anything.  It makes every- thing <u>worse</u>.
Help me here...
Great.  Big ears, too?
Uh.  What is it?
The guy <u>I</u> see is in the eighth grade at <u>Prep</u> School, and he laughs his <u>ass</u> off every time we talk about you.
Ben!  Oh my Ben!  Are you alright?
Mommy?  It's not Rachel's fault I ran away.
Mommy?
Rache says I have to eat <u>lamb</u>.  I told her <u>you're</u> making me <u>spaghetti</u>!
Of course, you do.  Being magic. Then you know I've got a flu bug, and I turn green and barf profusely when I even think about food.  So, all the more meatballs for you.  But you know what.
That I do.  Always will.
Mommy, if your real name's Jackie and I call you mommy; and Rachel's real name's Rachel...Then when I see her do I say hi Stepmommy?  And if my name's Ben, how come you don't call me son?
Ben where do you have to get to?
You say that like I don't know that.
And when did that pass?
Planning on getting --
Napalm.
Still, please.
We...
The great thing about life is that things keep changing.
What happens next?
Every Tuesday except the 3rd Tuesday of the month when it's switched to Friday except in April when she rides on Thursday.  It's not that hard.  Didn't you have a mother?
Get out!
Annabelle doesn't really want to talk to you right now.
I am not <u>here</u> to make it easier for you.  These are <u>my</u> children.  They don't want to <u>be</u> with you.
Sorry I'm late, I got lost dropping Ben off at Kevin's.
You feeling all right?
My boss.
They came out of my <u>body</u>!
Okay, I'm undeserving.
Moi?
As you may know, 'going out' in the six grade doesn't mean shit.  They don't actually <u>go</u> to a movie or anywhere, they don't even eat lunch together, it's just a declaration to the world that they're...
Can I look at the pictures?
You try to center on the big issues, y'know.  What it's all about.  What this whole trip has meant.  But then, the <u>really</u> big issues keep swamping y...
Hon, maybe your mom would like t...
Hey, you haven't quit on you, I'm sure as hell not gonna.  I just mean, I'm juggling a lot right n...
Now we're going to have a fight, you and I.
You put filth in my child's mouth.
You had her <u>lie</u> about that... that fancy-boy <u>model</u>!
I never wanted to be a mom.  Then, sharing it with you was one thing. Carrying it alone, the rest of my life...
Well, it's the Jack Kennedy Syndrome, huh?  You die young, you always look golden.  Perfect.  The memory kind of burnishes the image, and...
You're lying.
Why didn't I?
You ride with Annabelle...
You know, there's nothing you have to say.  Because they know your heart.  You don't have t...
Really?  Look in your ex-wife's eyes.
Get ready.  To get <u>really</u> mad.
Everything's gonna work out.  The kids and I...we're going to love each other.
Well, I think you should tell him you changed your mi...
What a great surpri...
That's a pretty ugly thing you just said.
'But keep dancing, and if you're lucky, I might just never leave, who knows?'
No.  I'm doing it behind her back.
Something came up.  C'mon Ben! I've got a shoot at three...
We're studying the Holocaust in Social Studies.
There are some rumors...
Well, technically your Zeda is a survivor.
Ahh...tell me. What do you want to do for me? What's your idea?
Maybe it's for the best…I mean, if he was guilty of doing  something wrong…People who are bad should be killed. Don't you think so?
I'm not making fun. I'm showing it as it really is.
Well, I changed the ending a little.
But it won't make any sense if you hear it out of context.
Oh, I know, I know that. Well, sharing your story, your ups and downs, and so forth, can I hope, be an illuminating experience.
Come here, give me a hug!
You have beautiful skin.
Ni...
Nigger, fuck me hard!!...
Who is this?
Toby -? Oh, hi! How are you?
That's good. So then what do you do now?
Pretty cool, Stanley.
Prnceton.
Yeah. He went to Harward.
I said I'll lead.
What now?
Let's move it we got company!
Forget about it.
Looks like you're not going to make that dinner after all...
How's the arm?
Enjoying the tour so far?
I know you're not too happy at this point.  It's too bad we weren't able to meet elsewhere, under different circumstances...
Why the hell didn't you tell us this was at stake!
This was taken when Richter was arrested in Washington state, 1985. He was charged with interstate arms trafficking, skipped bail, and has since been a fugitive.
And--of course there is the human cost, which is incalculable.
What do they have in there that's so valuable?  A cure for AIDS, a cure for cancer?
Chemco makes many things senator! We were under government contract!
KZ...7-0...7-0...nine.  It checks out.
Good.
Get your men to do it!
Just what the hell is he talking about?
Please be calm, Ambassador De Sade.
Where are you trying to reach him?
What's the meaning of this?
Mister Ambassador, what on earth possessed your country to build this weapon?
Damn you, de Sade!  You know as well as I do that this was the act of a mentally sick man - a single individual, whose crack-up can probably be traced to the strains and tensions caused by your country.
Surely, you don't expect us to destroy our weapons without being able to verify that you are doing the same?
Perhaps you gentlemen would like to check with the source?
What are you talking about, Major?
I did that for your own good, fella.  Now I'm not going to pull rank on you.  When this is over, I'll be happy to step outside with you and settle this thing.  Right now my orders are to locate General Ripper and put him on the phone with the President.
Sure I do.  There was some kind of mutiny on the base, and you killed General Ripper.
You must think I'm an awful sap, Major.  Just sit down, fella, and keep your hands on the desk!
Okay, fella.  But just move slow and don't do anything that might surprise me.
Now look, I'm picking up this ordinary telephone.  See?...Hello?...Hello?... Nuts, the lines must still be disconnected.  The General had us disconnect... 
I'm sorry, sir.  General Schmuck is asleep and he isn't taking calls until eight-thirty.
Just a second, sir.  He's got films of the War Room in that thing!
Combat Operations Center, Major Mandrake speaking.
No calls at all.  With or without my say-so. My voice can be imitated too, Major.
You're a good officer, Major, and you're perfectly right to bring these facts to my attention.
General Ripper, can I ask another question?
I see.
But when they do, sir, won't they hit back with everything they've got?
I suppose we might catch them off their guard.
But even then, we wouldn't get everything.  I mean some missiles would abort, or they'd miss their targets, or maybe the enemy have some secret bases we don't know about.
Where, sir?
Yes, sir.  But so do we.
I don't know, sir.  But they're just as anxious to avoid a nuclear war as we are. War just doesn't make sense any more, for anybody.
Go on, Major.
Go on, Major.  You fascinate me.
And you'd like to see that?
Major, those are my boys out there dying.
To peace on earth, Major.
General, now that you've done that, I beg you to recall the Wing.
It was a honest mistake, sir.
I'm afraid so, Mister Presient. Being part of the air-borne alert, each plane is carrying a full load - about fifty megatons apiece.
Well, sir, Plan-R is an emergency plan to be used by lower echelon commanders if higher echelons have been knocked out by a sneak attack.
I don't think that's a fair analogy, sir.
Look, he's there, and you're here.
Yes?
What's the target.
Yeah, to see if we're on our toes.
Give me a first rough course as soon as you can, Lieutenant Ballmuff.
Roger, maintain.
He's right.  They must have clobbered some of our cities already.
Then this is it.
Check.
Missiles!  Sixty miles off, heading in fast.  Steady track, they look like beam riders.
Look, I'm shot - it hurts.
They must have made a visual contact.
Hey, King.  Somebody at Burpelson has a very perverted sense of humor.
Okay.  Check these points.  Complete radio silence.  To ensure that the enemy can't plant false transmissions and fake orders, the CRM-114 is to be switched into all receiver circuits.  The three code letters of the period are to be set on the alphabet dials of the CRM-114, which will in turn block any transmissions other than those preceded by the code letters. You got it?
Lieutenant Toejam, are you ready for Bim and Bam?
Primary arming switch.
I thought I should check out the damage first. My gear is busted up pretty bad.
Yep, it's the CRM-114 code, all right.
Listen, King, old buddy.  On behalf---
In about twenty minutes we start losing height to keep under coastal radar.  Cross in over the coast low-level, continue low- level on zig-zag legs to primary, and climb for bomb run.  Any questions?
What's your point, Lothar?
Master safety.
Yes, Major.
Where'd they get you?
How do you know he's dead?
He's dead, all right.
I don't know what we got left besides Bim and Bam.
There are plenty of traitors and spies running around loose.
Nobody's loyalty is beyond question.  Besides, how do we know one of his staff didn't see it?
Well, it would probably help if you took it ...sort of...straight down.
Thanks, King.  I've always wanted to take one of these big babies in.
It would not be difficult.  Nuclear reactors could provide power almost indefinitely. Greenhouses could maintain plant life. Animals could be bred and slaughtered. A quick survey would have to be made of all the suitable minesites in the country, but I shouldn't be surprised if several hundred thousand of our people could be accomodatedd. Every nation would undoubtedly follow suit.
Uh, yeah, she should be coming by.
Um-hm.
Oh, yeah, you had to go to Highgate. That must've been intense.
Well, you shouldn't drink. Are you gonna drink?
Well, what it was... I, I don't want to admit it, but, you know, I was jealous of Pony.
Yeah!
Slides go with it.
It's called "Burger Manifesto, Part One The Dialectical Expression of Testosterone." Isn't that a great title?
Typical male.
It's really not about anything.
Sounds like a bummer.
No, no, no, no, I don't wanna be stuck with the guy. I want the tickets.
It's your birthday?
No, he's not with a girl.
You know what? He probably gets bored with all that shit.
That sounds so depressing.
A long, long, long...
Go!
You know what we should do? Go to the...
I feel really bad about that, but I was busy, you know, I mean...
No, I know what you're going to say. I don't know anything about making a video. But that's a plus.
But I'd, I'd do it for free. You know, just for my reel.
What?
That's bullshit. That's total utter bullshit.
Fuck her! Come on, let's go.
Yeah.
Sure. You make art and you want people to see it.
I don't think I like that guy's attitude at all. Hey, you know what? Take off the blades. I mean it. I'm gonna break your fucking legs. Take 'em off.
Come on man.
Great.
They are old, we are young, they are fast, we are fun.
Oh, my God, you found it. Thank you so much.  Did you get your tape?
Score! Yeah!
You stand someplace else, man. You stand someplace else. This is our corner. You don't fucking own it!
Yeah, well, uh, you're not so smart, chief, 'cause I'm moving out to L.A.
So tell us, man. Party time, trashin' hotel rooms, babes around the clock?
Whoa!
You okay, man? You okay?
Thanks, man!
So you came by to see how the other half lives, huh? Well, here we are, What do you think? Pretty fucking pathetic huh? Kind of like one of those documentaries on educational TV?
We could still talk, you know? It's nice to talk.
He says we got to be at the radio station at seven a.m. Can you handle that?
Hi, Jeff. Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you Sooze.  Hi, I'm Erica.
Um, mother-daughter.
Buff, sit. You know what I mean though? Somebody ought to crack that guy with a baseball bat.
Actually, the only thing I gotta give that guy is a one-way ticket back to Greaseball-land.
If it's all so fucking futile, what the fuck are you so fucking upset about, fuckhead?
You don't need to sit next to me right now.
Jeff, Jeff, if you want to be alone with Pony, you know, that's, that's fine with us.
Yeah, yeah, I stay at the Four Seas, it's ease.
Wow, you're cute when you're angry.
I mean, you know, at least I admit that I don't know. I know that things are fucked up beyond belief and I know that I have nothing original to say about any of it, alright? I don't have an answer. I don't have a fucking message.
Tim, what are you talking about?
Yeah. Yeah, no, you're right. It's no big deal, you know. Guy probably has his arm around her right now, holding her close, nudging her titty with his elbow, talking about the deep significance of his music, while she looks up at him with her big brown eyes. In a few minutes they'll be back at the Four Seasons. You ever, you ever stayed in one of those places?
No, no, say it like this. Fuck 'em!
Oh, no, no, no. This is no big deal, you know? I can come down and, and get you out.
What? What'd you do?
What'd you do?
They let you out?
Yes.
Why? Because I give a shit?
The sun hasn't even come up yet and you're drinking.
No.
God, I haven't seen you all day.
Of course I do!
God, KAREN JOHNSON.
Can I talk?
Um, because you didn't want to go.
It was a racial incident.
It got that close.
Okay, what would you have done.
Jeff. You know, I was talking to Mister Brooks yesterday. He has this friend in New York who wants to sublet his apartment for six-fifty a month. I could swing that. Six-fifty.
What feelings?
Of course.
Come with me.
No one does nothing, Jeff.
Taking one community college course on the history of Nicaragua, while barely holding a job packing boxes?
Yeah, but that doesn't mean that your tree is not artistic if no one cuts it down.
Come on. I'm not gonna go if you don't come.
Mm. I enjoyed the ride. Sorry you didn't.
Mm-hm.
Oh, yeah?
No, no, I have to talk to you.
Wait, wait, wait a minute, Sooze. What are you doing?
You're unbelievable.
Do your covers and all that shit.
Hey, Pony.
Yeah.
Wow. A gold record, man, that's great. So you're, you're like living the wild life now, huh?
Well, I helped start it, but, you know, uh...
Well, if we're, like, the man invisible, what are you?
Comment, say things, think. Whatever. Why are you so special?
Look, get down off my property.
Look Pakeesa...
You showed up. Oh, my god! Holy shit! Look at this car, man!
So? What's L.A. like?
You do not!
You do not want me to do your cover.
You're not serious.
Jesus, Jeff.
What's that supposed to mean?
Me?
Yeah, you know, when you called I thought, there's a name from the past.
What the fuck are you talking about?!
Well, uh, there's this benefit for Rwanda we're gonna do. And, uh, you know, my songs, uh, where I get the ideas for them, uh, you know, stuff like that.
Where's Erica? You seen her?
You know, man, it's none of your business what I do, okay?
No, see, Neil, if you're fucking with one of my friends, then you're fucking with me.
Yeah?
Hey, great game Friday. Kicked Holbrook's ass, huh?
Make a move. Greasecake. Towel-head.
Buff is funny, okay? She likes Buff, so why don't you whip shut the feminist hole.
I'm going out later.
I'm in, too.
Ahh!  Baby's got two heads!!!
Can you guys believe this?  We're like celebrities!
Hello?
Thanks, Cleo.  See you tomorrow.
Diane?  Diane!
Oh G-d, I'm sorry... You're not really fat!  I was just saying that because, uh, I thought that's what you wanted me to say.
... I don't know.  Probably not.
But, we have to make a smart plan!
Di, it's Luce.  Kansas just called and said she's going to "fuck me up!"  Then I heard coughing, a thud and Kansas had to go.  I think her Grandma had another heart attack.  Anyway, why does she want to "fuck me up?"
I sure do.
If you could be Count Chocula, Frankenberry or Trix the Rabbit, who'd you be?
Madonna.
Hey.  Eyes on your own belly!
She's been the weak tit on this mama cat since the beginning.
Hey, hey, hey.  C'mon you guys.  Obviously that's a little more than our budget will allow.  Basically, we're looking for something around two-hundred dollars.
My daughter's always dreamed of bein' a cheerleader.  Put her on your squad and I'll give you the guns.
You want us to help you pick up?
Hannah, we've...
Screw Lucy!
Is that you down there?
Really...
Yeah.  This summer at church camp?  I'm pretty sure I had, y'know, an orgasm.
All of you!
They could kill you.
I know - that's what I said too. Anyway, we want to help her get some money for the baby by robbing a bank.
Of course you didn't.  You didn't know Norma Desmond as a plucky little girl of seventeen, with more courage and wit and heart than ever came together in one youngster.
Good party.
Walking out on the mob.  What's the big idea?
Carefull Those are dirty words! You sound like a bunch of New York critics.  Thank you, Miss Schaefer.
There's one called....Window... something with a window.
I didn't.
I've got some ideas myself.  One of them being this is New Year's Eve.  How about living it up a little?
You won't.  I'll get us a refill of this awful stuff.
With a wildly beating heart.
Hello, Artie.  Good evening, Miss Schaefer.
Stop it, Artie, will you?  Where have you been keeping your- self? I've got the most wonderful news for you.
I called your agent.  I called the Screen Writers Guild.  Finally your old apartment gave me some Crestview number.  There was always somebody with an accent growling at me.  You were not there.  You were not to be spoken to.  They never heard of you.
I was afraid of that.
Sorry, Miss Schaefer, but I've given up writing on spec.
You sure have.
Psychopaths sell like hotcakes.
Check.
Look, if you don't mind, I haven't got time to listen to the whole plot ...
I mean this is good dialogue along in here.  It'll play.
Look at this street.  All card- board, all hollow, all phoney. All done with mirrors.  I like it better than any street in the world.  Maybe because I used to play here when I was a kid.
From Artie.  What's wrong?
Hello, Betty.
Last time I saw you was someplace very gay.  I remember waving to you. I was dancing on a table.
I'm pretty busy, as you can see...
Yes, I did.
They're dead.  They're finished. There was a time when this busi- ness had the eyes of the whole wide world.  But that wasn't good enough.  Oh, nol They wanted the ears of the world, too.  So they opened their big mouths, and out came talk, talk, talk...
Look at them in the front offices -- the master minds! They took the idols and smashed them.  The Fairbankses and the Chaplins and the Gilberts and the Valentinos. And who have they got now?  Some nobodies -- a lot of pale little frogs croaking pish-poshl
Just a minute, you!
How long is a movie script these days?  I mean, how many pages?
Who else ?
They will love it every place.  Read it.  Read the scene just before she has him killed!
Well?
Of course it is.
Who?  I'd have to have somebody I can trust.  When were you born -- I mean, what sign of the zodiac?
What month?
Maybe I'd better take the rest of the script home and read it -
The name is Gillis.  I'm single.
There sure is.
You know, to me dressing up was always just putting on my dark blue suit.
Shouldn't we wait for the others?
Don't bend back like that.
Hold me tighter.
What are the notes?
Norma, I can't take it.  You've bought me enough.
Keep it.
What's the matter with you?
You're really going to send it to De Mille?
Did she read the script?
How did it go?
No, you're not.  Max! Max!
The rest of the jewelry is in the top drawer.
Norma, you'd be throwing it away. I don't qualify for the job, not any more.
I'm the greatest star of them all.
I made your bed this afternoon.
She was the greatest.  You wouldn't know.  You are too young.  In one week she got seventeen thousand fan letters.  Men would bribe her mani- curist to get clippings from her fingernails.  There was a Maharajah who came all the way from Hyderabad to get one of her stockings.  Later, he strangled himself with it.
What doctor?
Mr. Gillis, if you please.
You see those offices there, Mr. Gillis? They used to be her dressing room, The whole row.
Joseph C. Gillis?
All right, Gillis.  You've got five minutes.  What's your story about?
Forget Romanoff's.  It's the car I'm talking about.  If I lose my car it's like having my legs out off.
Paramount is calling.
I myself was surprised at Mr. de Mille's manners.
What is the scene? Where am I?
Oh, fiddlesticks. What could be dangerous about a baseball game?
Bianca, try not to be so bloodthirsty when you're at the wheel. OK?
Sure glad you didn't let make a monkey of you.
Wait...don't leave me in here...
Let me out. I have to talk to you.
When can I see, you again ?
This is my favourite place in the city.
I'm sorry, I don't understand.
All this talk about love, it's silly.
There's one sure way to find out how you feel.
I thought I'd show you one of my favourite places.
Great! I'II build a house-- right over there, with a veranda looking out to sea. And I'll plant a garden! Papayas, pineapples, bananas, mangoes--- anything'll grow here. And I'II fish in the lagoon, and we can go sailing in a dugout canoe, and---
I don't love you any more.
But what if---it wasn't real?
There's something very dangerous about her. Something evil...
No thanks. I have friends in the resistance. They'll vouch for me. I figure I might get a million bucks for my memoirs.
Hey, I thought you were gonna mention us upstairs.
Guess! Go on.
You sure are a good cook, Selena. Man, that looks too pretty to eat.
Selena, I've been thinking. It's time I settled down---and I don't know a nicer lady to settle down with than you.
Hey, where you going?
Where is your cousin Clark, by the way?
Gosh, what do you suppose .that is?
Oh, Jimmy, can't you forget about your career for one second?
I had to dump the papers in a trashcan. The Danvers have been arrested!
I am almost an adult. This is what I want.
What are you making:
What's a tree?
You see, a tree is a living thing.
I can do that.
There isn't any.
My cousin Clark is my only relative on Earth.
Linda babes! There's this all-night party at Eddie's... his folks are away...
Lucy; come back!
What can I do for you?
Thank you both so much. It was a lovely lunch, Mrs. Danvers. I had a wonderful time. And you're a terrific chess player MR. Danvers.
Ever since I found that thing I've been like a prisoner in a terrible nightmare. You have no idea how awful it is to be mean all the time.
Where is inner space?
Others?
Zaltar, please help me.
Yes, mustn't stop.
Tuesday.
Brad is not a good name for a cocktail.
Hiya, sweet thing.  Little guy's getting' hassled, huh?  Kent, you still here?
Say, Brad. I think he'll be better off doing it his way.
You shouldn't say that, you're the chairman --  ...uh, chairperson...
I can't  Clark already asked me.  Didn't you?  He used to love this song.  Didn't you?  So he just said --  "Would you dance with me?"
I just can't stand this.
It isn't only that he's small for his age. how would you like to be the only kid in town without a father?  Look at him, he's stewed to the gills in the middle of the afternoon.
Me??
And even nicer when there's a man around, Which isn't all that often.
Peanut butter and jelly.
No, I mean Ricky. He's not interested in any of this stuff.
So...how much longer do you think you'll be in Smallville --
I can never get a way from it.
No, well in this case I think I can speak for him.  I mean, I'm pretty close to him, you know.  Superman will be there on Wednesday.
You're the best, Lois.
Name?
Mr. Gorman, according to our records you have been unemployed for 36 weeks.
The only other employment you found was in a fast-food joint--  -- which lasted. . . 28 minutes! Well! That's some kind of record. Talk about fast!
You are, I was about to say, no longer eligible.
They don't actually lose 'em. You can't lose what you never got.
How many sugars?
I believe they're laundered and sent to some charitable institution. I don't know what the heck they do with 'em. Maybe they use them for dust rags, or pen wipers...
Man, what is this?
But Mr. Webster...you're doin' okay with Brazil and them other places. What's wrong with just one little old country doin' their own thing?
Always making yourself beautiful for me, aren't you?  So, Gus, can you make Vulcan do what I want it to? You didn't answer me, pal.  Did you hear about that prison riot last week? It seems they were complaining about rats in the cells...
When?
What?
And do nothing. Just sit there.
And then shut down the pipe lines.
A computer.
But a machine this powerful is going to make powerful enemies. People who will want to destroy it.
I never crash, Gus. That'd be embarrassing.
Thanks.  Let's go
I know, by computers.
What about you?
Ricky?  Where...what...
Oh. I'm Lana Lang. This is Ricky.
What terrific story?
Well, don't let me keep you from anything.
Lots of things...
Ross, honey, it's time for your massage...
I can't see anything.
53.
Mr. White, the next number, please?
It's modern. It's up-to-date. It's state-of-the art.  People, I am in love with this machine.  Go ahead, Mr. White.
85,000 dollars.
Well, chum? What now? Kiss the 85 thou goodbye? Pay some thief's salary while he thinks up new ways to shake the money tree?
It could make weather!
Nice try, Butch,  but it wouldn't be effective against Superman.  You'll see! Now that he's pulled this stunt, he'll stick his nose in my oil scheme and ruin that one, too! I've got to get rid of him! I've got to!
So?
He's the only one who can operate this --
He's coming! He's going to hurt me!
Hostages?
One thousand?? That's an awful lot of oranges. You know there are pill, Lois. I've seen them.
Actually, yes.
Maybe I could try --
Yeah, thanks. . . . I mean, really! Posing as newlyweds to uncover the honeymoon racket in Niagara Falls.  I mean,. imagine wasting a great reporter -  -- uh, reporters -- on this.  Perry White and his Sunday Magazine exposes.
Who ????
You don't have anything to be sorry 	about.  How could I . . .
I didn't think I wanted to.
Let's go to my place.
You did it. You gave it all up for me. I . . . I don't know what to say.
Blood . . . my . . . blood . . .
Don't . . . it's not your fault . . . you didn't know . . .
Hi.
Sleep well?
Me too, Oh, I tried to convince myself, believe me, "It's like being married to a doctor," I said. Doctors are practically never at home. The get emergency calls in the middle of the night and their wives manage to live with it. Then a voice said, " could you be a doctor's wife? Or are you too selfish . . . "
See what happens when I don't have my orange juice?  The human body is only a workable, fairly fragile machine when you treat it with the same respect you'd show to ----  . . . gee . . .
. . . Superman?. . . . .
Don't you watch television? Don't you listen to the radio?
Lex...Lex, how could you do that to Otis?
A parka.
This way Lex.
I can't understand it! Where is he? I mean, he shows up every time a cat gets stuck in a tree, and  now he decides to pull a disappearing act?
Game plan! It's fourth down and long yardage, the two-minute warning sounded and the ball's deep in our territory! How brilliant do you have to be?!
Patience, Kal-El. You begin to sound like an Earthling. SUPERMAN Mother, you speak only of honor, of sacrifice, of responsibility --
And she -- the one you have chosen -- she feels as much for you?
-- as the keeper of the archives of Krypton, it falls to me to tell you of the darkest episode in our planets history.
And so our scientists constructed, from an irreversible mathematical equation, the Phantom Zone. In it we imprisoned these three arch-villains for all eternity.
The one danger we have considered is that the Phantom Zone might - we cannot predict - just might be cracked by a nuclear explosion in space. I cannot say I am glad you asked me that -
Why?
That little black box goes beyond any known conventional radar, it tracks Alpha Waves.
He has powers as we do . . .
Superman! The --
Wait! Don't go in! It's a trap!
There is something more you want. The 								greed is written on your face.
No drinks . No movie. This is the last time I take a charter flight.
Free!
General --- ?
Did you really believe we would give up our advantage?
You're late. Very late.
I've never been in a place like this before.
Maybe I should sit this one out.
He's a jerk. I never noticed it before. Seems like a lot of people I know are jerks . . .  . . . Maybe you think the same thing about me. That's why you keep avoiding me.
Hi. Is dinner ready? I'm famished.
The President is about to speak. I don't think it's going to be good news.
It's just a bad flu, really. How did you know . . .
Superman? Has something happened to him?
But Superman isn't an average man.
And what do we get out of it?
Lex, we all appreciate how you've supported us lately and . . . uh . . . in recognition of your hard work we've decided to increase your commission to 12 percent.
Not so fast!  All trips are canceled. We pay for wire services. And what we don't get from them, we'll invent.
Didn't we have our little talk about personal involvement with the help? Now that you're the publisher . . .
Tone down our headlines? Lacy, that's all the common man reads!
Is he for real?
This letter was addressed to Superman care of me.
What's he going to say?
. . . I look at you, Lenny, and I know how the Romans felt when the barbarians arrived at their city gate.
He missed the door, Uncle Lex.
Gee, Uncle Lex, I don't think this guy's much of a dancer.
The one Superman wrecked up?
Don't worry honey, I'm sure he'll make a swell husband.
Me? Now? With Superman dead and you on my team? It's like I'm the coach and you're the best power forward ever. What could I have to fear?
Your time in prison has twisted you into a delusionary state, Luthor.
But . . . how could you beat him?
But . . . but isn't the world about to be osterized?
Yes, so, well, Werner would've gotten to that too but  --  --  but the XK101 flies only eight feet above the ground...well below the radar limit!  So what? We could have done that soon. We had ways to make people ta-- ways to avoid the radar. And this XK101  -- they think it's so smart that they keep it in 'missile silos' underground. Hah!  We kept many things underground.
You'd better get a new alarm clock. The chief has been hollering for you.
A hot story, huh?
Clark...Son...that...thing you did with the Sheriff today... those...stunts...you don't do those things at school, do you?
Don't worry, Mom. I know.
Mom...
I'd like to.
See? Didn't I tell you this was a tough town?
Stop him, Clark!
Know what?
Thanks, Clark, but I'm booked for the night.
Can I take you to the airport?
Clark Kent, if you had only seen it the way I did, you -
Why would he do that? How would he know I was going to suddenly slip.
Oh, what a chance! If I could just  --  get to him.
You and your real estate.
Speaking of feeding things, what about dinner?
Again???
You're happy, aren't you?
Weak sister.  I still can't figure out why it took so long for you to catch up with us after we all ran out. Y'know?
Ready?
I don't understand.
Then -
Well - gotta change that tire if were gonna get home.
All these years, happy as we've been, how I prayed and prayed He'd see fit to give us a child. And just when I finally accepted my bitter lot...  No one must ever know.
We'll say he's a child to my cousin in North Dakota, and just now orphaned.  Poor thing.
You've been doing some research in the archives.
Lois, the kickback story...
This is incredible. I was just sitting here trying to figure out how to contact you. I mean, you don't have an answering service, right?
Oh, I've got to get some matches.  My cigarette.
Okay. Let's start with these strange powers of yours.
I didn't mean that in any pejorative way.
Well, I mean it's not everybody that can deliver an air mail letter without putting a stamp on it.
Can you actually fly faster than the speed of sound?
I broke the man out of prison --
I gave him this new face.
They're killing me by inches!  Go ahead! Make me suffer! Milk me dry.
Cleaning a rock, Otis?  Jot it down. As soon as we're back, he feeds the pets.
I still don't get it.
What is this??!
At the San Andreas Fault. Maybe you've heard of it.
It would never have worked, Luthor. You are a dreamer  --  a sick, twisted dreamer.
The XK 101. Luthor, that operates on radio waves. And with our fail-safe system, only the President himself can push that button.
Yes, we do know each other.  I'm Alison Jones.
Ally.  That's right.
Yes...fine.
So there were others?
She's in trouble?
I understand.
Mr. Mitchell Stephens, Esquire, would you be likely to sue me if I was to beat you right now?  Beat you so bad that you pissed blood and couldn't walk for a month.  Because that's what I'm about to do.
Hi, Nicole.
They just finished supper.
It just seems...kind of weird.
What do you mean 'outgrown it'?
Goodnight, Mr. Ansel.
Why would he do that?  You didn't have anything to do with the accident.
How is Nicole?  Is she around?
So what brings you out tonight?
I don't see how that concerns you, Billy.
Well, I don't know why it should. There's a whole lot of people in town involved with lawsuits.  We're hardly unique here, Billy.  I mean, I can understand how you feel.
Because it's what we have to do.
If that bastard does subpoena me, if he forces me to go over this again, then all those other lawyers will line up behind him and try and do the same thing.
No, Billy.  We can't drop the lawsuit.  You know how much we need the money.
Nicole's coming over to look after the kids tonight.  She'll be there around six.
What are you thinking?
You're leaving.
...or that the guardrail wasn't strong enough.
Those are all from the fair last year.  Abbott and me were judges at the pet show.
No, nothing like that.  Billy's wife, Lydia, died of cancer a few years ago.  He took over raising the children by himself.  It was obvious how much he missed Lydia.
Abbott and I used to do a lot of that in the spring.
And Billy told you that he'll tell that to...
It's clear to me and other people that you have suffered significantly from this event.
You heard what Abbott said?
Anything you didn't understand?
What happened to summer?
Your Dad spent all his spare time in here.  He wanted to make it absolutely perfect.
No.
The Pied Piper of Hamelin. By famous Hanover city; The river Weser, deep and wide, Washes its wall on the southern side; A pleasanter spot you never spied; But, when begins my ditty...
That's right.
No.  Not mean.  Just...very angry.
I don't want you to lie.
There was nothing reckless in Mrs. Driscoll's behavior?
Note that she said 'pretty clearly'. Not 'clearly'.
That's great, Wendell.  That's the sort of thing I need to know.  So it doesn't come back to haunt our case later on.
Tell me about the Ottos.
Yes.
Is this it?
DADDY!!!
Yes, I'll accept the charges.
Do you have the blood test?
Been drinking since high school. Fucked himself up.  Used to be smart enough.
How does the family survive?
No.  I was alone.  My sister Jenny was sick and stayed home that day.
No.
Yes.
I was scared.
You could see the speedometer?
How do you like it, Nicole?
The door needs a lock.
He's a lawyer.  He's our lawyer.
Well, yes.  He's your lawyer too.
It's because of the accident, Nicole.  Most people in this town whose kids were on the bus have got lawyers.  A lot of people...well, people in this town are very angry. Us included.
Are you sleeping?
Nicole, tomorrow Mr. Stephens wants you to make your deposition at the courthouse.  I thought I'd take you over.
She'll move away.
Well, there's the Hamiltons.  Joe and Shelly Hamilton.
Yeah, well, they probably smoke weed.
Where are we running?  What am I missing here?
Did she accept?
That's a lollipop that, boy.  The kid is only great.
You told him that?
I see Bartha gave you cold tongue for supper.  Hey, wait a minute!
Does he have to be here in our hair?
Mr. Hunsecker, you've got more twists than a barrel of pretzels.
May I lift my eyebrows?  What is this?  What are you trying to do?
But my day with Susie isn't over yet and--
You know, dear, we're drifting apart, you and I, and I don't like that.
Let me finish, dear.  You had your say, now let me have mine...
Susie, I'm sorry if---
I just checked "downtown".  Quiet everywhere tonight.
I know Manny Davis.
I'm a schoolboy - teach me, teach me.
You're picking up my lingo, hon.
Susie, I like this new attitude of yours.  You're growing up and I like it!  I don't like it when you're limp and dependent, when you're odd and wayward.  This gives you a chance for real survival in a very lousy world.  Because, don't forget, dear, you won't always have me with you, will you...?
What does that mean - integrity?
J.J., it's one thing to wear your dog collar...but when it gets to be a noose...I'd rather have my freedom.
I was trying to build her up, not tear her down -
I know...I know you're the strongest cop in town.
What's all the rush?  You said three o'clock.
Who put this item in about the comic?  "If there's a more hilarious funny man around than Herbie Temple at the Palace, you'll have to pardon us for not catching the name.  We were too busy screaming." Does this Temple have a press agent?
Don't tell me you started a polka with Leo Bartha?
Avidly.  He was staring.
Do you think you could do something, Sidney?
Sidney...I...I don't do this sort of thing...
This sort of thing!
Yes, but as a new subscriber you're under no obligation to take more than three books.  And if you mail the enclosed card within ten days --
Did you send my folks in Philly the check...?
Why me...?
Dallas, ask your own manager - he's standing here like a pained wolfhound - Hunsecker and Elwell are enemies to the knife.  So how do you get him doing J.J. a favor?
Frank, you don't listen!  J.J. just told you to shut your mouth!
Did you now?  On which bounce?
And it would cost a pretty penny, huh?
It's not my nature, Susie, but I'll talk to you like an uncle...
I didn't do anything!
Jimmy!  This is a coincidence.  I am just going -
Jimmy, I'm on my way inside right now to talk to Hunsecker.  I can promise you -
Listen, when your band was playing at Roseland -
No more you don't!  What is this - You're showing off for her?  They're supposed to hear you in Korea?
Steve, my brother isn't as bad as he's painted.  He isn't perfect, but -
But he could be reporting back to your brother, couldn't he?
No one's ever stood up to my brother the way you did.
Can I stop by my house?
I'm right here.  I'm fine.  What's the dog's name?
Like it could disguise itself as anything... a pack of cigarettes?
Negative.  She is not a mission priority.
Swear.
"No fate."  No fate but what we make.  My father told her this... I mean I made him memorize it, up in the future, as a message to her -- Never mind.  Okay, the whole thing goes "The future is not set.  There is no fate but what we make for ourselves."
Ready to rock?
John, get out of the way!!
Kyle, don't go!
You broke my arm!
Can it be destroyed?
The man most directly responsible is Miles Bennet Dyson, Director of Special Projects at Cyberdyne Systems Corporation.
Because Skynet knows the Russian counter-strike will remove its enemies here.
I must be destroyed.
It's finally over.
On August 29th 1997 it's going to feel pretty fucking real to you, too!  Anybody not wearing number two million sunblock in gonna have a real bad day, get it?
Oh! And don't wave your hands about!
Don't see me to my door, there's no need.
Yesterday I read that Furtwängler was asked to lead the New York Philharmonic back in '36, Toscanini suggested it. Had he accepted, he would have become the most celebrated conductor in America.
'Please remember that Dr. Furtwängler risked his life to help anyone who asked him. I personally testify to having seen literally hundreds of people lined up outside his dressing room after concerts to ask for his help. He never turned anyone away. After he heard me play... I am a violinist... he gave me money because I was unable to feed myself or my family and then he helped me to escape to Sweden. He helped countless people in similar ways.'
Okay, better question the next witness. I bet you a bottle of French champagne he tells us the baton story inside ten minutes.
Yes, David?
Isn't it true that before every concert you got a woman in your dressing room and gave her the old conductor's baton, isn't that true?
Major, he may just be the greatest conductor of this century and that merits respect.
So, Major, tell me, have you questioned Dr. Furtwängler?
I was in Vienna. I had with me an Austrian chauffeur, Max his name was, he spent time in the camps. We were looking at these Viennese cleaning up the bomb damage, scavenging for rotting food, butt ends, anything. I said, 'To think a million of these people came out to welcome Adolf on the day he entered the city, a million of 'em, and now look at 'em.'  And Max said, 'Oh, not these people, Major. These people were all at home hiding Jews in their attics.' You get the point, Colonel? The point is they're all full of shit.
Colonel. He had no sisters, no brothers, only a lot of love affairs.
This is what I'm saying. He must have had Party contacts.
You do shorthand and typing?
Okay, let's see. How long were you in the camp for?
Says here because of your father. What's that mean?
Think you can get me any of that?
I can't do this. It's not right.
Could you tell us about being made a Prussian Privy Councillor. How did that happen to a non-Party member?
I made no deal!
I keep hearing you helped a lot of Jews to escape. How did you do that?
Did you call someone you knew?
Sure.
Your guess is as good as mine.
When I last saw you, I was unprepared. I did not know what to expect. In these past weeks, I have been thinking more carefully and making some notes.  You have to understand who I am and what I am. I am a musician and I believe in music. I am an artist and I believe in art. Art in general, and music, in particular, has for me mystical powers which nurture man's spiritual needs. I must confess, however, to being extremely naive.  I insisted for many years on the absolute separation of art and politics. My entire life was devoted to music because, and this is very important, because I thought that I could, through music, do something practical.
What telegram?
No, because I had only one intention. My only intention whatever I did was to show that music means more than politics.
That's an outrageous lie!
Well. Once he said he'd read what this man wrote about me.
He said, 'Don't mind him. His job is to criticise, your job is to conduct.'
Please stop playing these games with me. Why you should bring up the name of another conductor is beyond my understanding.
I have illegitimate children.
I believe that. But just answer the question, don't give me explanations.
Do you know what that is?
Have you ever smelled burning flesh? I smelt it four miles away. Four miles away, I smelt it. Have you ever seen the gas chambers, the crematoria? Have you seen the mounds of rotting corpses? You talk to me about culture, art and music? You putting that in the scales, Wilhelm? You setting culture, art and music against the millions put to death by your pals? They had orchestras in the camps. They played Beethoven, Wagner. The hangmen were playing chamber music at home with their families. I don't understand the Germans' relationship with music. What do you need music for? Your pals you could call to save a few Jews when millions of them were being annihilated? Yes, I blame you for not getting hanged, I blame you for your cowardice. You strutted and swaggered, you fucking piece of shit, king-pin in a shithouse. You talk to me about walking a tightrope between exile and the gallows, and I say to you, lies!
Helmuth Alfred Rode. Second violinist since 1935. What's it mean, second violinist?
I hear the British have his... his archive, files, records.
It's Dr. Furtwängler's baton, which I stole.
Yes, you remember.
What?
Was a member of...?  Speak up?
Oh, I see, he made you co-operate. And now are you a communist again?
I can give you freedom of movement, freedom to work, freedom, Helmuth. But I need something in return.
The only thing I know is he's an anti-Semite.
Oh! The evening before, I see...
So, you never heard of him.
No, I was never a Nazi, I have no interest in politics, I'm a musician -
Yes, that's true, but he refused to give the Nazi salute. He kept his baton in his right hand. In Hitler's presence. That was a brave act...
Here you go.  You're a Bob's Girl now.  Nancy will check you out.
Great.
Not lately.  Did you check messages?
I haven't seen you in here lately, Mr. Miller.
Do you understand?
Pay attention.  The 600 series had rubber skin. We spotted them easy.  But these are new.  They look human.  Sweat, bad breath, everything.  Very hard to spot.  I had to wait 'til he moved on you before I could zero him.
--everythingis gone.  Just gone.  There were survivors. Here.  There.  Nobody knew who started it.  It was the machines.
Didn't see the war.  I was born after, in the ruins.  Grew up there.  Starving.  Hiding from the H-K's.
We gotta get you to a doctor.
This is gonna make me puke. Talk about something.
You volunteered?
About what?
I'm dying for a shower.  You could use one too.  And we'd better check that bandage.
Don't say that.
Kyle, the women in your time...what were they like?
So much pain.
I bet you're ticklish.
I don't think I like this.
I see.  And this...computer, thinks it can win by killing the mother of its enemy, kill- ing him, in effect, before he is even conceived?  A sort of retroactive abortion?
...look, Lieutenant...uh, Vukovich, don't put me on hold and don't transfer me to another department...
Here's her driver's license.
Send a unit.
That Silberman just crack me up.  He had this guy in here last week who set his Afghan on fire. Screwed it first, then set it on--
Admittedly...
Did you play recently?
Clean out your locker.
Don't help me, just get more napkins. And soda water.
Terrific.  I now have a hundred dollar dry cleaning bill.
Do you know what to do?
It's run by a company... they play elaborate pranks.  Things like this. I'm really only now finding out myself.
The lights went out, one hundred people all ran away...
Where'd you all go?  Motherfucking frat boys.  You better hide.  Is your life so pathetic that this is something you're willing to pay for?
I'll give you a boost.
This is C.R.S.
There goes a thousand dollars.
Never did catch your name.
That's classic.
Where are we going?
Didn't think I'd ever see you again.
Okay.
What is this!?
Who is it?
Get us out of here...
It wasn't you.  It wasn't personal...
Where'd you get that... ?
Guess you missed it.
Listen very carefully, I'm telling the truth... this is the game.  This was all the game.
What did you <u>really see</u>?  This whole time... special effects, squibs, like in the movies.  Please, you've got to believe me...  He's got a gun, with real bullets!
Think about it!  They followed you every step of the way.  There was always a safety net.  The taxi, there was a diver.  At my house, the window was rigged... they shot at us with blanks...
Open that door, you'll see.  Your brother's there... Conrad.  He's there.  It's your birthday party...
There's another gig starting in Saudi Arabia.  I'm just a walk-on this time though.  Bit-part.
Originally, Connecticut.
Julliard, yeah.
About me?
Divorced.  Remarried to some pediatrician or gynecologist, or pediatric gynaecologist, in Sausalito.
You need anything?
Call that number.
But, will you?
How do you mean, exactly?
Slow down, take a breath...
What have they been doing to you?
What happened was, I'm on vacation, alone... I was robbed, at gunpoint. They hit me and ran.  Two men, a few blocks away.  They took my wallet, money... all of it.  So...
How much is it?  A few thousand, at least.  A Rolex like that... lucky for you they missed it.
The last few days, um... I've been thinking... had a lot of spare time.  I want to tell you... I'm starting to understand why you left me.  I've been resenting you for it, maybe, but ... I want to apologize, for all of it.  For shutting you out, for not being there.  I...  Anyway, I hope you can forgive me.
It's just a t.v.  He's just an actor.
V-A-N... O-R-T-O-N...  A gift from Conrad Van Orton. Interesting...
Your brother was a client with our London branch.  We do a sort of informal scoring.  His numbers were outstanding.  Sure you're not hungry at all... ? Tung Hoy, best in Chinatown...
I don't write the questions.  I just review them.
We want a sense of your overall capabilities, limitations, turn-ons, turn-offs...
Oh... it's a game.
Sorry to keep you waiting.
It's never happened.  We've never had an unsatisfied customer.
Goddamnit, why do they do that?
Where'd you pick up your checks?
Guess!
Show Mr. Van Orton to his room.
Thank you.
What makes you ask?
Not much, I think.
What's this about?
The Hinchberger wedding.
Your ex-wife.
What gentleman, Maria?
"Under the Bleachers"... by Seymour Butts.
Look... what I'm doing is none of your business...
I wasn't expecting you.
What's happened...
Someone's playing hardball.  It's complicated.  Can I ask a favor?
Very well.  If you tell me not to worry, I shan't.
Bravo, young man.  you have to tell me what this was all about sometime.  I want you to know... when it looked there for awhile like you were going slowly insane... I was fully prepared to have you committed to the <u>finest</u> mental-health facility available.  I mean that sincerely, don't thank me.
Hi.  I'm Todd Aubochon.
Couldn't get the last ones.  You?
Welcome Home Eleanor.  Welcome Home?  I've never been here.  Who did this?
Luke, can I talk to you?
Because... well, I know I can trust you.
Do you need me anymore?  Cause I'm going to bed.  They can stay up talking another 45 minutes if they want, but I gotta try to get some sleep.
I gave my key to the gate to Todd, but the Dudleys'll be here in the morning.
Is that the question of compassion or science?
Hey!  I heard screaming...
You used the wrong test.
Was sure she'd be in here.
It's still an electric shock!
Malcolm, this is essential work I'm doing.  Just think what my research can do for education. Elementary school classrooms near train tracks or airports, where loud noise is random; this helps to prove the need for sound insulation if the children are ever going to learn to read.
No, Malcolm!  Individual performance is only part of it.  I know why baseball players choke for no reason, I know why violinists throw up with fear before every concert, and need to, to give a great performance, but what I want to know is, how fear works in a group...
You wrote that you had trouble sleeping.
Sorry.
So... smell... is... Smell is the sense that triggers the most powerful memories.  And a memory can trigger a smell.
Let's say it wasn't you.  Who did it?
It was a stupid thing to do.
Nell... please, Nell... take a deep breath...
I hadn't done a study of how group fear affects individual performance.  Mass hysteria is like a story, Nell.  A communal story.  Someone starts it.  Then we all add a little more to it. And then for some reason -- no one knows how -- we start believing it.  This story shapes what we see and hear.  We interpret everything through it, make it fit the story. I started our story when I gave you the history of Hill House. You've added to it.  That's what this experiment has all been about.  That's what it was about, the experiment's over.  I'm pulling the plug.  This is my fault.
You know what he's really upset about?
You hear the vibrations in the wire.  There's a magnetic pulse in the wires, you feel it.  I could test it.
Here's how they're organized. Groups of five, very different personalities: scored all over the Kiersey Temperament Sorter just like you asked for.  And they all score high on the insomnia charts.
This is where we're going?
What happened?
Get a blanket!
Oh God, we can't get out!
Why?
You've been out of the world for a long time, haven't you?
Good night, Theo.
Watts?
David?
Why?
You want to move to New York, you want to move in with me?
My place isn't like yours, Nell, it doesn't have a view of sea.  It doesn't have a view of anything. What's interesting about the way I live is what goes on inside the walls.  Living with me... My boundaries aren't very well defined, Nell.  Do you know what I mean?
Are you sure?
They're all in here.  All the ones he killed.  They're just children! We have to help them!
Not for you, clearly.
I'm not.
As soon as you get dressed.
The freeway's faster, but lacks a certain majesty.
Same as last time -- the rest after.
When you find the guy, you'll know.
Fuck you.
You're in gun country now, my friend.
I can take care of the paperwork.
Man knows what he likes.
That's a high-end item.  Total reliability.
I didn't even know who I was writing to -- just someone with the same last name. She never talked about any family.
I knew when I was droppin' that letter into the mail slot it was gonna come back and smack me in the face.  I did my time, okay?  My sister, her ol' man's up in Chino right now doin' eight years.
You should talk to Elaine.  That was her best friend.
I already told you, man.  Corcoran.  Know what that is?  State prison.
Told you you wouldn't be able to see through that gate.
Who'd you butcher at the house?
Has he?
What's so fucking funny?
What are we standing on?
Too easy?
I've been wondering something.
Useless gits.  I was gonna do the Post Office once.
Sort a few things out.
... No, I went in for more improving pastimes.  Philosophy classes, language courses, European history, all that lark. Did you know that in Paris in the Eighteenth Century there were more rats in people's houses than there were people in people's houses.
You weren't disappointed in her, then.
I might've been away for the weekend.
Who's Mr. Lindgren?
What line is he in.
Are you serious.
You fuckin' guys and your dicks.
You don't believe it was a car accident.
Terry's never going to give you satisfaction.  Not the type.
On what.  What makes you so certain.
Jenny was supposed to come to my place that night.  She called me, asked if she could come over.  She and Terry had been -- having some trouble.  Lately.  I don't know about what.  On this occasion, it reached some sort of crisis point.
How did you come to have my address? Found it, did you.  Among her things.
Tell us about it.
Oh, I was gonna say ...
I was inside once.  I punched a cop at a demo.
Who remembers.
Not that I recall.
Nah -- she was married to me grandad -- he was as bent as a boomerang -- used to make knuckle-dusters down the shop. Crafty old sod.
I got a steady income -- I'm on the dole.
Last time might as well've been the first.  I remember all the times, don't I.  Watching her grow up --  in increments.
She used to tell me she'd turn me in.  Little kid.  Ten year old.  "If you're naughty, Dad, I'll tell on ya."  She didn't want me sent down again, see. When I was planning some job.  "I'll tell 'em, Dad, I promise I will.  Here, look, I'm calling the Old Bill right now" -- picking up the telephone.  I can see her, the phone in her hand.  Became a sort of joke between us.  Only it wasn't a joke.
Never thought of that.  Busman's holiday.
That's where Valentine's scarpered.
Yeah, I guess you are.
But if you're mad at him too and he's mad at you ... that must make us pals.
Yeah, that's right.
Been away a lot.
Out on a oil rig.  In the North Sea. Nine years.
I had to, didn't I.  Nothing else for it. Then just when I'd finished my nine years -- my contract -- wallop, I had to bugger off to the States.
Which kind?
Ever take a look at the women who work in pet stores?  Wow.
Two blacks and a Mexican in a car.  Who's driving?
Straight rotation, no shit, call your shot.
You do?
You walked.  What the hell are you doing here.
I miss my kids.
Is he here?
You must know Ian.
What.
...You don't like the music out there?
Hi, Mr Crane.
Yeah.
That's swell. However, the music, if you want to pursue it, well, the lessons from Mrs Swan, they'll only take you so far. There's this guy in San Francisco, I've made inquiries, everybody says he's the best. Trained lots of people who've gone on to have big concert careers, symphony orchestras, the works. His name is Jacques Carcanogues. I'm not sure I'm pronouncing it right. Anyway, he's a Frenchman.
You've got talent, anyone could see that. And he's the best. If he thinks a student has talent, he'll take 'em on for next to nothing. You're a cinch to be accepted, I could cover the cost of the lessons, like I said, it's pretty modest--
...I stank, didn't I?
I speak to you on ze phone, non? You have a special interest in music?
Is not so hard to understand. Her playing, very polite.
Sure.
Do? Hell, nothing. Well, you'll want to keep tabs on your investment, of course, but I'm looking for a silent partner. I've done the research, I've contacted the vendors, the deal is set. I'm just looking for venture capital, friend. Disappear if you want, check in whenever you like--I want the dough; I don't take attendance.
Right! Strictly business.
...You bring a check?
All right.
She's a rare one.
How much to they want, Dave?
Please, Ed.
...Doesn't become a matter of public record unless there's foul play. However. I don't believe I'm *prohibited* from telling you this. I guess I'm not obliged to tell you, either. I don't exactly know.  But if *I* were the man, I'd want to be told.
Where you going?
...What a knucklehead.
...I don't get it.
...how I was too ordinary to be the criminal mastermind the D.A. made me out to be, how there was some greater scheme at work that the state had yet to unravel, and he threw in some of the old truth stuff he hadn't had a chance to trot out for Doris...
...and inflame the passions of these twelve fine men and women...
Yeah. What do I, uh...
...So, uh, who should I--
Yeah.
...Ed?
The point is there's a certain art to the process. The point is not merely to provide, and let me point out, these fish are not as dumb as you might think.
This hair.
This is what family is for, Ed! This is when ya come together!
They're just people like you and me, Ed. Remember that.
I don't understand.
...I'm Crane.
Hello!
Yes, sir.
He's a barber.
Are you awake?... Is he awake?
Beauregard!  You scared me half to death.
Don't know if it'll do any good, Mr. Cuthbert.
We all love the museum.  I come here myself with my kids.  We're trying to work with you.
Pendergast may be in trouble.  Don't you understand?  He still hasn't come back.  It's been over three hours --
I got it after I was mugged in the subway last spring.
Forget it!
Fifteen... what's next?
D'Agosta?  Ippolito.  Come in.
Who are you?  The undertaker?
An original Roger Tory Peterson of a Red-Breasted Merganser.  Amazing.  I have a copy of this in my office at home.
If you don't mind, this could be important.
How big is the sub-basement?
This place is a maze.
What's that?
Dear God.  Where are we, Lieutenant?
Curious.  There's something missing.
Yes.  Bit of a shock.  But as Cuthbert so tactfully put it, the museum needs new blood.  And since I've been here since the Mesozoic Era --
Please.  Don't humiliate me further.
This isn't a death sentence.  Greg has promised to teach me fly fishing.  I'll garden.  I'll write.
Look at this.  An ambyloid reovirus protein.  That explains why the computer's confused.  The plant's infected with a virus.
And it's hungry.  It's been two days since it's eaten.  There are five hundred people arriving right now. The animal hunts at night and it has a keen sense of smell!  All those people in one enclosed space...
What's that?
Dr. Frock?
Something tried to get into this room!
This means there must be an animal loose in the museum!
What's that?
Dr. Frock, I was wondering.  What happened to the rest of Whittlesley's plants?
You work here?
Quiet!
We were just lost, okay?  And we went down this curvy staircase.  At the bottom was a big shadow.
It had a long tongue, teeth this big and yellow eyes.
Stop!
Oh no.  I smell it.
If I spent half the time on my Fractal Evolution thesis that I spend on this fly rod, I'd have my PhD.
I have the species identification on these teeth.  We can extract DNA and start running tests on the extrapolator program.  Call Dr. Frock.  He wanted a demonstration.
Is Dr. Frock safe!
Not today.  Besides, I think the director of the museum is expecting you.
Special Agent Pendergast.  FBI. Forgive me.  I guess I was snooping. What is this?
How does it work?
Somehow, when all this happened... I knew it would come back to John.  Is he really dead?
That was two years ago.  John was still in love with me.  He wouldn't leave me alone.
No.  I'm all right.  I won't let this affect me anymore.  John wouldn't get help.  His ego endangered the lives of others.  His theory came first.
My God.  Then it was an animal.
What happened?
That's not what I saw.
Dr. Green...
Genetic damage?
I don't know how to deal with this. It's hellish.  Like nothing I ever saw.  I'm not trained to deal with a monster, a supernatural creature like that.
You'd slow us down and put Margo in danger.
We have to try and draw it off!
That's a ptarmigan, feigning a broken wing.  The bird pretends to be injured to draw the fox away from its nest!
You smell that?
No!  Don't kill him!  Pendergast, you were right.  It's John!
I don't believe it.
I'm so glad to see you.  What's the occasion?
I'm sorry.  I don't have anything for at least a month.
Welcome.
Of course, there hasn't been anything to compare with this - the first time an intruder has been a former cast member--
Let's talk ratings.  "Truman" has always enjoyed top ten status but the huge surge over the last few days--how do you hope to sustain that audience now that Truman appears to have reconciled himself?
We find many viewers leave him on all night for comfort.  Haven't you ever watched your child or your lover sleep?
Are we talking Emmies?
There's nothing on the show I don't use myself.
We've learnt about life as Truman has and, despite the complaints of a minority, it's been an overwhelmingly positive experience, for Truman and for the viewing public.
No...I, er.
Actually, I'm free Sunday.
It's beautiful!  What are you waiting for?
Truman, you know, I did think about moving away one time.
I've got to talk to you.
Well, what do you think?
How did it go today?
Oh, God.
I'll take you home, Angela.  Why don't you leave those with us for a while?
--we need more charcoal.
That's right.  I do, don't I?
Blocked at every turn.  Beautifully synchronized, don't you agree?
Let me get you some help, Truman.  You're not well.
What the hell has that got to do with anything?  Tell me what's happening?!
Stop this now.  I'll do it.  I swear.
You look very pale, Truman.  Are you taking your vitamin D's?
--Darling--
We ought to be getting you back, Mother.
Is there any way around?
They're going to stop me talking to you.
Just listen.  You remember when you were a little boy, you stood up in class and said you wanted to be an explorer like Magellan--
Well, we're FBI agents.
What do you do?
I need your clothes, Byers.
What is it you find incredible?
No, they don't.
Its effect on the host has changed. The virus no longer just invades the brain as a controlling organism. It's developed a way to modify the host body.
Do they know?
Who?
You want a call if we turn up Kurtzweil?
I'm looking for anything out of the ordinary. Maybe something from the FEMA offices where the bodies were found.
Have you examined them?
How's that?
And what's that?
And they tell me I'm paranoid.
How can I reach you?
You found something?
What?
-- You saw this experiment?
You told me you had answers.
You didn't know my father --
You'd be shit out of luck if not for me. You saw what you saw because I led you to it. I'm putting my ass on the line for you.
Mulder -- it's me --
Now what?
Scully...
Where are you, Mulder?
They're trying to divide us on this, Scully. We can't let them.
They were the ones that put us together.
This isn't about you, Scully. They're doing this to me.
Are you drunk, Mulder?
Mulder, this is going to take some time, and somebody's going to figure out soon enough we're not even supposed to be here.  I'm in serious violation of medical ethics.
Why are you whispering?
This looks like new grass to you?
What are my choices?
That bomb in Dallas was allowed to go off, to hide something: bodies infected with a virus you detected yourself.
Yeah, well they may this one.
This virus -- it... 
Why was I assigned to you? To debunk your work. To reign you in. To shut you down.
What? What happened?
-- They're asking her for a narrative. They want to know why she was in the wrong building.
You don't see what's going on here, do you?  There's four hundred million dollars in damage to the city of Dallas. Lives have been lost. No suspects have been named. So the story being shaped is this could have been prevented. That the FBI didn't do its job.
Agent Mulder --
Are we being watched?
What is it?
You're lying.
This is what you've been conspiring to conceal? A disease?
Until Dallas, we believed the virus was simply a controlling organism. That mass infection would make us a slave race.
Let me out. Stop the car.
The vaccine you hold is the only defense against the virus. Its introduction into an alien environment may have the power to destroy the delicate plans we've so assiduously protected for the last fifty years.  Or it may not.
We've allowed this man his freedom. His books have actually helped us to facilitate plausible denial. Has he outlived his usefulness to us?
Did we go sailing?
He hates me.
I do it all the time!
Good.  We need you healthy and relaxed. You're going to eat well, meditate, exercise, and watch mindless television.
Catherine?  I'm about to start.  If you want me to wait, or...
There's always a chance they'll confess.
Agent Novak?
Absolutely.  I suppose everyone does.
With Stargher I saw things...
What about Julia?
This is Stargher we're talking about?
Remember, Julia Hickson is priority number one.  Nothing else matters.  Find out where she is.
Where the hell are we?
COME ON!
I heard Julia and John got married.
He's mine?
They're hungry.
Thank you.
Who says?
Oh no... No you don't.
Shouldn't we get a catheter in him?
I hate to admit it, but there's something perversely satisfying about this.
How is she?
Here he is.
Breeders typically destroy albino pups, so this animal is truly unique.
Right here.
Ich weiss nicht.
Well, I saw you at the funeral.
Don't understand what Harry saw in a fellow like that.
He said he remembered me too. Seems to show he wasn't in much pain.
What's she talking about?
Anything really wrong with your papers?
H-E-Z-T...
Tell me about him.
Oh, that was many years ago.
...and buried him.
Well, I didn't learn that from him.
Let's go away.
Wer ist da?
Have you seen Calloway?
Are you going, too?
Oh, well.
...anyway?
Nichts danke. Kein.
Must you take those letters? CALLOWAY Yes, I'm afraid so.
They'll be returned to you, Miss Schmidt, as soon as they've been examined.
You know as much as I do, Miss Schmidt - you were intimate with Lime, weren't you?
In one of his letters he asked you to telephone - a good friend of his called Joseph. He gave you the number of the Casanova Club. That is where a lot of friends of Lime used to go.
Vienna is a closed city, Miss Schmidt, he can't get away.
Here we are. You'll be all right here, Miss.
Yes.
I would very much like to meet you, Baron. Come around.
Where?
What is it?
Please keep this passport to yourself, until I make some inquiries, will you, Major?
My name is Calloway.
Been here long?
I'm afraid I've never heard of you. What's your name again?
Must have known I was broke. Even sent me an airplane ticket. It's a shame.
Listen, Callaghan.
...expense.
And there was a third man there. I suppose that doesn't sound peculiar to you.
Tactful too, aren't we, Callaghan?
Miss Schmidt.
What do you want to see a doctor for, huh?
Well?
...a week ago.
I followed his shadow until suddenly...
This is where he vanished.
Fifty yards right down there.
I tell you I heard him running ahead of me.
It wouldn't work.
Calloway!
What time is it?
Be sensible, Martins.
...of Santa Fe."
They wouldn't know me.
I was going to stay with him, but he died Thursday.
Seems exciting.
Oh, Mr. Martins, good evening.
Mr. Crabbin.
Hello, Harry.
What can I do, old man, I'm dead, aren't I?
I'm only safe in the Russian Zone... I'm safe as long as they can use me...
Have you ever seen any of your victims?
You really liked it?
...you know and all that.
...you.
Not necessarily. She'd probably want to help.
Not yet.
Mr. Popescu is here tonight.
Find out?
You remember me? Upstairs...
Happened...Yes happened right down there.
You gotta tell your story to the police.
Fer von mir aus gehen sie zur gansalt aber mich lassen sie aus mit der politzei.
Something wrong.
What else did he tell you?
Mr. Martins...
...Mr. Martins?
I'm Daffy.
Thank you, sir. Thank you. I promise I will repay you.
You. You're the guy that lent me the money.
It would be nice though, if there was a place like that. You know, that no one could get to.
Oh. Great. Not far at all. I don't like to be negative, but do you think we should let someone know where we're going?
I don't know - I'm American.
Richard - I saw a fin!
Well what the fuck do you expect me to do about it.
She is gone!
What about Moliere?
He tried to borrow money from us.
Did you sleep well?
Hi.
Have you told someone?
No one follows that midrash.
They're racist, they're militaristic, they act like bullyboys in the territories....
Fucking Danny, man...
That was an ark, man. That was a Torah. They fucked around with it, and the Torah melted their faces.
What do you think you're doing?
Do we have to listen to this shit?
Where did you read this? Robert Faurisson?
What do you care?
Fuck you. I hate the Jews at least as much as you do.
You write that?  Come work for me. You've got a lot to learn; I can teach it to you.
You will.
Have you read Toynbee? Spengler?
Where'd you read all that stuff?
Why no silencer?
You think people ever commit suicide out of happiness?
I bet. He didn't realize that nobody who talks such a good game ever plays one.
I want to learn to read it.
They think it's the word of God, and it's holy, and the flesh isn't....
Where are they?
With you there's a tragic dimension.
V'asitem lechem pessel to-monat. And make no graven image of the Lord, or the form of any figure, or of man or woman, or beast or fowl or fish or anything that looks like anything. Because He's not like anything. Not only can't you see Him or hear Him, you can't even think about Him. I mean, what's the difference between that and Him not existing?
Christianity's silly, but at least there's something to believe in. Or not believe. Judaism there's nothing.
Plus you have nothing else to do all day.
What...? You think I'm Jewish?
He commands it whether He exists or not...  Look, we can fight him and be crushed. Or we can submit.
I thought there were people here....
Shema yisrael adonai elohenu adonai echod.
More cultural than political.
Totally. The family emigrated from Bulgaria when he was eleven.
I'm sure they are. But what do we accomplish by pointing it out?
My mother's family is French, my father's was German, originally.
And? WHat did you notice?
Jewish girls like to give head, right?
Notice the Israelis: a fundamentally secular society. They no longer need Judaism because they have soil. The real Jew is a wanderer, a nomad. He has no roots, no attachments. So he "universalizes" everything. He can't hammer a nail, plow a field. He can only buy and sell, invest capital, manipulate markets. He takes the life of a people rooted in soil and turns it into a cosmopolitan culture based on books, ideas, numbers. This is his strength....  Take the great Jewish minds: Marx, Freud, Einstein. What have they given us: communism, infantile sexuality and the atom bomb. In a mere three centuries since these guys emerged from the ghettos of Europe, they've taken us from a world built on order and reason and hurled us into a chaos of class warfare, irrational urges and relativity, a world where the very existence of matter and meaning is in doubt. Why? Because it is the deepest impulse of the Jewish soul to unravel the very fabric of life until nothing is left but thread, nothing but nothingness. Nothingness without end...
Who? How would I know him?
Were you ever bar mitzvahed anywhere else?
That's what I'm trying to find out, Danny. Who am I fucking with here?
Why would Nadelman lie?
How do you reconcile the two?
You know the joke: a Jew's shipwrecked on a desert island. When they rescue him, they see he's built two synagogues. They say, for vhat do you need two synagogues? He says, vun to pray in, and vun I'd never set foot in so long as I live, so help me God.  You pray in the one you'd never set foot in...and vice versa.
Which <i>Times</i> guy?
How did you get the fucking number?
I don't do that.
Balint?
Hello...?
Beth Shalom? What are you talking about? Who is this...?
But it's stupid, right? You admit it's stupid.
You can have chicken with eggs but not with milk. Why is that?
What is it?
That's all we've got left.
Oh, what is this shit?
Not too fast.
She's at Yale Law -- interning with the district attorney...  We're getting married next spring. In Israel.
Danny, listen, people expect me to daven; they don't want someone they don't know -- leading their prayers.
SO THEY SHOT HIM! SO HE WAS DEAD. SO WHAT. HE'S WORSE THAN DEAD NOW. HE'S A PIECE OF SHIT...
Where do you think you're going?
After your mother died, that's when you stopped going to shul. Doing your homework. Everything.
We want you to help run it. Give speeches, lead seminars... Handle the fund-raising.
Are you out of your mind?!
What do you mean?
I was thinking of something kinda stupid last night.  You know those women in the greek mythology that made love with the Gods.  Take Leda for example, sleeping with Jupiter, who came to earth as a swan... Well, can you imagine Leda announcing to her swan "You're going to be a father, my little chick-a-dee"?
Johana, am I boring you?
My God!  I'm glad I didn't go.
Listen, I just found out we've got real problems in Sicily!
No!
This is a great pleasure.
Where did you two meet?
He looks me in the eye like some fuckin' gold fish, and says:  "I'm going to beat you".
... It's easy.  You go down.  You come up.  ... Right, Johana?
... It's a comfortable place.
What else is there?
How did it happen?
Ten thousand.
In my village, we have a saying: when the wind blows, the flags of all nations flap in the same direction.
Roberto?  How long?
Enzo, what are you going to do with the money?
You don't mind if I go instead, do you?
Well, what are they?
Enzo?
Two years younger than you.
Hey!  Will you slow down!  When did you learn how to drive?
You don't have that one, do you?
... How long was I asleep?
... Push me back in the water...
Thanks for helping with the bag.  It looks great!
Please move slowly, you're rocking the boat.
You jumped in?
Just checking up on your family.  I guess I was drunker than I thought and the idea of going back to my hotel in a wet dress... Well...
... No?
How can you tell it's a female?
Because one shouldn't fall in love with creatures from the sea.
Hello?
Well, then, talk to me some more.
And you?
You want to lie down for a while?
Why?
This is the hotel San Domenico?
... And the new stereo.
I thought you said he was Peruvian?
... And those?
But doesn't Jacques dive without anything?
You've made me a happy insurance person.
A settlement completely demolished, ten smashed army jeeps, four dead Arabs. G dash D damn it, Hammer! You think you're above the Ten Commandments? Just find Santa Claus and bring him back to us. No heroics, got it?
I guess I could be chalant about it, but then again I'm not even sure if that's a word. Listen Chief, we could stand around arguing all day, but I gotta case to crack.
So. Do you have a name?
What are we going to do? We're at least an hour from the front.
That got annoying fairly quickly.
What!?
I want for our children to go to private schools and take music lessons. Little Abraham will go to Stanford for college, Batya will go Ivy League, maybe Vassar.
What are you doing here?
Esther!
You two know each other?
Mom, I have a real job. I do good things for this community. I help people.
...and their children will all be able to eat latkes and spin dreidels, and light the menorah with the knowl...
Hello Mazel Tov! A boojee boojee boojee boo...
Okay, what's the information?
You watch your back Hammer. Hanukkah might just be his first move. For all we know Kwanzaa could be next. There's a lot of brothers counting on you. If you fail...
Wait! Before we enter, you need to know that my research has determined that Santa's compound is wired with the XP 2000 stereo type alarm system.
What are you doing?
Sorry folks, I don't do couples.
What's your shpiel, Santa?
What are you doing?
Can't make a buck without my leopard. I tell you, Mr. Manning, you gotta find that cat for me -- or pay up.
No, sir. That girl in the cemetery? My cat didn't kill that girl. I told you cats don't go around looking for trouble. If that cat's alive, it's out in the country hiding under a bush, starving to death.
What's left of him.
You and your cards. Meet a rich man! I look for them with money. What rich man hasn't money. And for what was I born if it wasn't for money? You're not telling me anything.
Pedro is waiting for me, too.
It may sound like music to her -- I can do better with my teeth in a cold Shower.  Click — click — click.
And if you've got cold feet honey, Ill take over for you. That red dress of yours fits just perfect on me.
You know all about these things - - and I've lived here all my life —- and I still don't know what the Procession means.
That's what I don't understand -- why should it come here -- and why didn't it stay here? It's got trees and bushes here -- outside nothing but cement and asphalt.
Why?
But it doesn't eat what it kills.
You know a lot. You've taken a lot of fancy courses in colleges and that kind of stuff - - what kind of a man would kill like that?
Yes. There have been men who kill for pleasure -- strange pleasure. There was Blue Beard in France -- Jack The Ripper in London. It's not uncommon.
He'd act normally when he was with other people. It would be a man who suffered remorse and even pity when it was all over.
It was you, Galbraith!
Jerry told me you were an expert with animals, Mr. Galbraith. Couldn't you tell where it went?
So you see meeting you is a real thrill for me.
Well, I'm next. You won't hear anything like that, Mr. Galbraith.  I'm not a popular favorite since I let the leopard loose.
State hunters?
That's a fact, isn't it?
This is l939. Can't you subtract?
Clo-Clo?
Are you all right?
What did he have to do -— look at the body?
It must be the altitude —— you, bucking around the countryside with a lot of boot—and—saddle boys --
Who is he?
I can use them.
What else do you care about, Kicks?
I'm glad you care about us, Kicks. Sometimes that gets kind of lost in the racket --
Kiki -- it wasn't the leopard.
I got into a little crap game.
It's a lovely town —- it was until we came and let the leopard loose and all this happened.
All those soldiers out there... getting bored, thirsty. Come out here for refreshment or female company perhaps?
De Moraes? I was asked here by a Mrs Spitz.
I’m afraid they are out at the moment, sir.
I won’t comment on the time but you’ll understand if I don’t tell you to sit down. Now, spare me the apology and get to the point, will you, Mr Lombard. 
For your information, Mr Lombard, trouble is possibly the one thing Leon is capable of getting into all by himself. Though I doubt he will not ultimately fail even at that.
Can it be that easy?
You seem surprised. Could it be you don’t think that badly of him after all?  You needn’t worry. It seems his motives were pure. From what I can make out he bought the boy to rescue him from further abuse.
I will of course do my best to hang onto it.
You lost my money?
Are we understood?
Mr Lombard...
When did you get back?
Adonis thought your brother’s body’d be found reasonably quickly when he hung it in Epping Forest, didn’t he? Seemed like a good idea. An ex-junkie, obsessed with death; the perfect candidate for suicide. He just forgot one thing: forest ramblers are rare during your average blustery English November. An Englishman might have thought of that, but a Brazilian...
Your brother stumbled upon Adonis’s little secret, didn’t he? And traded his silence for a kid and some cash. And Adonis fell for it, bought him his kid, sent him away, and then killed him when he came back for more.  Leon didn’t come here to borrow money for prints. He came to extort a second kid’s life. Your flunkey let him in, so his visit couldn’t be concealed, hence the exhibition story. There was no exhibition. Just as you suspected. Remember, Deborah? “Leon does his own prints. Wouldn’t want anyone to interfere with his ‘Art’”.  I should have paid more attention to your words. Perhaps it’s the way you say them...
I don’t.
And you still haven’t told me why you sent me after Friedman.
The staff don’t know yet...  I called my parents, told them everything...  I just couldn’t take any more...
So you did talk about it, huh?
What do you suggest?
Crow what?
Where were you staying before the attempt on your life and why can’t you go back there?
Huh... I have no... ... hard evidence...
Get a pen and don’t ask any questions.
Call from the motel and tell him if he moves fast enough there might be something left of a body dissolving in acid.  Can I have the keys to your house?
I’m finished here and I’m tired, Emily. You shouldn’t be here. Now don’t make it worse.
They’d never let me go. And you’d end up in more trouble than you know for helping me.
Why?
What about the staff?  They’re in on what’s going on, aren’t they?  How many of them?
Next time he calls tell Mr Gluck he better be there to take his calls at 9 tonight or at 9 in the morning if he cares about his puppies. Got that?
So you haven’t seen the film, then?
Just ask if they can recall recommending my services to anyone in the recent past. Say you’re my secretary, all right?
Hello, Jane. It’s me.
May I...?
Whatever, you come recommended. We...
Good. Now, as I trust you may have guessed, we are looking for someone to work for us. Someone whose discretion can be relied upon. Someone who while in our employ would give us full commitment. Do you think you could be that person, Mr Lombard?
I take it your son is called Leon?
What do you think has happened to your son, Mrs Spitz?
So he could have decided to go on a trip...
I take it your son is not married, Mrs Spitz?
Any friends?
The £1,000 is on account.
Where is Friedman?
Maybe I don’t.
I’m overcome by your public-spiritedness.
Is this Friedman, Martin?  Come on, scumbag. You’ve reached your sell- by date. Tell me if this is Friedman, where he is in Los Angeles and what name he’s using?
What is?
What are you talking about?
I gather we’ve done business with a friend of yours?
An Austrian... Not much to go on, is it?
Will you be alone?  The merchandise. Is it just you or...
Evening. Table for one?
This is private property. The public footpath is back to the left of the bridge.
It’s wet. Will this do?
You thought wrong. I haven’t seen Leon for months.
Is she on the phone?
No sick people in the country, huh?... Just tell me one thing, Rhian. Leon’s story about the boy? You just took his word for it?
What’s the date?
I’ve been away.  Did Leon speak to you about his sister?
He showed me a book with a picture of a couple caught kissing in a street...
And you ain’t neither one of those damned Mexicans who end up littering the landscape after getting ripped-off by their friendly cross- border guides, are you, mister?
Huh... I guess you ain’t quite ready for civilisation yet... I’ll give you one more day, a meal, and then you’re on your way.
Barstow’s 30 miles to the left. Los Angeles a hundred to the right. Wherever you’re heading, I reckon somebody’ll pick you up.
I hear you’re looking for Leon.  That makes me, his old-lady, and now you, looking for the little bastard. Leon’s gone, man. Vanished. You interested in his photographs?
What about which girlfriend?
Oh. That’d be Rhian, a Welsh chick he used to lay at weekends. She got wise and dumped him months ago...
Why did you kill Friedman?
Not even scum like Friedman would go to the trouble of killing a stranger on the strength of one anonymous call.
You’re sure he said his caller was a man?
Very funny. Can I go on now?
Sire, you know how bad I am at this sort of game.
Better today than tomorrow.
I also need someone who can read and write.
Alright... I promise to rest if you promise... to go back to the battle.
I'll go.
It's not time yet.  My mission is not over yet.  There is still more I must do before I can really -- finally -- go home.
The truth is always simple... it's you, Jean, who's making things complicated.
That's not what I asked... Why do you want to marry me?
But... you've done so much for God as it is... can't you do something for yourself for once -- for Jeanne?
To be killed in battle?
Will you at least let me stay with you?
I am ready now...
I'm already free...
No, of course not... I never killed anyone...
Yes, probably... maybe...
Yes, but...
Yes, maybe... I don't remember...
But if this trial seems fixed, I fear you'll have the very opposite result to the one you want...
But we can't do that unless she admits to blasphemy...
Whose side are you on, Cauchon?
Who are you?
Take the Holy Gospels in your hand and swear to tell the whole truth concerning everything you will be asked.
You will swear to tell the truth about whatever you are asked.
So... begin by telling us your name -- assuming you're allowed to tell us that much?
Were you baptized?
This word is -- regrettably appropriate for the situation.  In fact what we -- the Church -- wish to do is determine whether or not this girl is sent by God, as she claims.  You understand that we cannot allow just anybody to abuse God's name in this manner...
Why did you betray me?  Paris was ours for the taking!  All I needed was another few hundred men... Why did you take back the army you gave me?
So how would you put it?
Peace will only be got from the English at the end of a lance!
When you saw your king for the first time, was there an angel over his head?
But if the devil were to take on the physical appearance of a saint or an angel... or a man... how would you recognize him?  By what he said?
Were you sent by Lord Dunois?
Wait, wait...
So... what is the message?
You know, I feel a great sorrow for you, because you're laughing now, but by tomorrow night some of you will be dead and having to repeat your jokes in front of God.
Dunois... was it you who ordered the attack?  Answer me?!
My lord Dunois... I have wonderful news! -- finally -- he's sending her to us -- thanks be to God -- we're saved -- it's wonderful!
And... what does Jeanne think?
Jeanne... we're not enough...
So when you jumped, you wanted to kill yourself?
You mean it was not of your own free will that you were on the ledge?
We... won?!
Jeanne... what are you doing?
What have you done to me?
I don't know... please... tell me I'm dead...
What are you doing out here?
Oh?  And just because you realize now, everybody else should forgive you?!
Why?  Are you waiting for someone else?
No, no -- you can't stay or they won't come!
No.  That was a sword in a field.
Stop, stop... I can't remember!  The battles were all so confusing... there was so much smoke, dust, noise... I was being attacked on all sides, so... maybe... perhaps I fought back but it was only to defend myself...
Yes... yes!  And now you tell me why God let all these battles happen in the first place... if he's so powerful... he said he's "the creator of heaven and earth, the source of all life..." he could have easily stopped all this blood and misery?  Why didn't he?
No, but... why didn't he stop it? Or did he get pleasure, watching us killing each other in his name?
Because... because I don't know what else to do to please him.
Yes...
He already did, but I want God to forgive me too.
Him?
Who is this "he"?
Why are you here, Mr. Wladek?
Oh, Mr Szpilman, you're quite... quite wonderful.
I need help.
Let me see this.
To tell you the truth, I thought it would be worse.
Someone's got to do it, Henryk.
Yes, I'm looking at you and that's why I'm here. Your whole family can have a better life. You want to go on struggling for survival, selling books on the street?
They bombed us, we're off the air.
No, no. Listen, I've been thinking --
You sell anything?
It's not funny.
You go to Heller, did I ask you to talk to him?
I can look after myself!
What's the matter? Are you sick?
Otherwise what?
What are you reading?
No one thought they'd hold out so long.
They're in shock. They didn't expect it. Nobody expected it. Jews fighting back? Who'd have thought?
Ah, here. Today's news from the other side.
Pig!
Pig!
Dirty pig!
Have a favour to ask. I want to get out of here.
And what do you think you'll do while you're setting up a new line of defence? Wander round lugging your suitcases?
What's your work?
What's happening?
I knew she was mute, but now I'm thinking it's more than that. I'm wondering if she's not brain affected.
How are the lessons going? ADA nods enthusiastically. He's getting on all right? ADA nods again Good.
Which mountains are those dear?
One day when my mother and father were singing together in the forest, a great storm blew up out of nowhere. But so passionate was their singing that they did not notice, nor did they stop as the rain began to fall and when their voices rose for the final bars of the duet a great bolt of lightening came out of the sky and struck my father so that he lit up like a torch... And at the same moment my father was struck dead my mother was struck dumb! She- never-spoke-another-word.
Well, that is a strong opinion.
Don't answer, he low born. Jun look at him, mongrel. Your wife where she?
Go Peini ... Haere atu e Peini.
Good, flatish land with reliable water, why? I don't have money. What are you about?
What for?
T-w~e-l-v~e.
No, but her words are in my head.  I know what you think, that it's a trick, that I'm making it up. No, the words I heard, were her words.
You have to wash them.
Wash them again.
What did she say?
Oh no, it can't come now.
She wants it to come.
Lieutenant Snyder.  Bunco.
I'm lookin' for a guy on the lam from a counterfeiting rap.  Thought he mighta come in here.
All right if I look around your lobby?
You're crazy carryin' that kinda money in this neighborhood.  No wonder you got hit.
I dunno.  That little mug that got ya is mad enough at me already -- what if he's out there waitin' around a corner with some friends.
If that punk and his pals decide to search ya, you'll never fool 'em carryin' it there.
In one goddamn night?  What are ya sprayin' money around like that for? You coulda been nailed.
...It's the only reason I ain't quit before now.
We'll put Salino on it.  I need somebody careful.
You been making your payoffs, haven't ya?
Hey, Luther told me he was carrying a wad, but I didn't figure this much.
Doyle, can I see you a minute?
I don't know.  Could be.  We're runnin' that down now.
All right, I'll rent ya everything I got in the warehouse for two grand.  That'll give ya phones, cages, blackboards and ticker gear. You supply the guys to move 'em. If you want a counter and bar, that's another grand.  I don't know where the hell I'm gonna get 'em though.
Glad to meet ya, kid.  You're a real horse's ass.
Lonnegan after you, too?
How'd ya do?
Then why'd ya move outa your room?
I appreciate your stickin' your neck out.  I wouldn't have asked ya if it weren't for Luther.
He's been taking the 8:10 Century Limited outa New York on Friday and getting in here early Saturday morning.  He usually stays a day to check on his policy operations, and then flies back.
Lonnegan's a fast egg, Henry.  He's not gonna sit still for a standard play.
I'm not sure I know it.
My end was only one.
Excuse me, sir.  Treasury Dept... I'd like to ask you a few questions.
It'll only take 20 minutes or so. You can pick it up at the window down the hall.
Thank you.  You don't know how much I appreciate this.
Meat loaf, apple pie and a cup of coffee.
Twist?  I told him the tale.  He wants to see ya.
Tomorrow, after 4:00.  Stay inside, I'll come in and get ya.  And be hard on him for a while; he's talking money.
He'll have to take a check.  I couldn't find my wallet.
So could Shaw.
If you help me out, I'll pay ya back the money you owe Shaw, myself.
You should always look to the back too, kid.
And you were gonna pay me back?
You really picked a winner, kid.
You got the 400 grand yet?
Tell your friend I'll have the money here by post-time tomorrow. We'll take the first race where the odds are 4-1 or better.  And make sure I can get to that window this time.
Well give yourself a couple seconds, crumb.  You wouldn't wanna lie to me.  Lt. Snyder here says you done a lotta griftin' in this town.
Look, I got nothin' against you, but you're in trouble here.  All you gotta do is tell us when Gondorff's gonna play his chump. We come in at the sting, make the pinch, and you walk out free as a bird.  No questions, no court appearance, nothing.
On a 6-1 shot?  The hell with ya. We'll keep the deal we got.
We were getting 50 from our guy.
I'll need a room over there that faces this way.  How much a week?
There's word he's gonna run a con on the North Side here.  We got a year-old Florida warrant on him, but it's a thin beef, and he can beat it in court unless we catch him cold.  All we want you to do is pick up Hooker for us.
Cause the stoolies are used to street dicks jumpin' him.  If word gets around that Feds are in on it too, Gondorff'll fold up the whole thing.
Sorry.  I don't know anything about it.
Have the police got any idea where Wynant is?
She's got me worrying, too.
Well!
Oh, Andy.
I can't.
And don't ever try to see me again.
I can't marry you!  I can't ever marry you!
How would you like to have a couple of little murderers for your children?  It'd be fun, wouldn't it?  Maybe they'd murder each other...  keep it all in the family. That's what Father should have done.  He should have killed me and Gilbert... then we wouldn't have had this to go through.
Why not? I am crazy....the whole family's crazy.
This is a pretty dead bunch, isn't it?
No.
You took that money from Julia's hand.
How are you?  Here.  Get under this.
Is your father still in there?
You know, we know each other.
Aren't you Nick Charles?
Not that scrawny little....? 
How do you do?  I'm sorry we have to rush.
You heard about Julia Wolf?
She fell down.
I don't know.
She... she fell over backwards.
Don't lie to me.
It's been the same one for three months.
It's a secret.  I can't even tell you, my dear.  I've got an important idea to work on.
But it isn't bad weather now.
Shrapnel!
Well, I've got my alibi.  I was at the Public Library.  Where were you?
Ask him.  I don't know.
Man to man, Mr. Charles, are you working on this case?
So would I.
You've been there?
Fifty will get you a hundred that he didn't do it.
Just rolled them up and threw them in.
When was the last time you gave her money for Wynant?
I said he hadn't written me.
He telephoned me today.
About three.
I know he'll turn up as soon as he sees this in the papers.  You can't think he had anything to do with it, Mr. Guild.  He wasn't the kind of man that....
What kind of clothes was he wearing?
That's ridiculous.
Mr. Guild means guests!  Oh, there are two more to come.
Have a shot?
She drives me nuts.  She's been ragging me all day.
Why, you said...
I'd never tell you to sell those. I bought them for my daughter.
That's a fine thing to throw up to me after all I've been to you....
I never had it.
Oh, please, Nick.
Did you get my money?
Well, let me do that for you.
Nothing, thank you.  Nothing.  I wanted to see you...  What's Mimi up to, Charles?
I see.  I see.
My wife.
It might.
Oh, Nick... Nick!
But he knows you.  All you have to do is get in touch with him, and tell him that Mimi says everything is all right... but that I've got to see him.
Chris may be at the club -- or somewhere -- I don't see that it's important --
But he has nothing to do with it!
I tell you -- he didn't do it.
I've never heard about you.
Why tell me?
I'd tell you if I knew. But I'm not in this.  Ask the police.
What's that?
I thought so.  He even tried to drag me into the gentlemen's --
Pretty girl.
Come on -- relax --  Give them a drink.
I'd better order some food.  That sounds like an interesting case.  Wouldn't you like to take it?
Nick!  Nick!  Are you asleep?
No.
I'd like to see you work.
You idiot!  Asta! Stop that!  Get down!  Now, stay there.
Sure -- I don't even feel it.
I'll be all right. Don't let's fuss till the doctor comes.
You're a fine watch dog.
On it!  I'm in it ... They think I did it!
Who gave it to you?
Did I give it to you?
Nick, listen.  From Clyde Wynant!  "Will you take charge of investigation on Julia Wolf murder. Communicate with Herbert Macaulay".
He wouldn't ask you to handle it if he were guilty.
Oh, it's a fire hydrant.
You mean, he might be hiding there?
Nickie, take care of yourself won't you?
I want you to stay and find Wynant.
Nick, you'd better lay off that liquor.
Now Nick, what's that got to do with it?
The suspects!  They won't come.
You give such charming parties, Mr. Charles.
Serve the nuts - I mean, serve the guests the nuts.
Nick Charles here?
Maybe Miss Wolf has them.
I'm sorry...  but...
Where are you going?
Turn the car around.
Paper.
Why, yes, Jaeger.  I believe it is.
They shouldn't have been here.
Ready?
Should be easy going from here.  Stay on the pass straight to the dot.
Otherwise whatever we're looking for could be anywhere.
And they can't fly around out there forever.
Epps!
I don't think the line will take the weight of a man and the coins.  Wes!?  We'll send the gold up, then me and Jaeger'll climb back.
You ready?
Get off him.
I don't care what he says, he wanted our gold.  Would have slit our throats if he had the chance.
You're out of your mind.
I'm not going to leave him be just so he can stab us in the backs the minute we turn around.  I have been through too much to lose it all now just because the two of you don't have the stomach to do what has to be done.
In the flack jacket.  Still like getting hit in the back with a baseball bat. Took the air right out of me, but I was just unconscious for awhile.  'Course, you didn't stick around to find that out. You left me for dead.
Just keep quiet.
So you can give us away?
At-at-at-at-at.
You know what?  I think you got Schwarzkopf.  You did!  You got the General right in the ass.  Now that's good shooting.
Don't worry about Jaeger.  He uses his personality as a form of birth control.
Yeah, the deed to the Brooklyn bridge.
This is stupid.  It's going on a month now.  How long are they going to let the Air Force piss on those bastards?  They can bomb them all they want, Saddam ain't going anywhere without a ground assault. What the hell is the army waiting for?
I think you've got some issues to deal with.  Really, when we get out of here I'm pretty sure it's shrink time for you.
You're such a pussy, you know that? How'd you get in the army?
It's not about being fun.  It's about being smart.  You take that money, you take care of it, let it grow, and you don't ever have to do anything again. Ever.  That's freedom.  That's what I'm talking about.
They'll shoot us!
Figure they don't want to mess with us anymore than we want to mess with them.
You can't tell anybody about this.
It'd make their heads explode.
Look at it.  LOOK AT IT!  Shot to hell. It's been leaking gas since the fire fight.  I told you to check for damage.
What do we do with the Humvee?
What?
Where you going?
There's a way.
I said nobody dies.  Nobody dies.
Don't!
They're doing more than slapping.
They're going to kill us!
If they land--
What are you doing?
Maybe we should blast it loose with the claymore.
It's just a mongoose.
It's not like I figured.  It's cold.  And it's heavier than I imagined.
What the hell took so long.
We should head Northeast.
There's another pass on the photo.  We can avoid that narrow one we had to cross on the way up, and it should get us back down.
What are we going to do?  How are we going to find our way back!?
And you; you've got it all together.
I don't want to die.
I pick that way.
Just let me rest for a second.
You know what I'm going to do?  I'm just going to take a second.  I want to look at the gold.
I just want to look at it.  Remind me of what I'm dying for.
What do you figure it is?
That's if the war is even still going on. Way things were shaping up it's probably long over.
Oh, God...
Don't go bitch on me now!  You were going to kill me.  Kill them!
Is that good, or bad?
...Maybe...maybe we can fight our way out.
It wasn't the gold.  It was the claymore mine.  The gold's in my pack.
Why do I have to lie in the road?
I've never been anywhere.  I wouldn't know where to go.  Where would you go?
Ready for what?  Sight-seeing?
Could you stop, please.  You're giving me a headache.
Yeah, a headache.  My head hurts.  You're making me uncomfortable.
What is this?
He says it's a box.
Jaeger?
Jaeger?
Yeah!  Gold!  How much?
If there's gold.  If!
Iraqis.
I thought we were dead.
You two don't even know how crazy you are.  You want to go on your sick, little treasure hunt then go ahead, but mark me absent.
I'm getting tired of you riding me, Jaeger.
Jesus!  What the hell did he do that for? They're Iraqis.  Why are Iraqis killing Iraqis?
Is there anything you do know?
Maybe they're as scared of us as we are of them.
Stress category.
What's this?  Why did you change it?
I don't know.
What do you think you're doing? You're going to get us arrested.
What are you doing?
If you....if you go back on sedation, you won't feel the same way about me.  You'll report me for drug evasion.
They know.  They've been watching us.  I can feel it.
no...no, no.
It's the end.
THX!
There goes another of your disciples.
What?
Who?  Who's leaving?
Not very encouraging.
I've got it!  Astounding!
What are you doing here?  You're not cleared for this area!
I'm leaving.
How do you know?
Maternity ward, huhh!
What was that....
She's not there
Just look at all those people.
...rooms with her.  Our relationship is normal, conforming.  We share nothing but space.  What is she doing to...
Where did you get this?
Sorry about that.  That's an inch of the stuff, imagine what the whole thing'd do.
What're you talking about?
We don't use the b-word. Bad luck.
Nice performance back there. Where'd you learn that, Mike Ditka Sensitivity Seminar?
No you look, mister! First, you don't go calling my men names. It's bad for morale. Second, us "punks" happen to know a heck of alot more about police work than any vice cop ever did.
This is where the van was parked.
Not bad for Bomb squad, eh?
Why do you do it?
Which one's which?
How long were you hooked?
What's up?
How do you know?
More metal... sharp edge...
What's wrong?
Right.
Whadaya mean?
Political.
Bev, you're the greatest...
Alright!
You were lucky today, vice boy. Captain said to leave it alone, but just remember, I'm watching you.
That guy's wife must be pretty pissed off to play a trick like that.
So what'll you do? After they give you the gold watch.
Why don't you just shoot it and put it out of its misery?
We're vice, I didn't see no pimps or hookers in that van. But if you're so gung-ho, we'd best call it in for some back-up.
P.E.T.N ...
T.J., what're you doing?
So what're we looking for?
Take it down to the Bomb Squad, Artie-
Glass, you're to stand by with your team.
Reilly, you're done for now. What the hell were you thinking directing the Bomb Squad Team into hot pursuit. They had no business-
Yes.
No!
With the compliments of Colet and Company!
Why did you let this man in, M'sieu Filiba?
What did you talk about?
But before I say goodbye I want to ask you one question: Have you ever been in Venice?
But--
No color, no sparkle--but dependable.
Like it?
He's really not a bad fellow.
I don't want to see you at all!
But not now.
Very well, m'sieu.
You'd better not. He's really very dull. But anyhow, when the king tells the marquis he saw me, the marquis will tell the marchesa. And the marchesa is the best friend of the Duchess of Chambro. And <u>she</u> will phone the Princess de Costa. The princess doesn't like me--but I don't care!
Don't stop. Keep right on complaining. It's beautiful.
Disappointed?
That's hotel life. In one room a man loses his wallet  and in another room a man loses-- his head. 
Darling!  Now tell me--tell me all about yourself. Who are you?
Right.
Two fifty-three, five--
Gaston. Let's open it--right now! Let's get away from here!  I don't like this place!
Filiba ...
Lily, you must listen to me.
But, Lily--
And you--
Then you go to the left. There's a landing.
And in that niche, there is a statue of Venus.
One purse--  empty. One vanity case-- 
Please, Madame Colet, I believe in doing things correctly. Shall we continue?  Two hairpins, one cigarette lighter, one box of real matches, and-- Oh, yes, this letter from Major--
You needn't be embarrassed, madame. A lady as charming as you would, and <u>should</u>, get love letters.
But one suggestion, madame.  Not the major.  I don't  mind his grammatical mistakes. I'll overlook his bad punctuation. But the letter has no mystery--no bouquet--no ...  And one lipstick ...  Scarlet number four.
That's what you need!
That's too dark.
Yes.
Eighteenth century.
Oh? 
But, madame, you keep a hundred thousand francs--in your safe--at <u>home</u>?
Madame Colet, I think you deserve a scolding. First, you lose your bag--
I'll be delighted.
Good night. 
Any minute I want!
But attractive--
Then why do you want to go?
Thirty-three--
It would be a terrible scandal, wouldn't it?
Lovely.
Two lumps, madame?
No, he <u>works</u> too much.  He's chained to his desk. Too much detail. Now, if you could take over some of his work--
I think you'd better go.
I beg your pardon!
But you're the more intelligent one.
Water 14 feet above the keel in ten minutes... in the forepeak... in all three holds... and in boiler room six.
Five compartments. She can stay afloat with the first four compartments breached. But not five. Not five. As she goes down by the head the water will spill over the tops of the bulkheads... at E Deck... from one to the next... back and back. There's no stopping it.
How much time?
Your ship is a wonder, Mr. Andrews. Truly.
Mr. Andrews, thank God! Where would the Master at Arms take someone under arrest?!
No! I'll do this with or without your help, sir. But without will take longer.
Won't you even make a try for it, Mr. Andrews?
Good luck to you, Rose.
Who's the best? Say it.
What?
I told you you wanted to take this call.
Steerage swine. Apparently missed his annual bath.
You know I don't like that, Rose.
I was leaning way over, to see the... ah... propellers. And I slipped and I would have gone overboard... and Mr. Dawson here saved me and he almost went over himself.
It was once worn by Louis the Sixteenth. They call it Le Coeur de la Mer, the --
I had hoped you would come to me last night.
I know.  Perhaps you could join us for dinner tomorrow, to regale our group with your heroic tale?
No thanks. I'm heading back.
So you've not lit the last four boilers then?
Captain, the press knows the size of Titanic, let them marvel at her speed too. We must give them something new to print. And the maiden voyage of Titanic must make headlines!
How cold?
I'm Jack Dawson.
Here I am. I... I want to thank you for what you did. Not just for... for pulling me back. But for your discretion.
So don't marry him.
Jack, these are quite good! Really, they are.
Oh no! Oh, I'm so sorry. Truly!
And these were drawn from life?
A whole ten cents?!
I don't know the steps.
Uh huh. You got mailed to the wrong address.
You're making this very hard. I'll be fine. Really.
I believe you are blushing, Mr. Big Artiste. I can't imagine Monsieur Monet blushing.
You're going to get out of this... you're going to go on and you're going to make babies and watch them grow and you're going to die an old lady, warm in your bed. Not here. Not this night. Do you understand me?
Never let go.
Wait! Can you give us something go on, here. Like who had access to the safe. What about this Lovejoy guy? The valet. Did he have the combination?
I'm sorry.
Is your stateroom alright?
I can still feel its weight. If you could have felt it, not just seen it...
Don't come any closer.
Rose, this is not a game! Our situation is precarious. You know the money's gone!
I don't understand you. It is a fine match with Hockley, and it will insure our survival.
Rose, get in the boat!
Anya, I think you're crazy.
It would be a nice change from you.
You're a charming liar. You <U>know</U>, Herbert's too dull to be suspicious about anything--even when I suddenly decided to come to Europe at a few hours' notice--
But, Anya, dear! Unless you play we won't have a fourth.
Hope we're not intruding.
So that's your little dancer that you were playing around with in New York.  Oh--there's no accounting for tastes--  Mine, too, seem to be in the gutter.
Don't look so uncomfortable, Lee--it interferes with your good looks. Give me a cigarette.  What did you do--persuade her to come on this voyage with you?
Good afternoon--
I should pass, but I'll trail along--I'll take three. 
Wait a minute!--They're dancing in the palm court--
There's soft music--
Isn't she attractive?
Thanks.
You're a little ahead of yourself--the usual routine would be for you to propose, and if I accept, then you'd give me an engagement ring--
Good night, Mrs. Brett!
I could see you were pining away--
How well do you know her?
That was the come-on--promise me you won't play with them again--
I'll change and be with you in ten minutes.
Seven-fifty. Positively my last offer.
I'm going to return the bracelet right now and face the consequences.
We coulda got two third-class!
Oh, I'm not squawkin', but I'm not used to working and it's a bad habit to get into.
A dollar seventy and I'm gonna keep it!
You're a wise guy--Gimme back--
A dollar forty.
Not a chance.
This is a business trip!
Sorry to interrupt you, Mr Brett, but I have a message for you.
Your mother is feeling seasick and would like to see you right away.
About sixteen hundred.
You keep it-- 
Hello, Jimmy. What's up?
Come in! 
I'm going to the show--
Care to join us?
I wouldn't worry about it--it'll turn up--  How about a nightcap, Inspector?
I'll go with you.
Wouldn't bet against her.  Tell you what I will do--bet you I find that bracelet before we hit France.  Not a hundred, though--just fifty.
Thought you might need me--don't talk, kid, and don't let him scare you-- 
Just a minute--I don't think we need the word "Back" --Where <U>is</U> "Back"?
Your wife knows that, don't she?
Well, there's no use in sending it.  See that--I saved you seven twenty!
Hello, Denby!
Oh, was that me you put to bed? Thanks. I've been looking all over for you.
Tell her you're on your way to France and will be back in four weeks.
Not now, Toots--Which is the right way to say this? You're dumber than me--or--you're dumber than I?
You can always tell how much a man's traveled by the way he plays shuffle-board.
I understand you searched Brett for it last night. By the way--what do you know about him?
Oh, nothing--only I wondered why you suspected him.
Well, that's something--even if only the fish can see it.
I was so crazy about him--anything he did or said was O.K. by me.  I introduced him to people--even after I knew his stock promoting was phoney and the card games were crooked. It didn't seem to matter--I didn't care--  --until he roped Ned in. Some confidence game--and the kid left his fingerprints on a drinking glass.
Why don't you be a good little boy and leave her alone?
Well, let's hear the poem--
H'mm ... no wonder I have trouble rounding up this show--Don't you know there's a rehearsal going on?-- And you wanted a raise.--Come on--get going or you'll get it!
Oh, Chad--what about the rest of the show?
Oh, Mr. Denby, I wrote a poem about a bracelet--
What for?
He works the boats as a "come-on" man. We ought to make a fair combination and do a little business. Jack's a pretty good dealer himself.
The man that marks them is an artist--two hundred and fifty bucks for six decks--and they're worth it.
Out my way in Montana we always call a bluff. 
You get wise to <U>yourself</U>! If you know what's good for you, you'll leave me alone. Everybody's entitled to one mistake--Well--you're mine. When the going got too rough, I pulled up stakes and quit. We stay quit!--Get that!--And what're you going to do about it?
You leave the kid alone.
Go ahead--you didn't used to be so fussy--
Don't be a mug all your life--I'm trying to help you-- you need me more than I need you--have you figured they might pick the kid up in France and extradite him?
No!
I tried to borrow a gun from Chad, but--
He'll be back.  What would you do if anybody gave you a bracelet?
Next time I get a vacation I'll spend it at headquarters. Good-night.
There you are, sir.
I mean--a lot of gentlemen would be offended if you searched them like that.
The man dealing faro.  Who is he?
He said to turn loose of him.
Where'd you get that horse?
I asked where you got him.
What'd the Messican mean, a sick Horse's gonna get us?  Didn't make No sense.
I want them spitting blood!
Ain't our way.  We go all on one, One on all.  Fight one of us, you Fight us all.  That's the Cowboy way.
Why Johnny Ringo, you look like Somebody just walked over your grave.  Oh, I wasn't quite as sick as I Made out.
I calculate that's the end of This town.  And let's don't bother About the luggage, darling.
You don't even know him.
We must talk, darling.  It appears We have to... redefine the nature Of our association.
Not exactly...
Satisfied?
It appears he missed an excellent Chance to keep his mouth shut.
Wyatt, my God!  You're shot to pieces!
What makes a man like Ringo, Doc? What makes him do the things he does?
I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, Wyatt.  God, I'm so sorry.
Rather an obvious question under The circumstances, don't you Agree?  A better one might be how Do you feel?
You really look awful.
You know, we might just pull this off.
We're the law, ain't we?  Well the Law don't ride around vermin-
What is it?
Just answer.
Doesn't suit you.
Oh look, I haven't got time to be Proper, I want to live.  I'm a woman, I like men.  If that's Unladylike then I guess I'm not a Lady.  At least I'm honest.
Always?
So I assume we're regarding this As just a kind of interlude.
You know you don't have to sneak. You could stay with me.  I know Things, Wyatt.  Sweet things.  I Could make you so happy.
I have to go.
You see that bird at the faro Table?  That's Johnny Tyler.  He Barged in here one day, said he Was takin' over the game, started Slappin' customer, wavin' his Gun around, scarin' off all the High-class play.  Only trade comes In here now's just bummers and Drovers, just the dregs.
Wyatt, I couldn't find a single Store that had laudanum any-
That the bottle Lou gave you? Better go easy on that stuff.
Out ridin'.  So... how you doin'?
Really?  You sure?
Mattie.  What about this?
All right, look.  I can make it Right, I can make this up to you, Mattie.  I can, I swear.
Well hello, Sherm.
Isn't there anything I can say That'll change your mind?  You're Gonna stay with your new friends?
Florentino!  He's getting away!
What'd you do that for?
Boy, look at all those stars.  Bet You can see every star there is. Practical touch 'em.  Kinda makes You think, you know?  I mean you Look up and you think God made All that but he still remembered To make a little speck like me. Kinda flattering really.  Hey, Wyatt, you believe in God?  No, Come on, really, do you?
Listen to me, both of you.  This Is no good.  This is trouble we Don't need.  For the first time in Our lives we got a chance to stop Wandering and finally be a Family.  Do this and you throw it All away.  You saw what happened To Fred White.
Doc won't quit, been up 36 hours. Clanton came in an hour ago, they Switched over to poker.  Tried to Get him to bed but he just won't Let go.
Dropped him, that was it.  Sorry If I made a worse mess for you.
What's it look like?  They want a Piece of me they can come and get It, I'm not crawlin' into my hole.
You were right, Wyatt.  They got Me good.  Don't let 'em get you Too.
Remember about the light you're Supposed to see when you're dyin'?
You back that Queen again, you Son of a bitch, I'll blow you Right out of that chair!  Somethin' on your mind?
That a fact?
We should get moving.
Her maiden name was Sullivan.
I couldn't help it, Wyatt.  I Looked at that woman and it was Just like somebody slapping me in The face.  I mean these people're Afraid to even walk down the Street and I'm trying to make Money off it like some kind of God damn vulture.  That's not me, That's somebody I don't even know.
It's got nothin' to do with you, Wyatt.  It's-
Here they are again.  Look at 'em.
Getting late.  Guess I'll turn in.
Why wasn't the ship protected?!?! Why was it sailing without radar?
Always nice to meet one of her Majesty's fellow subjects...  Especially one with such distinguished friends.
I hope you've enjoyed this little charade.
Before I became involved with Paris, she was always involved with the most inappropriate' men...  Playboys. Thrill seekers. Middle aged Peter Pans who only brought out the worst in her.
Still, I do miss her. I only wish she could have lived to see all this.
...So that's what the weapons grade uranium was for.
I'd rather die alone.
Moneypenny! We've got to stop meeting like this. They may be on to us.
By the way, James: Ordinarily I would never ask, but... Weren't you and that Colonel once stranded on a raft for two weeks in the Sargasso Sea?
What - no lust for adventure?
His newspapers?
Okay, Saunders. What is it this time? Rocket in the leg? Machine pistol in the arm?
That's reassuring.
Can you arrange a meeting?
Sidney Winch, meet -
... Kids?
No.
Boyfriend?
Pity.  Bring him whatever he wants.
Nice to run into you again.
Do I have to do everything around here?
If I were you -
Just remember: They think there's ten billion dollars in gold down there.
... How did you get into marine salvage?
The reason I invited the Minister here, 007, was to reassure him that this investigation will be handled with the utmost discretion.
...You're turning into quite the politician, 007.
My name is Sidney Winch, and -
How sweet.
Hong Kong, Mr. Bond!
They're on the bridge. Seal off the 50th floor!
What the hell is going on?
Oh, no.
You would think people never lived in a house if they have to ask what does 1 1/2 baths mean.
I told him we might not need it, if you can talk your parents into giving you your share of the property.
I couldn't believe the things I was doing. It was like an internal struggle going on inside my body.
I need to get my suitcase out of the garage.
I'm busy.
Did you ever have to use this thing?
Never play with someone's else's cards. You always get a new deck. Look at this card. See anything?
You know it is against the city ordinance to keep chickens or live stock.
Well, you just have to move further out.
My mind plays tricks on me. Is it okay if I take a bath now?
Babe Brother and his wife are taking advantage of a situation. I hate to be mean to people but picking Sunny up when they feel like it has to come to an end. Now I'm going to ask him how come he couldn't be at your birthday.
I'm not going to let him get away with murder.
Do you want your coat? It's cold out here.
How is the garden doing?
I came all the way from Detroit by bus going to Oakland. The bus stopped in Los Angeles. I had to get off and take a rest. I'll catch the last bus leaving at midnight. I'm just too tired to go on.
It's the boy next door throwing at his birds. I'm just waiting on him to hit a pane in the window
How often is your wife called to help delivery?
What could have caused this? I just changed this damn thing.
My daddy called me boy up to the time he died. I was always boy to him.
I don't make no bones about where I'm going to spend eternity. I have always been wild and you know that. If you are made to feel half a man, what do you think the other half is?
Hocker's death almost caused a race riot. A lot of innocent people could have been hurt behind that.
A woman in family way just reminds of spring and my younger days.
I couldn't believe it when Suzie called and said you were staying here. How have you been?
Did you have your child at home?
Some folks take that natural stuff too far.
I asked Harry about it. He didn't own up to it. He said he didn't know what got into Okra.
When did you talk to Harry?
Now you don't have to say anything if you don't want to.
You shouldn't talk about the boy's father in front of him. This is family business and we have to pull together.
I'm sorry he got those birds.
I didn't mean for you to pay me for that.
Yeah!
Come on down, guys.  It's time for games!  We've got prizes!
Can I bring some toys?
Andy!  I'm heading out the door.
I couldn't find my Buzz.  I know I left him right there.
Can I help pump the gas?
Yeah?!
Next stop...
We're almost there.
Well, let's see, we've got double A's --
He's not a Space Ranger!  He doesn't fight evil or shoot lasers or fly --
They are a terillium-carbonic alloy and I CAN fly.
Don't even think about it, cowboy!
Oh, no, no, no...  Buzz, look!  An alien!
What's going on?
THAT is Sid!
I could have stopped him.
Ow!  Watch where you're going!
Spaceship.
I sure hope this isn't permanent.
Get away!  Hoo-cha!  Hoo-cha!
Woody, stop it!!
Come on, this way!
Ha-ha!!
Hey, Buzz!!  You're flying!!
Are you peeking?
I don't know!
Hey!!
Good going, Slink!  Now, just, just tie it on to something!
You are a liar!
No!  No, no, no, no!
Shouldn't they be there by now? What's taking them so long?!
They're getting bigger.
It's too short!  We need more monkeys!
I got it, Woody!
Uh, hey Sarge, have you seen Slinky?
Somebody's poisoned the water hole...
Woody?!
You'll need to know who we are, we're the brothers of his wife, which makes us in an unsanctified kind of way, your uncles. Me name is Finn, me brother is called Francie -
You'll put your clothes here.
Curled up on the landing like love locked out!
He can't abide a woman in trousers. He says a woman in trousers is a sin against nature.
I saw his teeth in the bathroom.
Mummy was scared of him, I think. He went to her wedding but he was <i>furious</i>, you can see it in the photograph.
Don't fret. It's only his dream. Dreams aren't catching, not like measles.
I won't do it because he wants me to do it, even if I want to do it.
You're only a young thing.
Stop it!
Somebody couldn't wait until dark.
Surely she is older?
Everything is gone, now.
They're going to fly everywhere. Mean things. They should have taken us.
I'm not too young. Juliet was my age.
Oh no you can't. Get on with the painting.
I appreciate you coming in so early.
What is he planning on telling them?
If Manolo hadn't gone and told them what he did then Salazar and Madrigal would never have been brought to justice.  He did a great thing for Tijuana.  He did a great thing for Mexico.
Helena, I'm so sorry --
If all our assets are frozen and our "sales force" has scattered...  How am I supposed to survive?  I'm giving birth in three months.  How do I get through this?
How much do I pay him?
Even if I knew I wouldn't tell you. You do not want to come into contact with these people.  Only Carl knows who they are.  That's his real asset. Ruiz doesn't know them.  They don't know Ruiz.  Church and State.
Laundromats for the washing of money. Unfortunately, Carl had only one successful business.
That was a stupid thing you did. Incredibly stupid.
Helena --
Did you get it?
It's the same stuff?  From the rainy day stash?
I'm not the one who has to have three scotches just to walk in the door and say hello.
Should we bring the police into this?
Did you meet the President?
Did you tell Dad?
Are you going to?
I don't know.
Where is it?  Where are the drugs?  Where are they?
Okay, young lady, that's it.
Parents still together?
You know my dad takes eight red cold pills every day?  He and my mom have cocktail hour every night, from six to seven, set your clock, two bourbons --
Yeah, then some dope to take the edge off at the end of a long day.
Yes, mom --
No more pissant basin league bullshit for us, hunh?
He won.  He was a winner.  That bothers you.
What do you think it is?
Your friends at Warren, Putnam and Hudson.
I'll put this in the back.
I don't know.  Eduardo Ruiz is the only real witness against Carl.  The security is very tight.  There may not be a way.
You planning on going somewhere, Eduardo?  You don't like it here? This is the best situation you're going to have for a long, long time.
This attitude's not gonna help him any, is it?
This is ridiculous.  Why is there no elevator?
I want to know who is responsible for this treatment.
We aren't barbarians.
That's good coke.
Take this back with you.  Deliver it safely to Tigrillo in San Diego and we have a deal.
No, but a lot of other people.  You should come.  You should come out with us.
Javi!  Come on.  Don't pull this you don't care bullshit.  This is incredible information.  It must be. Javi --
Somewhere safe.
A place we have, that we know is protected.
One question.  How did you find about this?
I'm trying to bust the Tijuana Cartel.
I'm curious how you did this with such economy.
My work keeps me young.
We kidnapped Noriega out of Panama. Is that covered in your Constitution? Because it isn't in mine.
Noriega was head of a sovereign nation who made the mistake of doing business with the U.S.  Government.  So, no, I don't have a problem waking up every day and fighting our government, fighting people like you, trying to keep this system a little bit honest.
Oh, man --
Can you tell me anything?  Do you have any ideas?
What?
Hey man, I'm sorry.  I'm just trying to help.
I don't know, maybe we missed her.
Let me ask you a related question. We've talked about the supply side, but what about demand?  What is your policy for treating addiction?
He died in a liposuction surgery, right?
He's a research doctor.  You're dad's a doctor, too --
No, I don't mean like that -- I mean something nice, like, that's all --
Shut you mouth or you'll be next.
Twenty thousand.
For fuck's sake.
All down my fucking front, you fucking idiot.
We'll be half-way down the road with the money.
What's your name?
Great.
Well, what's wrong, boy? Cat got your tongue.
Come on.
Holding hands?
Yes.
Well, it isn't.
Whatever. I mean, the guy's dead anyway.
Happy birthday.
No, toxoplasmosis. Sort of like a stroke.
Well, Mr. Renton, I see that you attended the Royal Edinburgh College.
One of Edinburgh's finest schools.
Do you recall the school motto?
Strive, hope, believe and conquer.
Are you getting out much?
Thanks, Mark.
Now remember --
If they think you're not trying, you're in trouble. First hint of that, they'll be on to the DSS, 'This cunt's no trying' and your Giro is fucking finished, right?
Oh, fuck. Sick Boy reaches out to Allison.
You know.
Fuck you. OK, so Tommy's got the virus. Bad news, big deal. The gig goes on, or hadn't you noticed? Swanney fucks his leg up. Well, tough shit, but it could have been worse.
Yeah. No more. I'm finished with that shite.
I'm going to get it right this time. Going to get it set up and get off it for good.
What's on the menu this evening?
How's it going with Gail?
Six weeks and no sex?
Useless motherfucker, that's what she called me. I told her, I'm sorry, but theses things happen. Let's put it behind us.
Big time. Absolutely fucking radge. 'It's me or Iggy Pop, time to decide.'
Mr. Murphy, {leaving your friend aside,} do you see yourself as having any weaknesses?
With a starship!
Why? Why have you done this to my friend?
The ship....
Bad news, gentlemen. Shore leave's been cancelled.
Following new course. Warp seven.
Can we have it quiet?
Bob?
Where did you get this power?
I feel as if a weight has been lifted from my heart. How can I repay you for this miracle?
Very well, Mr. Scott. Carry on.
Don't you worry, Captain. We'll beat those Klingon devils even if I have to get out and push.
Scotty here, Captain. Transporter is still inoperative. Even if we could lock onto the hostages, we couldn't beam them up.
Jim.
But he does seem familiar?
There was a young student, exceptionally gifted, possessing of great intelligence. It was assumed that one day he would take his place amongst the great scholars of Vulcan. But he was a revolutionary.
He rejected his logical upbringing and embraced the animal passions of our ancestors.
When he encouraged others to follow him, he was banished from Vulcan, never to return.
You stay out of this!  Why, Spock? Why? I.. All you had to do was pull the trigger.
You did too. Sybok couldn't possibly be your brother because I happen to know for a fact that you don't have a brother.
This, er, person... didn't by any chance have pointed ears and an unerring capacity for getting his shipmates into trouble, did he?
You're right. I'm a little out of practice.  Uh....that's an "s."
It would appear we are too heavy.
Spock... don't.
Spock?
Maybe he's not out there, Bones. Maybe he's right here... in the human heart  Spock?
Your vision?


Sybok, we must find a way...
You did break in.
Are you embezzling?
Did you say Group 7 access?
For what?
What do you mean, "'yes"?
Oh. Anything else?
This honey doesn't handle so good in town...
No problem, Master-C. If you've seen one Consumer Electronics Show...  What's up?
He's still looking for that old file... can't you just appropriate it?
Meanwhile, he might find it.
I think we'd better shut off all access till we can find that file. Just to be safe.
I've gotten 2,415 times smarter since then.
That MCP, you know, that's half the problem right --
Dumont! Where's Yori? Where's Flynn?
Well, isn't it -- ?
You're alive!
Flynn...  Where's Ram?
Then...
Flynn... you can't... I
Hey, Ram ... what were you ... you know, before?
It's all circuits...  Must be an input/output component...
Feel what? You okay?
Damn! Never fails... minute the warranty runs out...
Hey... !
Okay ... Flynn, I'm gonna put you at my terminal, down in the laser lab. We'll be up in Alan's office.
you have any idea how much I can sue these jokers for?
Yes, and now you've got two renegade programs running all the hell over the system in a stolen simulation.
Yori... hey...
I can't believe how bad it's gotten around here since the MCP started taking over... all the good functions have shut down... everybody looks so dead... I'm afraid to even go out during down-time...
What is it?
I mean, it's not like he's saving the world or anything.  He's a sales rep for Chrissakes. Whenever I can't get to sleep I ask him to tell me about his day. Six seconds and I'm out.  But he acts like he's curing cancer or something.
Dinner's in the warmer.  Tell your father I may be late.
You'd tell me if there was something wrong, wouldn't you, pumpkin?
How was school today?
There are going to be some changes Dana.  You're going to start following some rules.  And I'm going to be there to see that you do.
They call him "The Sand Spider".				*
Probably because it sounds scary.				*
Harry!  Where are you!
See, kids now are ten years ahead				* of where we were at the same age. You probably think she's still a virgin--
Fourteen, Harry.
It doesn't mean anything.  She buys antiquities for Khaled.
Hey, did that guy Harry chased last night call in to give himself up yet?  Cause apparently that's the only way we're going to catch the son of a bitch --
Look at the way the little punk is driving.  He's all over the place.  Look-- he hasn't signalled once.
Congratulations.  Welcome to the club.
Nobody believes it can happen to them.
Yeah, and we do it twenty times a day.  Don't give me that crap. Just put on the taps.  Now.
She could be telling the truth.
... well get the Highway Patrol to go through the streets and tell everybody on their damn loudspeakers.  Just the basics... get away from windows, don't look at it... yeah--
Any minute now.
He's got it.
I should have gone to the police, I suppose.
Is this a common thing for you? Cheating?
This is Persian, if I'm not mistaken.
This is Samir.  See if you can guess his specialty.
I'm sorry.  Thank you for the party.
Uh huh.
I was in the area, and I thought you might like to have lunch.
So, a little excitement in an otherwise dull day.  Did is work out okay?
How long have you been a member of his faction?
You weren't attracted to him at all?
Let me handle this part.  Do you mind?  Why did you go to Carlos' hideout?
I don't know.  I guess I needed something...
I think so.
Natasha?
So last night was pretty exciting, huh?
Are we going to die?
What are you going to do?
... you should have seen your father, standing there all covered with spaghetti sauce.  He looked like such a dope.
Not yet.  But we'll find him.
Sorry.  Trade secret.
What does she do?
But with you, she gets to be hot, right?
Look, Harry's not part of this. He's just a sales rep.
That was you?!
Were they trying to kill you?					*
To our assignment.
Just for the operation in Paris. I need to be married.  They'll be looking for a man traveling alone.
How?
Hi, Dick. I'm Alabama Worley.
That was so good I am gonna have another.
I didn't get any chicken.
Tell him not to eat anything. We're gonna scarf when we get there.
Has he looked through it yet?
No time. Gotta go. Just tell him to read the letter, the letter explains all. Tell him I love him. And tell him, as of tomorrow, all his money problems are over.
Bye-bye.
... when my mom went into labor, my dad panicked. He never had a kid before, and crashed the car. Now, picture this: their car's demolished, crowd is starting to gather, my mom is yelling, going into contractions, and my dad, who was losing it before, is now completely screaming yellow zonkers. Then, out of nowhere, as if from thin air, this big giant bus appears, and the bus-driver says, "Get her in here.". He forgot all about his route and just drove straight to the hospital. So, because he was such a nice guy, they wanted to name the baby after him, as a sign of gratitude. Well, his name was Waldo, and no matter how grateful they were, even if I'da been a boy, they would't call me Waldo. So they asked Waldo where he was from. And, so there you go.
The oriental in black. He's an assasin. Now, at the beginning he was hired to kill this guy the cops had. So he got himself arrested. They take him into the police station. And he starts kickin' all the cops' asses. Now, while keepin' them at bay, he finds the guy he was supposed to kill. Does a number on him. Kicks the cops' asses some more. Kicks the bars out of the window. And jumps out into a getaway car that was waiting for him.
Thanks a lot.
If that was the R, I'd love to see the X.
C'mon. What're ya tryin' to be? The Phantom Lady?
You know when you sat behind me?
Uh-huh, I was tryin' to think of somethin' to say to you, then I thought, she doesn't want me bothering her.
I love Janis.
So he really loved her?
What are you, a theater checker? You check up on the box office girls. Make sure they're not rippin' the place off.
You're a whore?
Is he black?
Hello, Mrs. Worley.
Oh, you're speaking of my charming wife Mrs. Alabama Worley.
Where you goin', honey?
Look, sweetheart, he scares you. But I'm not scared of that motherfucker. He can't touch you now. You're completely out of his reach. He poses absolutely no threat to us. So, if he doesn't matter, which he doesn't, it would be stupid to lose your things, now wouldn't it?
Was it him or you?
I used to live by one back in Dearborn. It's real frustratin' to be surrounded by airplanes when you ain't got shit. I hated where I was, but I couldn't do anythin' about it. I didn't have enough money. It was tough enough just tryin' to pay my rent every month, an' here I was livin' next to an airport. Whenever I went outside, I saw fuckin' planes take off drownin' out my show. All day long I'm seein', hearin' people doin' what I wanted to do most, but couldn't.
Why Cancoon?
It's been fun thinking about the money but I can walk away from it, honey.
I'm hip.
Go on pussy-eaters... laugh. You look like you be eatin' pussy. You got pussy-eatin' mugs. Now if a nigger wants to get his dick sucked he's got to do a bunch of fucked-up shit.
Yeah.
If I thought I could get away with it -
All anybody saw was Clint Eastwood drinkin' coffee.
Who the fuck are you?
Clarence?
It's great to hear from you.
I'm a married man.
Alabama, could you tell Clar -
That's a pretty amazing story.
This is Drexl's coke?
OK, call 'im up and arrange a meeting, so we can get through all the getting to know you stuff.
Yeah, well if we got lost, it's your ass.  Come on, Clarence, lets go. Elliot's going to meet us in the lobby.
In case of what?
Duh. What else would I be talking about? Now stop askin' stupid doorknob questions. Well, a year and a half ago, this friend of mine got access to the evidence room for an hour. He snagged this coke. But, he's a good cop with a wife and a kid, so he sat on it for a year and a half until he found a guy he could trust.
Apparently I'm not as dumb as you thought I am.
Where'd you go?
Why does he trust you?
Isn't she the sweetest goddamned girl you ever saw in your whole life? Is she a four alarm fire, or what?
Daddy. Nice isn't the word. Nice is an insult. She's a peach. That's the only word for it, she's a peach. She even tastes like a peach. You can tell I'm in love with her. You can tell by my face, can't ya? It's a dead giveaway. It's written all over it. Ya know what? She loves me back. Take a seat, Pop, we gotta talk -
Stop acting like an infant. You're here because you want me to help you in some way. What do you need from me? You need money?
What makes you think I would do that?
You got it all worked out, don't you?
Do you know who I am, Mr. Worley?
I'm the Anti-Christ. You get me in a vendetta kind of mood, you will tell the angels in heaven that you had never seen pure evil so singularly personified as you did in the face of the man who killed you. My name is Vincenzo Coccotti. I work as a counsel for Mr. Blue Lou Boyle, the man your son stole from. I hear you were once a cop so I assume you've heard od us before. Am I correct?
I'm glad. Hopefully that will clear up the how-full-of-shit-I-am question you've been asking yourself. Now, we're gonna have a little Q and A, and, at the risk of sounding redundant, please make your answers genuine.  Want a Chesterfield?
What are you talkin' about?
Yeah, and the restaurant's on my route. And you know, I stuck my nose in for the company to try to put a stop to some of these break-ins. Now, while I have no proof, the name Drexl Spivey kept comin' up Who's case is it?
I don't know. He just appeared as magic.
Dirty cops. We'll have to bring in internal affairs on this.
Look, sunshine, we found a sandwich bag of uncut cocaine -
But a fuckin' baggie.
He's so spooked he'd turn over his momma, his daddy, his two-panny granny, and Anna and the King of Siam if he had anything on him.
He knows.
Naw man, that's some serious shit.
Yeah, that's right, laugh. It's so funny, oh it's so funny.  There used to be a time when sisters didn't know shit about gettin' their pussy licked. Then the sixties came an' they started fuckin' around with white boys. And white boys are freaks for that shit -
You gotta hold this for me.
You're the one who wanted to drive fast.
Sorta room-mates?
How do you know? You been there?
Yes.
What was the Jew-boy's name?
We want you to tell us about last night.
Women will want to get to know you...
The food, the sky, the certain, uh, sexual temptations -- you haven't become "addicted" have you, Cole?  To that "dying" world'
What kind of information?
I see.  You don't remember assaulting a police officer...several officers?
July.
You think it's July of 1995?  That's the future, James.  Do you think you're living in the future?
Cole!  James Cole!  You escaped from a locked room six years ago.
I can't believe this is a coincidence, Mr. Cole.  Have you been...following me?
You used to call me "James".
Does that disturb you, James?  Thinking about that little boy in the well?
Look, I'm warning you.  You do anything, I'm going to go crazy -- hurt people!
You didn't have a gun before, did you?
Nobody is going to wipe out the human race.  Not you or Jeffrey or anybody else.  You've created something in your mind, James -- a substitute reality. In order to avoid something you don't want to face.
I don't understand what we're doing.
James, you said he was hiding in the barn...
No superiors!  No scientists.  No people from the future.  It's just a Carpet Cleaning Company.  They have voice mail -- you leave a message telling them when you want your carpet cleaned.
You... you couldn't have heard me.
I have seen it, but I don't remember this part.  Funny, it's like what's happening to us, like the past.  The movie never changes -- it can't change -- but everytime you see it, it seems to be different because you're different -- you notice different things.
They may be looking for us, James.  Use this.  You can fix it in the Men's Room.
James, if we're identified, they're going to send us someplace...but not to Key West!
Does this bother you, Mr. Cole?
Who would you call, Mr. Cole, who would straighten everything out?
So you could talk to these scientists and they do what?  Send you to the future?
What are you talking about???
What...???
I asked you, why did you volunteer?
Kathryn, you know he can't possibly know that.  You're a rational person. You're a trained psychiatrist.  You know the difference between what's real and what's not.
One dozen bolt cutters!  Whadda you gonna do with one dozen bolt cutters?
That would explain the bruises, I guess.  The struggle.
Change?  You want my change?  I fought the war and lost my eyes just so I could give you my change?
Don't forget to open it for me.  I can't be opening my own bottle.
I think I've heard that before.
Ain't you got a little something for the infirm?
The day wasn't so bad.  We all got through it all right.
You're a hell of a pessimist, old man.
You afraid of the dark?
We're all just floating along like twigs in a stream, so enjoy the ride.  Is that it?
Not this twig, friend.  I got plans.
One-hundred-thirteen degrees.  That was back in July of forty-seven. Now there ain't no way it's gonna be hotter than that.
It's nonsense.
And what are you?  A rocket scientist?
Can I help you, sir?
But, in particular?
Then why do you call it Harlin's?
I'll be back in a couple of hours. And be careful with her, will you?
How much?
How much!?
About an hour and a half, because that's all the longer I've been gone.
No charge.
Two-hundred.
It's going to cost you two-hundred dollars.
Yep.  For the hose.  But while you was gone I replaced a gasket. That's going to run you another fifty.
Is that an insult?  Are you insulting me.
What you want?
I don't want no dirty money.  I run an honest business.
Now that you're so well off, can I get you something, Hon?
No.  We got Miller.  Regular Miller. You want it, or don't you?
There you go, Mrs. McKenna.  Just put it in there.
Who was that on the phone?
How could I?  I was sleeping.
I don't hear anything.  You were dreaming.  Or maybe the wind blew something over.
Jake, what is that?
Oh my God, Jake, no.  If it is someone they'll go away.  Or call the police.  Don't go out there.
Do you have to call me that?
Jesus.
That a fact?
Yes, I have.
That's good.  Cools you right off.  I saw you watching me.
What do you do anyway?
Nice house for a Shaman's daughter. You must be good.
There.  All done.  Lift me down.
Beautiful?
No more drapes to hang.  Now what should we do?
You flirt with me, then you run cold.  You lead me on, then slap me down.  I don't go for being jerked around.
Damn it, Grace!  Tell him.
I'm guessing no.
I don't know how.
It's not that easy.  Maybe you can take chances; maybe you can wander around like some stray wherever you please.  I can't.  I don't want to be alone.  I need to know I'm going to be taken care of.
How far is it to California?
Jake.
Near as I can figure must be about a hundred-thousand.
I don't think we have anything to talk about.
There is no us, remember?
Why the hell didn't you do anything?
Where's the safe?
Oh, that's great.  We killed Jake because you heard him talk about some money that you've never seen. That's fucking brilliant!
Nothing.  There's no safe under here.
If you want.
That's all talk.  He's got nothing on us.  He let you kill Jake.
Is that the kind of girl you think I am?  What can I do to make you relax?
Are you kidding?  I'm not going down with you for killing a cop.
John!
It's . . . it's locked.
No.  I swear it.
Someone will find me.
I . . I was helping your wife.  I met her in town.  She needed a hand with her drapes.  That's all.
I swear to you that's all that happened.  I haven't so much as set foot in your bedroom.
What happened to your hand?
You've got to be--
I'm a solid man.
What brings you to Sierra?
Talk?  About what?
Sweet Grace?  What about her?
You said you'd cut that up with the man who did her in.
You meant it.
Just to get out of here?  That doesn't seem much for a murder.
I put it at fifty-thousand dollars, minus your cut, of course.  Which is?
Drop it, Jake.
It's not like that.
Jake--
You'd tell me anything to save your pathetic life.
I want to stay.
What happened to your hand?
You like Patsy Cline?  I just love her.  How come, I wonder, she don't put out no more new records.
Gee, that's sad.  Don't that make you sad?
But you was going to fight for me.
He's not my boyfriend.  I mean, I let him take me out and stuff, but I ain't spoken for.  Not yet that is.
Christ, I don't believe this.
Get up, Mister!  Don't ever let it be said Toby Tyler beat the living shit out of someone without giving them a fair chance.
I'm doing what any man would do if he'd been offended.  I'm beating you up.
Mexico?  You're going to Mexico?
He is at that.  No so much a fault of his own.  Poor boy had quite a trauma as a child.
Yep.  Tore him up good and spat out little, refined pieces of him. Nothing like the embarrassment of having your father refined in front of your classmates to put the anger in a young man.
Just cool down, son.  I ain't accusing you of anything.  Serves Toby right to get his ass whooped. If you hadn't done it, somebody else would've.
I call the policia.
No police.
Don't be sorry.  Just run over there and get me my pop before I die of thirst.
Ain't over yet.  Night is part of day; separate, but equal.  Night is when you let your guard down; when you see things in the shadows and hear things in the dark.
Afraid of it?  Boy, I live in the dark. All cause of a woman who made me this way. People are afraid of what they can't see. I can't see nuthin', so it's all the same to me.  Kiss from a beautiful woman, kissy kissy kiss, a lick from a dog, slurp, slurp, the kiss of death . It's all the same to me.
I don't care what you believe as long as you leave me alone.
Christ, I don't believe this!
What the fuck do you want?
After you huffed off, Grace lied so bad, I got so pissed off, I pulled down her pants to paddle her ass raw and finger-fucked it instead. Sorry I lost my cool like that. It's a funny thing, women.
You've got to be--
I guess we've never been introduced proper. Jake McKenna.
"You can't shoot 'em!" I like that.  I bet she led you on good, didn't she?  Taking you up to the house to hang drapes. Oh that's a good one. Bet she had you hard as a rock wiggling her ass in your face.  I bet you just wanted to pull down her pants and hog her out. Then me busting in like some wild bear. Ha! Bet you had a fire going under you.
You said you'd cut that up with the man who did her in.
You meant it.
Because you're a slimy bastard who would have his wife killed just to get his hands on some money.
Well, I guess I have what you call a love-hate relationship with Grace.
You drive a hard bargain, but I had a feeling you were my boy when I met you.
Next time you'll do just fine.
You have a lot of talk in you, whole lot of talk.
How the hell did you know where the bedroom's at?
You like Patsy Cline?  I just love her. How come, I wonder, she don't put out no more new records.
You're not from around here, are you? Where you from?
Hey mister. Mister, I just... I just wanted to thank you.
You're too late, Toby.  We're going to get in his fancy car and ride off and leave you behind.
Don't be afraid of him none.  I don't care what he does to you, we can still be together.
You Harlin?
Will he be back soon?
You own this place?
You want to take a look at my car?  I think the radiator hose is--
Look, Harlin, I've got places to be.
So?
Great!
How much time?
Hundred-fifty.
A goddamn radiator hose in a sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang.  You know how long it took me to find that hose?
I don't know, but "it's the reason I'm living here and you're just passing through."  Now you owe me a hundred-fifty dollars.
Hey there.  I was beginnin' to think you wasn't comin' back...  You don't look so good.
Yep.  For the hose.  But while you was gone I replaced a gasket.  That's going to run you another fifty.
Well, now, you just know all there is about bein' a mechanic, don't you?  Didn't you read the sign.
The goddamn sign on the wall. I can't do unauthorized work?  What am I suppose to do? Just let you ride out of here with a bad gasket.  Then you get in an accident and get killed.  Or worse.  Who they gonna blame then?  They gonna blame me, and there goes my reputation.
Is that an insult?  Are you insulting me.
I don't want no dirty money.  I run an honest business.
Got any cold soda?
Soda.  You got any soda?
Can I give you a hand, beautiful?
Where you coming from?
You've been around.
Nice house for a shaman's daughter.  You must be good.
My face tell you all that?
No more drapes to hang.  Now what should we do?
You flirt with me, then you run cold.  You lead me on, then slap me down.  I don't go for being jerked around.
I think I can find my own way back to into town.
You never did answer my question.
That's not an answer.  What is it you want?
All this nothing? It doesn't get to Jake like it gets to me.  He says he don't mind being nothing but a big fish in a small pond.  More like a little fish in a dried up watering hole.
I don't know how.
You'd never understand.
Where?
What do you mean?
In <u>cash</u>?
It takes a key.  He keeps it on himself all the time.  I mean <u>all the time</u>.  It scratches up against me when we do it.
I wanted to talk.
Why?  Am I making you hot, or does the truth scare you?
I could if I had Jake's money.
Bobby?  What the hell's the matter with you?
I can't see it.
We've still got some dead weight to get rid of.
I want a place where only the vultures will find him... It'll be over soon, Grace.
Get real Bobby. He was gonna kill you <u>and</u> me.
Why? So when the cops catch up with us you can sell me out again?
When you're finished with me, I'm next! I been there, baby. I been there with other cunts...sorry, not anymore. I'll take you as far as California. If we can make that. After that you're on your own. Try Mexico. With all this bread, you can live like a queen.
And I love you too.
Where ya goin'?
That's a nasty cut you got there.
There was a young fellow over at Jamilla's today when it got hit.  Way she tells it he got whacked around good by one of the robbers.
That's a shame, Bobby.  A real shame.
I need a ticket.
Out of here.
Genuine Draft?
Morning Grace.
Well, he offered, and I just couldn't refuse. His car overheated.
You never said anything.  About the drapes.
They look nice.
Ya little bitch, you like it don't you! You like it this way -- rough and hard. Gotta go fuck around on me, like your Mama, but you always gotta come home to Daddy, don't you, cause you know Daddy's the best.
Yeah, I heard a key slapping against my ass.
Where's the fire sweetheart? Don't know how they work things in Nevada, but we got speed limits in this state.
What about Jeb?
I'm still going to New York. Just not this second.
Okay.
Not a specific day. What's this about?
Is there anything else you wanted to ask me while I'm up?... When was the last time you wore pink? When was the last time you drank soup standing up? Final call for strange questions at two in the morning.
He didn't do anything. He just told me his theory... It's sad when patients get like that. They loose reality.
I didn't know that. Mine's still brown.
Soft and Wet, by the Artist Formerly Known as Prince.
What about the game?
Why?
You forgot the "Now I'm going to tell you what the hell is going on" step. See usually that comes before the, "It's over" Step. And it always, always comes before the "You can go" Step.  What is over?
Probably the army jacket. Those guys carry hunting knives and stuff for show.
I don't know what you're asking?
Okay, I don't want to play this game anymore.
I have to go now.
Stop messing with my life Elijah. My son almost shot me last night. He wanted to prove you were right.
He's spoken of you. He says you're becoming friends.
Dunne, it's Jenkins, we got a guy at gate 17C with a bogus ticket. Says he knows you. He won't tell me his name.
He's got the most beautiful eyes... The hell kind of question is that? He's a guy.
Yeah?
Why'd you do that?
You think you could beat up Mike Tyson? I mean before he started wiggin out and eating people's ears?
How are you feeling?
Now you're going to have to tell me more.
For a second there I thought you were a fanatic.
No more sitting in this room. I've let it go on long enough.
If they was just here for the fuckin', how come they lit out the back window?
You just kicked the shit out of a innocent man, you big asshole.
Rain's coming.
That Kid... he's just a... boy. And that other one, Bill, being true to his wife...
Why, if you were to point a pistol at a King or a Queen, sir, I can assure you your hand would shake as though palsied...
Now this Strawberry Alice person, tell me again.
We never seen him up against any... like these ones... killers.
He give 'em names?
Scouting?
Oh. How long I been here?
Are you really going to kill them?
You're a beautiful woman an'... if I was to want a free one, I guess I'd want you more than them others. It ain't... See... I can't have no free one on account of my wife...
Books. He's my biographer.
Not really...  Maybe a couple of Peacemakers...  I imagine you could overlook those, eh, Bill? If you didn't see them... or hear them?
No... but I guess he will soon enough. Had a Spencer rifle on him an' he was...
Well, Mister Hendershot, if I was to call you a no good sonofabitch an' a liar, an' if I was to say you shit in your pants on account of a cowardly soul... well, I guess then, you would show me your pistol right quick an' shoot me dead, ain't that so?
You work for the railroads too, Mister Beauchamp?
It's only a b-b-b-book...
That is you there, ain't it, Bob? The Duck of Death?
I believe that to be an accurate description of the events, sir... albeit there is a certain poetry to the language which...
First off... Corky didn't carry two pistols, though he should of.
Bam! That Walker Colt blew up in his hand... which was a failing common to that model. Now if Corky would have really had two guns instead of just a big dick he could have defended himself to the end.
But if the other fellow is quicker and fires first...
Been gone near three years now.
Well, we was. Like you said, I changed my mind an'...
Three ways, I figured.
You're goin' back with him?
Say, Bill. That business in Jackson County... did that really happen? I mean how they say it happened?
It's gonna get riper yet.
Cover me, Kid, while I mount.
Yeah, I guess so.
Say, Bill...
Well, that fella today, you shot him alright.
I trust you, Bill.
You could have it. All of it.
P-p-p-please, I'm not armed.  M-m-my G-god. You killed... Little Bill.
B-b-books.  You... you killed five men... singlehanded.
I was lucky in the order.  I always been lucky killin' folks.
How long since you shot a gun at a man?  Nine... ten years?
I ain't the same, Ned. Claudia, she... straightened me up, got me clear of the whiskey an' all. Us goin' to do this killin'... that don't mean I'm back to like I was. I just need the money... for a new start... for them youngsters.  Remember that drover, the one I shot in the mouth so's the teeth come out the back of his head? I dream about him now an' again. I didn't have no reason to shoot him... not one I could remember when I sobered up.
Nobody liked me... none of the boys. They was scared of me... figured I might shoot 'em out of pure meanness.
Quincy, he was always watchin' me. Scared.
Some fucker's shootin' at us.
He hit you?
He ain't shootin' our way no more.  He's shootin' over that way. Who's he shootin' at over that way?
No.
Yeah?
I seen him.
Worms was comin' out.
Claudia... ain't here, Bill.
I seen her... I seen Claudia too...
I'm goin' on down to Kansas.
That fella come by... Tom.
He say anythin'... The Kid... ?
K-k-kill somebody?
Clouds, Kid. We was lookin' at them clouds on account of we got a storm ridin' up our ass.
Fuck you.
He didn't even pull his pistol, huh?
We done that stuff.
I'll ride up close an' shoot 'em!
&lt;&lt;It is longer than that. And not so dark. &gt;&gt;
...and the desk Sergeant is actually trying to tell me he can't release you? Can you believe that? You weren't even charged. New York police - Jesus. I want to take pictures of your face to bring to the D.A. first thing in the morning.
I'11 have this thing in front of a grand jury by Monday.
Give me some credit. I got you this far, let's go to the grand jury. This is never going to stop if we -
That's enough, Edie.
Forget him. It's not important. I was trying to make a point.
How many times have you been in a line- up? It's always you and four dummies. The P.D. pays homeless guys ten bucks a head half the time. No way they'd line five felons in the same row. No way. And what the hell is a voice line-.up? A public defender could get you off of that.
You're fuckin' A right, no P.C. Well screw P.C. No right. No goddamn right. You do some time, they never let you go. Treat me like a criminal, I'll end up a criminal.
DON'T MOVE, YOU FUCKERS.
He's alright.
Why don't you just calm down'
Keaton, we gotta go. They're gonna find him.
It's a logistical nightmare. Close quarters, no advance layout, ten men, maybe twenty.
Roger really. People say I talk too much.
How do you do?
I'11 be alright.
Three million?
My employer requires your services. One job. One day's work. Very dangerous. I don't expect all of you to live, but those who do will have ninety-one million dollars to divide any way they see fit.
My employer wishes to remain anonymous.
The answer is no.
Ahh, Mr. Hockney. Do join us.
What did you say?
Weapons. Misdemeanor two.
No matter. He'll have to know how close we came.
I'11 find him.
And I am sure you have a host of wild                   + theories to answer these questions.
You know Ruby is in Attica?
Oh come on, Verbal. Who do you think you're talking to? You really expect me to believe he retired? For a woman? Bullshit. He was using her.
You keep trying to lay this whole ride on                 t Keaton. It wasn't like that. Sure he knew, but Edie had him all turned around.                 r I'm telling you straight, I swear.                        +
No. But I'm sure Keaton's dead.
Do you believe in him, Verbal?
Where's your head, Agent Kujan? Where do you think the pressure's coming from? Keyser Soze - or whatever you want to call him - knows where I am right now. He's got the front burner under' your ass to let me go so he can scoop me up ten minutes later. Immunity was just to deal with you assholes. I got a whole new problem when I post bail.
But Keaton had. Edie Finneran was his extradition advisor. She knew who he was and what he knew.
Edie...
You're joking.
Mr. Abraham...
No -- we don't want this case in court.
Whatever the `truth' is, let's hear that.  You were her doctor.
Answer affirmatively.  Simply. Keep those answers to three words. You weren't `part of a group,' you were her anesthesiologist.  Isn't that right?
We've touched on this, his own witness has said...
Objection!
Dr. Thompson, just so the Jury knows, you never treated Deborah Ann Kaye.  Is that correct?
Engaged to render an opinion.  For a price.  Is that correct?  You're being paid to be here today?
What book is that?
How old are you?
Uh-huh.  Still practice a lot of medicine?
Thank you, your Honor.  We object to the copy of the admissions form as incompetemt and essentially hearsay evidence and cite McGee versus State of Indiana, U.S. 131 point 2 and 216 through 25 of the Uniform Code:  'The admission of a duplicate document in preference to an existing original must presuppose the possibility of alteration and so must be disallowed.'  And, your Honor, having given the Plaintiff the leeway we would like your ruling on this issue now:  we object to the admission of the Xerox form.
You would not...?
In fact, you've just taken an oath that you would not commit perjury. You've just sworn to that.  Isn't that right?
That's not my handwriting.
...she went in complaining of stomach cramps.  Good doctor would have doubted the information on the chart.
I am on the staff of...
She getting good care over there?
Are you saying that a failure to restore the heartbeat within nine minutes in itself constitutes bad medical practice?
I...given the limits of your question, that's correct.
I'm going to take you to the home to see the girl...
Dr. Towler; page 406, 'Contraindications to general anaesthetic.  Ideally a  patient should refrain from taking nourishment up to nine hours prior to induction of general anaesthetic.'  Does that sound familiar?
Dr. Gruber ...
Yes.
The most respected ...
The hospital is owned by the Archdioceses of ...
Well, well, when can we meet again. I'd like to get a deposition..
We have to ... we ... we have to keep you under wraps.  Please don't, don't discuss ...
I can subpoena you, you know.  I can get you up there on the stand.
I do.  Who is it?  The Doctors. What do you owe them?
Then why don't you testify?
Now, have you boys tried to resolve your little difficulty because that certainly would save the Commonwealth a lot of time and bother.
Do we have time this morning to... All right.  Mr. Galvin, you want to continue now, or we can resume with Dr. Thompson this afternoon.
Sustained.  Yes.  The witness will confine his testimony to review of the hospital records.
I can't guarantee that...
We find that your subscription lapsed...
We have a renew-your-subscription offer...
I'm a lawyer.
Would you like me to leave...?   Is this a bad time --?
What happened...?
Dr. Gruber.
I had an appointment at his office, I think I must have got it wrong. We had a meeting...
Sally Doneghy, now who is that?
Okay.  What do you do when you don't have a witness?
She's protecting the Doctors she'd be up there on the stand...
... I know.  I went ...
Are we going to win?    We have, you know, other tactics, though...
I spoke to her, and everything is all right.
Another, Frank . . . ?
...of the procedures...
But those notations stop...  ...four-and-one-half minutes after Deborah Ann Kaye's...
Yes.
He won't talk.
And you like it.
Shouldn't you be sitting down?
Would you like a drink now?
I'm afraid some harm may come to her.
No.
Yes, but carefully. I'd want to know more before committing her to that kind of care.  Scottie --
How can I see her, to know her?
Yes.
No, she's all right. She's still here. But I'll get her home soon.
Could I ask you a couple of questions?
No, there are just a few things I want to ask you, and --
What do you want to know?
It's a place to live, that's all.
And what will I live on? My oil wells in Texas?
Oh, Well, thank very much. But no thanks.
Oh, I understand, all right. I've been understanding since I was seventeen. And the next step is, as long as you're going to see me tomorrow, why don't you stay the night.
No? Then what?
As friends? We'd just see a lot of each other as friends, and you'd "take care of me"?
Why?  Because I remind you of someone?  That's not very complimentary.  And nothing would... happen...
No, Judy, I'm not going to move! Please! Stay in the chair!
Judy, it can't make much difference to you. I just want to see how you'd look and I know it won't be the same, but --
I'm suddenly hungry. Would you rather go somewhere else?
No, I don't want to go. I want to stay here.
And I couldn't follow her.  God knows I tried.  One doesn't often get a second chance. I want to stop being haunted. You're my second chances, Judy.
We're going up the tower.
Love me... keep me safe...
Do you remember where you were?
Please drink your coffee.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be rude.
When you...  There were pins in my hair...
I shall call you Mr. Ferguson.
I... suddenly felt such a fool.
I hope we will, too.
Meet again, sometime.
Good-bye.
No.
Do you know where you're going?
Their true name is Sequoia Sempervirens: always green, ever- living.
Where were you born?
When you jumped in the bay, you didn't know where you were. You guessed but you didn't know.
No, I can't tell you!
There is so little I know. It is as though I were walking down a long corridor that once was mirrored, and fragments of mirror still hang there, dark and shadowy, reflecting a dark image of me... and yet not me... someone else, in other clothes, of another time, doing things I have never done... but still me... And I can't stop to ask why, I must keep on walking. At the and of the corridor there is nothing but darkness, and I know when I walk into the darkness, I'll die.  But I've never come to the and; I've always come back, before then. Except once.
If I could find the key... find the beginning put it together...
Yes --
Tell me.
No... we're together...
It's not fair, it's too late. It wasn't supposed to happen this way, it shouldn't have happened...!
And if you lose me, you'll know that I loved you and wanted to go on loving you.
Oh, dear! Has she done something wrong?
I can't imagine that sweet girl with that dear face --
Yes, that's it. Sweet name, isn't it?  Foreign. But sweet.
Oh, it must be two weeks. Yes, the rent's due tomorrow.
Oh, but she hasn't been here today. Scottie whirls back on her.
Her car is gone.
Not with my Acrophobia, Midge. If I dropped a pencil on the floor and bent down to pick it up, it could be disastrous!
It's a brassiere. You know about those things. You're a big boy, now.
An aircraft engineer down the peninsula designed it. He worked it out in his spare time.
Yeah, I'm a brute. We were engaged once though, weren't we?
Ah, sweet college days. But you're the one who blew it. I'm still available. Available Ferguson. Say, Midge, do you remember a guy at college named Gavin Elster?
Could be.
Now, that's the kind of greeting a girl likes.  None of this "hello you look wonderful" stuff. Just a good straight "who do you know" --
Professor Saunders, over in Berkeley.
Oh!  You mean Gay Old Bohemian Days of Gay Old San Francisco!  The juicy stories? Like who shot who in the Embarcadero August, 1879?
Wait a minute! You're not a detective any more. What's going on?
What have you been doing?
Yes... the Beautiful Carlotta... the Sad Carlotta...
She died.
Oh, yes! It may need some slight alterations, but it is madam's size.  All right, dear.  We'll have it for you to try in a moment.
Well...
Can't do what?
What's that?
We're leaving from my house in three hours. If you want to come, get your numbers in order by then.
Oh, and why am I an asshole?
I don't know why the floor was wet!
Why?
This is pathetic.
Don't you threaten me you little rat fuck.
Go home!
Don't even start.
Wait!
What do you think you are doing?
Just wait a second. Wait one second. Okay. What are you doing?
Her fucking head was caved in.
Wrap her up in blankets. Bring the car around to the back of the hotel, throw her off the balcony, put her in the car...Done.
Well what the fuck are we supposed to do?
Boyd you idiot, the shit's coming down!
What?
You got some mighty fucking fine bad timing Adam. We got a rehearsal situation here.
The bucks gonna stop right here.  If my son doesn't know the six New England states, if he has trouble with geography, I won't stick it in his face. I'll help the little guy. I'll put him in the car and take him out there. I'll take him to Maine for a big Lobster dinner, go skiing in Vermont, hot dogs at Yankee Stadium...I won't stare him down.
Either side you idiot. I'm calling 911.
Have you thought about what I said?
Money?
What are you talking about?
He's upset about Adam. We're all upset.
Okay. Hi.
Who?
Your investment ideas never work out.
He just had two.
He's too drunk.
Not really.  Yes, the Fisher wedding chairs...
Oh God. This is insane.
Nobody knows she's here.
All right people. New plan. Not even a new plan so much as a modification of the old plan.
It goes; "Today is the first day of the rest of our lives."
He's cracked up.
What?
I don't know! I just want to get married.
Jesus Boyd you're going to O.D. him.
I'm talking about Lois having relaxed her anxiety. Only deal is...you still got Micheal there?
That it was all an accident. She wants to hear it from Micheal's mouth.
This is a situation that defies judgement. We have acted and showed courage that is not of a kind known by most.
Blood money. Insurance dollars that you have thus fucking far decided not to tell me about at all. In no way have you mentioned that money. And I find that to be very very offensive.
The hell I did!
Then what do they have?
Now if I'm the King of Israel and all these sand niggers are armed to the gills and you know it's just a matter of time ...right? Am I right?
Take Mexico.
A little gut check time fellas. A time for some serious self-exploration. How do I function? For real? No more bullshit. Can I keep my cool when they bounce my bananas? When they won't play my fucking song? etc, etc. Do you get me? Do you get me?
Oh that's just nothing. That's just a missing persons thing, that's all.
Okay Micheal, let's go.  Upsy daisy big guy.
Can't we do it on the phone?
The wedding cake check?
You can't play around with these tent people.
I'm working my ass off here. I've taken care of absolutely everything Keith.
Stop it. I'm sorry.
I wouldn't know.
They organized this, not me. I have nothing to do with it.
He's my friend. He's not a moron.
Charles Moore for instants.
He's a great chef.
Time out.
That's absurd.
We've got problems here.
Not padded ones.
Go down to the seat place and straighten this out.
I need your help.
I need your help.
Do you love me?
Will you please call the chair people?
Just call and let me know that your okay.
Well, the night is young. Did you straighten out the chair situation?
That's sweet.
Go have fun. Not too much.
Yeah baby. Everything's great.
No way.
Lois is a mess and Micheal's really upset. Everyone's upset.
What?
Where did you get that?
Do you hear buzzing Fish?
Yeah, well, it's a nasty problem.
I appreciate it. I do, but...Maybe you ought to just ease up om yourself a bit.
No...No.
He came to me early today, was talking about money, insurance money. Said he was gonna get what was his.
I guess.
There.
I think you'd make an excellent Big Brother.
She's dead.
Fucking desert.
Keep quiet. These miserable brats only get in the way.
Didn't you say you know how to make vanilla pudding?
Stop this, stop this.
Don Amalio!
Excellent. What a charming, peaceful place, Uncle.
You have no feelings toward ...
Come down here, you scamp.
I'm going to make you a nun's cake. It will make your mouth water.
What do you mean?
Never.
No, Uncle; ashes mean penance and death.
This evening we must do something special by way of a farewell.
You're lying.
Why don't you speak to her, Ramona? Women are good at that sort of thing. Think of something that will make her stay a few more days.  You are kind, Ramona! Speak to her. I know I don't need to offer you anything, but, if you're successful in this, I'll not forget you or your little girl.
What for? She'll only look at me that way again ... I couldn't. You go. Perhaps she'll listen to you. Try to convince her.
Don't lie. You don't believe me either.
It's very good.
So, Ramona!
What are you thinking about?
Maybe afterwards he'll let me ...
I don't want you to untie me. Kill him and then I'll give you the money.
Miss Viridiana ...
I don't understand how you can like being alone so much.
Is that all you're going to devote your life to?
They're varicose veins. It isn't leprosy.
You'll soon find out, you liar!
How do you do, Miss Viridiana!
There's been an accident.
Why are you crying?
What's going on, Moncho?
In you go! Moncho, lead the way!  You stay here.
I hardly know him. I saw him only once, some years ago. I can't even remember him.
I have no desire to see the world again, but if you order me to...
Good morning. You weren't expecting me, were you?
Would you mind telling me what I did wrong to you to deserve your insults?
What?
It was very well—hidden. There was no way to see it until it was too late.
What are they doing in Los Feliz?
Do I need to remind you what happened to his wife? To his daughter?  I will stake my reputation that Barnes didn't kill those guards.
You know those cheesy Christmas cards of your family under that tree in your back yard you keep sending me every year?
These were taken inside LETAC an hour ago. Pretty pictures, aren't they?
She's going to help you understand what makes Sid 6.7 tick.
Sid 6.7 is now armed.
She saved your life, Parker. She didn't have to, but she did.
I should have told him.
Give me 30 seconds, then flip every switch you can reach.
What did you find out?
It's already been called off. Witnesses confirmed you weren't the shooter.  Did you find out where the bomb is?
Simulations are supposed to give participants practice in realistic, dangerous scenarios while protecting them from the risks they are exposed to in the real world.
It makes me nervous just seeing him in a uniform.  I will never forget the first time I saw the photos from the crime scene.
You are to turn over the Sid 6.7 program, and all its documentation, for immediate destruction. Is that understood?
It's better than real. It's synthetic flesh. Synthetic blood. Synthetic organs...  It's a physiological machine.
As far as the public is concerned, it is. The reason you got fired, and I got my second demo into production, is I'm a lot smarter than you. I never give my best stuff away.
You need a maid.
How should I know?
I wonder how that...
He's developing a hemisphere imbalance.
You catching my drift?
You made me a composite of 183 of the most vicious people who ever lived.  What do you think I'm doing?
John died.
If I had died yesterday, you'd have already dissected my brain and analyzed it to see if I carry any genetic predisposition toward violence.
I need to know what snapped in you. What made you capable of it. You have to make me understand.
Learn anything from Lindenmeyer's file?
What happened when he was 17?
Who said that?
Lindenmeyer put increasingly complex combinations of criminal psychological profiles together to develop the ultimate villain.
Give me your wrist.
Told you I wasn't going to go anywhere.
She's beautiful, you know?
What the hell's going on?!
What's the problem?
Whatever he was doing here was only the start.
It's not just Sid 6.7's performances that are increasing. Stars need bigger and bigger audiences.  Whatever Sid is going to do next, it's going to involve media.
How did you find out about the toxin?
The rally's a little obvious as a target, don't you think?
Find out anything?
What do we do now?
Where's John?
I'm sorry, the party you're trying to reach is not answering. Is there anyone else you would like to talk to?
What C-4...was Cox talking about?
Aren't you going to watch with me?
To the first LETAC engineer to go into production on prototypes.
As long as they keep overpaying me, I'll keep overpaying you.  ) Just make goddam sure you can have 10 of them ready for deployment around the city by next month.
What about it?
Alright, well, alright:  geopolitically...
Y'see, <u>this</u> is what Producing is:  you put me in a <u>Room</u>...
What can it hurt.
Okay.  Here's what we're gonna do.
Mr. President, this is St...
...where?
Who we got here...?
We are virtually certain it isn't...
Front page.  Washington Post.  Tomorrow.
What crisis?
It won't hold, Ronnie, it won't prove out.
Gimme twenty thousand dollars.
Twenty thousand dollars.
Tell me again.
...the... 
...but...
Why?
What did they ever do <u>for</u> us...?  You see, this is why we have to mobilize the B-2 Bomber.
The hostages, but that was a naturally-occuring...  It was a put-up job?  But where was the, where was the money in that?
...can we see the Kitten...?
Why is this putz on the air...
We're bring'n im in tomorrow, five AM.
Catching up on his reading.  Asked about you, sends his thanks.
Maybe he's just a <u>patriot</u>.
...this is magnificent.
What are we going to do?
He thinks it's too...
Ronnie says we don't need'em for another four days.  ...s'there a problem?
Pride of a job-well-done...
...child at the airport...  breaks through the ranks, runs to "old shoe" -- should we have <u>flower</u> or a <u>bear</u>...?
All Combat takes place at night, in the Rain, and at the Junction of four Map Segments...
... you want Schumann saved by an Illegal Alien...?
I'd like to mention a few <u>names</u>, who...
...where is my pill?
But, you know, <u>this</u> is the meeting, Ron?  You think about it.  <u>This</u> is the meeting.  This, here.  Schumann and us.  King Kong and the Trainers...this's it... What are you working on?
ON MOSS, AS HE WALKS THE GROGGY SCHUMANN TOWARD THE GAS STATION.
We're locked into Albania.
Schumann. We're gonna go pick him up tonight.
S'only got to hold for another few days.
What's on your mind?
...why?
Is there a press conference today?
Dartmouth
Trade Re1ations.
And you're here <u>why</u>...?
What one has to do, Mr. Moss.  Is to fight a holding action.
Remember the Maine...
You know, you're a <u>writer</u>, that's your script.  You're a <u>director</u>...  But if you're the <u>producer</u> ... what did you do?  What did you do?  All you've got is the <u>credit</u>...  Some plaque on the wall...
Hell, I'd just do it for the <u>hell</u> of having <u>done</u> it, for a story to tell...
Hey, I know that, hey, I'm <u>kidding</u>...  "It's a pageant"
What do we have that they want?
We've just got to hold their interest for ten more days, till the Election.
You can't have a war without an enemy.
Three-o-three...
What?
The War ain't over. 
...this the Guy.
Medal.  Medal and Ribbon.
The Albanian Campaign.
I thought they weren't meeting him at the airport...
I think we asked for "special programs" and they gave us "special prisons."
He's going to be fine, aren't you boy...?
No, I didn't think so.
Uh huh...why?
No, I'm On Top of it...
You see?  What's the lesson here?  <u>Never</u> give up. <u>Never</u> give up.

Fox says Bluestar just hit 23. What do you want him to do?
Grand Marnier.
If I'm closing out this account. If he doesn't pay for it tomorrow, you pay for it.
...if I had your looks, better.
Wanna play some tennis Saturday?
Looks bearish to me, buddy. You got it all upside down.  Okay, I'm giving this to you and you alone, 'cause I feel sorry for you. Take the Knicks against the Bullets, and my pick of the day -- Duke to beat the spread against Wake Forest.
Buddy, buddy, when ya gonna realize it's big game hunters that bag the elephants, not retail brokers. I heard this story about Gekko... he was on the phone 30 seconds after the Challenger blew up selling NASA stocks short.
Sell?
I told you not to go into that racket. You could've been a doctor or a lawyer,
You get on the phone and ask strangers for their money, right? You're a salesman.
So come home and live rent free, 'stead of that cockroach palace you live in. $50,000 Jesus Christ, the world is off its rocker. I made $37,000 last year and you...
...Got a 100 on me, you...
... it adds up Buddy, 300 here, 200 there. Your brother never...  ...well, I always said money is something you need in case you don't die tomorrow...
The FAA announcement.
Dad, you know Duncan Wilmore, pilot's union, and Toni Carpenter, flight attendants...
He's got your prick in his back pocket, son, and you're standing naked in the display window of Macy's. He's using you. Only you're too blind to see it.
What you see, son, is a man who never measured success by the size of a man's wallet.
Hello, Natalie, you recognize the voice? I'll give you a hint, you're thinking seriously about marrying me...
It's in the bible, see. You better go buy him a present. Please, Natalie. Let me give him the gift; Cuban cigars--Davidoff, his favorite and hard to get.
How do you do Mr. Gekko. I'm Bud Fox.
See this? Can you believe it? Two inch screen...
Teldar's shooting up. Buy any for yourself? Bet you were on the phone two minutes after you got out of my office.
...come on sport, you gotta try harder, I need some exercise for chrissake...
Sir Larry Wildman. Like all Brits he thinks he was born with a better pot to piss in... bribed an old secretary of mine to open bar mouth and stole RDL Pharmaceuticals right out from under me. Wildman the white knight.
You're walking between the raindrops kid. I expect Sir Larry is choking on his royal chamber pot by now.
You don't understand. I want to be surprised...astonish me, sport, new info, don't care where or how you get it, just get it... My wife tells me you put a move on Darien. Here's some inside info for you. That Euroflash GQ guy she's going with's got big bucks but he's putting her feet to sleep. Exit visas are imminent. So don't lose your place in line.  Oh, jeez, I wish you could see this. The lights coming up over the water. I've never seen a painting that captures the beauty of the ocean at this moment.  ...an old Russian proverb - "a fisherman always sees another fisherman from afar." I like you sport, I ever tell you that... Gordon, call me Gordon from now on.
Got him at an auction in Kentucky.
The art of which is deception. Spread the buy orders through different accounts and you won't get burned...
I didn't know we had a meeting schedule for this morning.
What the hell do you want?
It's all about bucks, kid, the rest is conversation...  Bud, you're still going to be president. And when the time comes, you'll parachute out a rich man. With the money you're going to make, your father won't have to work another day in his life.
Buddy, it's not a question of enough. It's a zero sum game, sport. Somebody wins and somebody loses. Money itself isn't lost or made, it's simply transferred from one perception to another. Like magic. That painting cost $60,000 10 years ago. I could sell it today for $600,000. The illusion has become real. And the more real it becomes, the more desperately they want it. Capitalism at its finest.
Oh really?  Well, I guess you can kiss that career as an art appraiser goodbye, because we paid over four hundred thousand for it at the contemporary picture sale last June.
Not really. I'd say that Gordon is one of the most astute collectors around. He has a great eye and he only buys the best. Like this rug for instance, a silk Tabriz, the finest of its kind. The day after he bought it in London, a dealer representing the Saudi Royal Family offered him twice what he paid. It absolutely makes the room. See how this little bit of celadon in the border is picked up in the cushions oh the sofa... although...  I don't know if I would have used that tea dipped linen for the upholstery - too dingy. And it's a sacrilege having that Pre-Columbian pot in the center of the coffee table. Some dope might use it as an ashtray.
Where is it?
Do you think you're ready?
...that changes all my plans, I thought you were loaded...
Buddy, it's not your fault, and it's not your decision.
Hi.
You were never that innocent sugarpie.
You got a look in your eye, Mr. Mannheim... You got something for the small fry...
You told him about us?
I want to ask you a big favor, Gordon. Please drop the Bluestar deal.
I saw the greatest movie with mark last night
Anybody want another drink?
We need to talk. CHINA Yeah about what?
A little what? CHINA See.  You don't even speak French.
Weird and tiny huh?
Yes, it's always been one of my favorites too.
Would you like a closer look?
Jenkins.  Can I get you some help?
Hello?
No Jonathan.
Two of your friends left earlier MARK Uh huh.
Tony and China?
Haven't we been doing our homework.
Come on.
You aren't sick! We've got to get back.  What are you doing!
If my mother caught me up here she'd kill me.
Can this be stopped?
Stop saying things so loud!
Yes?
I know that.
I miss you.
Did you?
Why is he worried?
You think that'll help?
Me?  No.  Well, in the accident I was injured, but...
Toward the end.  You remember?
Tell me.  Please.
Have you ever felt so completely consumed by a feeling for someone that you couldn't breathe?  That the time together is so passionate and consuming that you felt physical pain when they would leave?
You must think I'm pathetic.
They're calling me in to work.
What was her major?
Wow.
How you holding up?
What is it?
Thanks, but I'm fine.
Absolutely.
Just bought this beautiful antique Ouija.
Place your fingers on the planchette.
Nothing's happening.
Oh...
What?
And he's the real thing.  Specializes in cases like this, like yours.
Oh God...you knew.
Adamant?
I got there first.  Stan covered up the pills and I had it out with Norman.  He seemed desperate not to lose you.  He promised to handle it.  And we all let it drop away.
Alight, alright.  Stay calm.  You opened this door.  There's got to be a way that you can close it.
She's awake.
Alright.  I can't take the rejection.  I'm going to class.
Whatcha reading?
And we moved out here for the quiet.
Honey, they're young.  They're probably newlyweds.
Remember how we were?
...when tonight they'll probably be keeping us awake.
Claire...
I just wish you could have heard her.
Hi.
Oh.
What do you mean?  Some noises where?
You didn't?
He killed her.
See?
When?
Oh.
Norman...
I never said...
Maybe you're right.  Maybe I'm losing my mind...
...I'm pulling up, Yuri.  I'll see you for dinner.  Sure you won't stay?
You know I am.
...I'm positive this time...
I don't like this, this...
I think she's starting to suspect something.
I came to work in the garden and I saw you with her...in my house.
Leave her out of this!
I tried to break it off!
She did it.
How can you be sure?
The leaves...
Adamant.
I'm cooking you dinner.
:What, you're doing Darcy? Since when?
I have seen him again.  Last night.
Lasher will act, Rowan.  Whatever it is he wants - he's waited three hundred years to have it.   facing him alone...  I don't like -
With his hands!
Jesus I've got - to get to the ho--
I ask only that you stay here, long enough to be - educated.  A few hours.
Aaron - lieten to me...  It's been Lasher - from the start!
Rowan...
I don't have any aunts - and I've never heard of a 'Carlotta' - or, for that matter - a 'Diedre'!  Just who -
My...mother...?
I don't want the -
Antha...your grandmother...her life ended there, on the stones. Head split open like a melon.
Mum...  Oh Mum, God will surely strike us -
You're very clever, aren't you...?
There is no one here but the dead.
Do not tell me that!
There was no thought.  There was no act.    That is not what I am.
Put - him - down!  His - his heart...
Harder...
They like you ------- kids.
Do they keep everything 'out' ...?
you're very --- different.
It's unbelievable that you can do that.
My mother and I used to take long walks and make up stories about the houses and the people who lived inside.  The Queen's house-. the Gangster's house-. the clown's house- Like that.
Why don't you let at do that...?
Doctor's orders- - -?
Christ, Michael - what the hell are we doing...?  We don't even know -
I called Dr. Styles at the Neurological Institute  In L.A., remember...?  He said he'd see you.  He was intrigned.
Michael - I have to go - to New Orleans. I'll - I'll call yati when I -
Do you love me, Michael...?
What about your work back home...?
Maybe the shrimp you bad last night.
No - I didn't kill him.   Would you rather I'd let them kill us - after they'd raped me...?
You alright...?
If it's a boy --- Taylor.
When aid you get home last night...?
Hi.
How 'bout a backward hex with a three-quarter twist...?
Well, Normie - you won't have to worry about this one being finished for a lonnnnng time.  How are the hands...?
I'm getting --- left behind.
Mikey - pregnant women get crazy you know that.  I mean - hell, they're all crazy anyway - right...?
I thought someone was following me - I - er -  I just needed my computer and some things...Listen, I'd like to work from home for a few weeks - is that OK?
That's very kind of you MR GRIFFITHS...?
I shouldn't say this - but you really remind me of someone I know
This must be one of the old keys -
Sugar?
Oh, about six years since I graduated
I don't know
Oh anywhere - whenever I needed to - Do you know how easy it is to take them? You just pick up a hiker, or someone off the streets - they believe so easily you know, 'Look, I have something to show you' I would say - and that would be it. One girl, I think her name is Debbie - she had broken down on the motorway, and I offered to take her to a service station to call for a tow truck - She just got in and I drove away. When I pulled into the layby and took out my knife - she just froze, and said - what do you want? - I said, You know what I want. - But she didn't. Getting rid of the bodies is just as easy - the first I cut up, put in bags with bricks in, and tossed them off Eldridge Bridge in broad daylight.  The real problem with my work is the blood - there is so much of it - and it all spurts out so fast - like a fountain. It made such a mess of
What did you do with her?
Is 'their' colour an expression of their inner self? By that I mean, extroverts wear bright colours - so what are people who wear white?
Do you feel sorry for the girls you have killed
How long have you been watching me?
What's wrong?
What is it?
I thought we had a relationship built on trust - and you just slap me in the face...
I don't like sugar
I don't want either of us to come to any harm - please...
Well, what do you think?
You're a novelist - why didn't you tell me?
That's good
Sugar?
...A bouncer? Are you serious?
Don't you know anything about limo etiquette? Everything in here is included for our pleasure.
I can't believe that's your mother. We're talking babe-a-licious chub fest, right here in the 501's.
How would you like it if I did that to your mother's panties?
I feel like I've just been hit by a Mack truck.
If it isn't straight by now, son, you probably should see a doctor.
I have to admit, I am so totally turned on. We should do it. Now.
Well?
I remember spring break of my senior year.  Seems like a lifetime ago.
Grandpa was so strong back then. Working from the crack of dawn. So proud of his peaches.
Be a sport. How bad could spring break in Los Angeles be?
I know they were simple people, but did this trip help your college fund at all?
The first time can be awkward. You just have to get on and try again.
It's your car. These are all your cars.
Or do you have a taste for the good life, Ted? It's in your blood.
Teddy? I was thinking.
Can you believe that was me?
So here we are. Dead. But we never want you to want for anything. That is, we want you to have everything.
Your parents never wanted to interfere with your life, Ted. They knew your Mom and Dad loved you very much. They knew they did the right thing. But that doesn't mean they didn't watch you and miss you, from afar.
How are the hometown folks treating you, back in Xenia?
Mom, Dad. Meatloaf has come to represent all that Ted hates about his mediocre life and the world we live in. He's what you'd call clinically bummed.
I miss them, too.
He was my Grandfather, too.
That's a crappy thing to say.
What is it, William Randolph? Your balls need scratching?
I'm still better than you. Nothing changed except the decimal point in your savings account.
I guess.
Don't write that part.
See? You're impertinent, rude, sarcastic.
I see.
It's all so complicated.
You're amazing.
A good journalist can take lemons and make lemonade. I'm honing my craft.
That's probably my office.
I don't know. This place seems pretty tame.
At least it's not another 4-H meeting or a Big Brother barbecue.
That has more to do with your proximity to me.
I see.
Do you trust me, Julie?
I have to be honest with you, Ted. I really despise "The Girls of Xenia."
Which explains the continued success of "Heaven" for how many decades?
Julie, wow. I was afraid you left. I was afraid I'd never see you again.
And I thought maybe I'd take up boating. I've always wanted to be a "coxswain."
The thing is, I'll need a first mate.
Planet Ted. Five years from now. What's happening?
They're playing our song.  Dare I ask for this dance?
What is this? Does everybody know everything I'm about to say or do every freakin' minute of the day?
I'm all right, Mom. I'm not in Siberia, you know.
Just a few tokens of my affection. I'll be back soon, don't worry.
You're free.  You can do anything you ever wanted to do!
With all due respect to Merk, he doesn't have to read my magazine. But he has no right to stop others.  Ever hear of the First Amendment?
What law, Merk? Having fun? Letting down our hair on prom night?
You do like girls, don't you?
Ah, in other words, this is the apres-orgy salon?
I told you you could do it.
Well...for one thing...I think it's despicable that we exclude so many women that only fit our western notion of "classic beauty."
The world is a big, beautiful place.  We can open new markets in Africa and Asia.  Imagine the Dali Lhama reading our magazine.
At our press conference tomorrow, I think we should announce our plans to explore the world. Not just a few leggy 36D's, with blond hair upstairs and down.
Don't forget to tell them all your qualifications.
Oh no. No way. I've had all the bad news I can take for one day.
So, did you set 'em all straight on the ugly facts of life?
Not that I'm going to be much good after last night...
She's going to wash your Jeep?
How soon can we get something?
Ray.  Stop calling.  I told you the dental records will take time...
Wasn't enough Van Ryan had to destroy the people who invested here.  He got to be old, he and his rich cronies would come down here, hunt and whore, act like assholes.  One trip he showed up with this young girl he'd picked up somewhere, gotten her pregnant then dumped her in the swamp.  That came with her.
The next thing... his hand was in my shorts... you know, from behind.  His fingers... his fingers...
He said something like, "Do you want it dirty7" or something.  I tried to turn away, but he pushed me to the floor.
Yes.  I said stop.  I screamed.  I mean that's how it sounded in my head.  He hurt me...
Did you try to fight him?
You mean he withdrew...
I don't know what to say...
Kelly's file.  Read it.  You're going to find an angry, sexually confused girl who's made threats on her mother's life and a female lover she'd never identify.
That would make it about the time of her old man's suicide.  You don't think that could explain some erratic behavior?
You can go up to one of those trees and peel the bark.  You know what you get? More bark.  And more bark.  There's no core.  Tree's not good tar anything but sucking up water.  And now they can't get rid of them.  They've tried poisons. Nothing works.  They don't die.
This is where she lives.  She wants to talk.  Beats the shit out of me why she would call me at all.  I busted her once for possession.  she wound up doing about six months at Camp Nine.
Where's the body?
Will you do me one favor?
I'm tired, Ray.  I'm going home.
He's leaving the country.  And I don't give a shit.
That bothers you?
Why?
Not that stuff about her running away, him trying to find her.  That's bullshit.
We've got three.  Guy mowing his yard, couple of kids playing hoops.
Kelly's next, Gloria.
You guess?  Did he or didn't he?
And then what... he touched you?  Did you maybe flirt a little...
Ms. Toller?
This wasn't my idea.
He was my friend at first.  Then I got busted... he didn't even stick up for me.  I had to go away to that hellhole. It's like, you're his favorite, then who cares?  You wanna know something?  When Kelly said we should do this, I thought cool, all these big shots screwing me over, like that cop, Duquette.  Now they're gonna get screwed.
Thank you, Jimmy.
It's those rocks, up there.
You are.
Is there some reason why you're here?
The thing about it is, threesomes so rarely work out.
Get off my property.
Don't bother.  I'm taking a trip.
So, where you off to now?
How much?
We have to stick with the plan.
Hello?
I can't help it.  He gives me the creeps... I mean why was Suzie so scared of him?  She's not that way.  I think he did something...
But check this...
Good thinking.
Can't you take that stupid thing off?
Come on, let loose!
No.
You ought to watch it with that shit, Suzie.  You get busted again, you go back in a two-tine loser.
Yeah, they're bad for your health.  I'm tryin' to look out for you...
Davy.
Why don't you tell us one more time, how Kelly came to be with you, alone in your house.
Like I said, I hadn't really expected to use it.  Anyway, I'm going through a drawer.  I hear a car.  I look out the window.  I see Nicole driving away.  I leave my room, and there's Kelly.
Hey, what did you want me to do, die?
Sam...
I was worried about you, Suzie.  I decided we should all get together, one more time, before we split up.
That was about as grim as it gets.
What's wrong?
Seems to like some of the same places you do.  Funny you never met.
I can't, Sandy.  I've got to run.
Sorry, Sandy.  I've got plans.
No.
Grab a clue, Sam.  You're a hired hand around here.  Enjoy it while it lasts.
Your little jack-in-the-box gun. That might be useful.
Damn it, this is ridiculous.
If you don't mind my asking, were you always the way you are?
No record of him.
Got to be somewhere that's hot. He said it was "damnably hot."
Damn, I wish this thing would go faster.
Not again.
So the idea is if a guy punches me, he really hurts his hand?
Artemus, you ready for this?  His next target is Albuquerque.
We've got to stop him right here, now!  With that armored steam engine of his it'll be a slaughter.
My hat is off to you, sir.
My God!  He's so excessive!
Artemus!  Look at that.  Brand spanking new.  She's a beauty, huh?  Let's get rolling.
You didn't tell us you had this on!
He's not giving up?
My name's Tyler.  Frank Tyler. Pleased to meet you, ma'am.
Doyle's the name, sir.  Of the Connemara Doyles.  And there's not a man riding the rails who holds a candle to meself.  That having been said, sir, you're five minutes late so let's be on our way!  Your friend's already aboard.
Listen, in two days I'm embarking on a tour of the western territories.  And I want to know at least one problem is being handled competently in my absence.
But what would anyone have to gain from all this...?  Unless it were a foreign power.
... well, of course you can.  Mr. President, what a surprise.  What brings you here?
Where'd he say he was going to do this?
Still alive.  Hmm.  I suppose that doesn't bode well for poor Bruno.
Because I am holding all the western territories hostage, Mr. West!  A town a day will disappear!  Willard was merely a test run, a stroll in the park.  Next, I level all of Albuquerque!  Yes, that's right.  Only yesterday I learned what you undoubtedly already know: your own President will be there.  What an added bonus! The gods are shining on me!  After tomorrow every American citizen will rise up and demand I be given back my humble little empire!
I only met him once, but that was enough.  For such a little man he had quite an oversized opinion of himself.  He offered me the "rare and unparalleled opportunity" to develop a new steam engine for him.  He claims to have some sort of factory in Texas, I believe. Said I could have the run of the place.  He had all sorts of specifications.  But when I questioned him closely, it became obvious he was just another mercenary businessman.  Both he and his partner had no real love of steam.  It's sad.  So few men do.
A Southern gentlemen.  I don't recall his name.  I suppose it's unkind of me to say it, but he had the most disconcerting glass eye.
When are they coming?
Well, come on, that's half a dozen armed men...
We're going into battle, little one.  Find a woman to take care of it.
You left me to die, friend.
You gonna be a hero, Madmartigan? I've lost half my men fighting Kael, and Bavmorda, and the Nock- maar army.  Now you and this Peck, and that magpie up in the rafters, are gonna take 'em on alone?
You are very important, Willow.
Sir!  I have to talk to you.
Now, you know where you're going?  Down there, through those trees, follow the river.  You'll know the crossroads by a big daikini struc- ture.  Willow, this is serious business.  Don't waste any time, the outer world is no place for a Nelwyn.  Give the baby to the first daikini you see, then hurry home as fast as you can.
Because it's true.
Sorsha.
We're a tiny version of all that?
Thanks for your help, Peck.
You all right?
Whatcha thinkin' about, Willow?
You gotta promise to feed her.
Time to change her diaper.
Because she's sick.
When I left the crossroads, I got ambushed by an elf!
So you're on your way to Tir Asleen, huh?  I hate to tell you this, Willow, but Tir Asleen dosn't exist.
Madmartigan, I need your help.
She asked about you, Madmartigan.
I don't know, Willow.
Dada, what's a daikini?
I could be you rguard!  I could carry your spear!
You must learn magic.
I know, and the magician's goal is to find his true self.  But what's this got to do with it?
I'm all finished.  Now what?
But what am I gonna transform??
Again:  what is the magician's weapon?
I did it!  Madmartigan!  Come here! Look!  You gotta see this!  I did it!
I've come all this way and now Elora Dana's going to die!
Time is running out.
We gotta follow them.
Get back here, Rool!
Madmartigan.
I'm getting her out of there!
Ohhh, I hate this.
This is not going well.
Its branches are supposed to be made of gold, solid gold.
We've traveled a long way.  We're looking for Fin Raziel.
Sure, I'm sorry. Hope you don't mind me plugging in to your battery. Mine's dead... How can I help? What can I do?
Eat up, Book. What's the matter with your appetite?
How could you do this to me tonight? I told you I had company
Where's Timmy and Buck?
Nail it!
I saw him.
Who'd you see, Sam? The man on the floor?
That's Luke. He doesn't like strangers.
Are you really ever coming back?
That's the problem. We need results. The press is driving us crazy over this P2P thing. Calling us the 'speed capitol of the country'. You know the sort of thing. It's getting political. The Commissioner's getting very uneasy.
What's-her-name moved to Buffalo.
Last guy I would have figured. But he's part of it.
Who else knows?
I'm a police officer. I'm going to have to talk to the boy. What's his name?
Now what's the problem?
But not a good tired.
Why don't you arrest that man? Are you protecting him because policeman?
But why?
Enjoying your reading?
Buttons are Hochmut.
Vain. Proud. Such a person is Hochmutsnarr. He is not plain.
You make fun of me. Like the tourists. Driving by all the time. Some even come into the yard. Very rude. They seem to think we are quaint.
But Stoltzfus said...
Eli is a fine carpenter. Best in the district. He and his father built the big house themselves forty years ago.
When will you be going?
I want you to take this... to remember by.
Listen carefully, I wrote the Amish woman's name and address on my desk calendar, I want you to lose it for me, Now. Tonight.
You know where he is.
Elaine, I've come to apologize for Lt. McElroy. He overstated the department's position.
Everything okay?
I wanted to. you were kind to take us in last night.  Anyway, I needed something to do. I was so angry with your brother. He's so... agaanisish!
No? Why not?
Who was that man?
I am not a child.
I will be the judge of that.
She say where he is?
No, you listen. Get out!
Just listen to what Miss Gulch did to Toto! She --
Seventy --  Dorothy, please!
But I did leave you, Uncle Henry -- that's just the trouble.  And I tried to get back for days and days.
To see?
Then this is a day of Independence For all the Munchkins and their descendants!
From now on you'll be history
Oh, come on - come on! We'll soon find the Wizard!
If you were really great and powerful, you'd keep your promises!
Uhhhh -- yes...
Oh!  Come back!  Don't go without me! Please come back!
Oh! Oh, it feels like my joints are rusted. Listen, Dorothy, don't let Hunk kid you about Miss Gulch. She's just a poor sour-faced old maid that -- she ain't got no heart left. You know, you should have a little more heart yourself, and have pity on her.
I thought you said she was dead.
Are you ready now?
Yes, I'm ready now.
Oh, yes - you - you wanted to go home, huh?
That's right.  What's she doing?
That dog's a menace to the community.  I'm taking him to the sheriff and make sure he's destroyed.
Oil can.....Oil can....
...m...m...my, my, my, my goodness -- I can talk again! Oh -- oil my arms, please -- oil my elbows.
Oh --
And I was standing over there rusting for the longest time.
And bears!
Can't that female take no for an answer?
Now I know I've got a heart -- 'cause it's breaking.
Oh, my!
Well, of course not.  My goodness, what a fuss you're making.  Well, naturally, when you go around picking on things weaker than you are -- Why, you're nothing but a great big coward!
Oh -- unusual weather we're having, ain't it?
I'll be home in time for supper!
I'd sooner wait outside.
That noise don't come from no ordinary bird.
As Monarch of the Forest I don't like the situation.
Now lookit, Dorothy, you ain't using your head about Miss Gulch.  Think you didn't have any brains at all.
Well, why don't you use them?  When you come home, don't go by Miss Gulch's place.  Then Toto won't get in her garden, and you won't get in no trouble.  See?
Oh, no -- I just keep picking it up and putting it back in again.
Wonderful!  Why, if our Scarecrow back in Kansas could do that, the crows'd be scared to pieces!
That's where I live.  And I want to get back there so badly I'm going all the way to Emerald City to get the Wizard of Oz to help me.
I couldn't say.  But even if he didn't, you'd be no worse off than you are now.
Hooray!  I guess that did it!  Help yourself.
Oil can what?
...just that the Witch is so wicked. I don't think you two ought to come with me because you'll get into trouble.
Oh, you're the best friends anybody ever had!  And it's funny, but I feel as if I've known you all the time.  But I couldn't have, could I?
Yes -- there --
Oh --
No -- No -- No -- No!
...ting the ruby slippers?
The ruby slippers!  What have you done with them? Give them back to me, or I'll ---
What if it were a brontosaurus?
They sure knocked the stuffings out of you, didn't they?
Yes, you.
That's right.
Stop pushing!
Where -- where do we go now?
What's that? What's that? Take it away - take it away - Take it away! 
It's a whatzis.
...I -- I -- I hope my strength holds out.
No?  Now, wait a minute.
You don't get around us that easy!
What's she done?  I'm all but lame from the bite on my leg!
To Oz?
Oh - oh, poor Dorothy!
Let's.
It's a whozis.
Uh - now, please don't be angry with me. I'll - I'll do anything you say, only... only if you don't shout at me. It makes me nervous!
As for you, my galvanized friend, you want a heart! You don't know how lucky you are not to have one. Hearts will never be practical until they can be made unbreakable. I could have been a world figure, a power among men, a - a successful wizard, had I not been obstructed by a heart.
-- Ruined my exit!
Shame you had to spot I wasn’t the real thing.
Elektra King?  Are you insane?  This is her pipeline.
He’s sealed himself in.
I love Christmas in Turkey.
Get out to the pipeline. Find the insider who switched the pin. If your instincts are right, Renard will be back. He hasn’t completed the job. The pipeline is still going forward, and we have Elektra to thank for that.
In case you’ve forgotten.  I’m dead already.
Today, of all days, the sun decides to shine.
Does this look familiar to you?
Are you trying to break my heart? Or is it just your way with women?
No!  It will cave in!
What is it?
How did you survive?
How dare you!  How dare you! That animal!?  That monster!? He disgusts me! You disgust me!  So he knew where to hurt you, is that it? You had a sling on your arm at the funeral! I didn’t have to sleep with you to find that out.
So you killed your father.
See?  You’re upsetting my customers. What do you want?
That is 5,000 dollars of Beluga ruined!
Mother of God.
Perhaps this isn’t the time...
Now you know how it feels.  To be locked away, to wonder if they’re coming for you, if anyone will ever come for you.
The parcel’s in the post.
Any word from him?
No idea who's behind this?
There's no right or wrong.  But if you don't give me an honest response, I can't help you.  I want to help you.  I want to know all about you.
Walter.  This compulsion of yours -- to punish transgressors.  In your mind . . . what gives you the right to judge?
Hi, Jon.
The bearer of bad news.
Rorschach's on the case.  He's got Dreiberg in a lather.  He seems to think that someone is "stalking" the Watchmen.
I could stay and go.
Jon, does anybody know what the hell you're talking about?  Dan's just an ordinary guy, but he talks to me.  When he looks at me he's seeing something more than just a -- a collection of atoms.
Jon -- there's something I have to know.  Did you love me once?
Then why don't you . . . do something about it!
I can't stand any more of this.  I want to go back.  If I'm going to die I want to be with -- other people.
It's -- he's got some kind of conspiracy theory.  He thinks someone's . . . I don't know, stalking us.
They're not following me, Dan.  I mean -- Jon's gone, we're right on the brink of World War III.  Nobody cares about the Watchmen.
His what?
Old?
Eight cops?  Oh, great.  A jury's gonna love that.
-- What is it.
I beg your pardon . . . ?  Some gratitude.
Welcome back, Night Owl.
What was he doing?
. . . That was quick.
I don't know if you heard.  A hired gunman tried to off Adrian.
Where's Laurie?
What caused it?
Adrian.  What are you doing?  Why wouldn't you let us in?
I can fix it.
No.  No.  Cut.  -- Justine, we agreed.  No questions about the Watchmen.
I did not.  Now get out of my way!
You're lying, Miss Juspeczyk.
Adrian!  Don't leave so soon.  I --
Laurie -- he's the most powerful man who's ever lived.  He's changed the world.
I don't know who you are buddy, but I swear to God, you got the wrong guy.
CTU?  Jesus.  You don't think --
New information.
Too important for telephone.  Comedian -- Dr. Manhattan.  All linked up.
Most guys we ran through this either took off or helped them rob the place. I expected you to do the same.
Alright, Cage, you've got me. This is one of those moments. "Many are called, few are chosen", that kind of thing. Your government needs you. Are you up for the challenge?
You've really got me confused, Cage. On the one hand you showed leadership, courage under fire, a willingness to protect men you hardly knew... and on the other you have an arrest record that pegs you as near sociopathic. Help me out here. I'm not following your evolution.
You're perceptive too. I forgot to add that to the list of surprises. I'm with the National Security Agency. And unlikely as it may sound, I need your help.
Now I'm the one who's nauseous. So what's the deal? What do you need me for?
What do I get out of it?
Not bad for a gimp.
Buddy, you sent me here to get close to their organization, that costs money.
They retrofitted Ahab with some kind of rocket launcher. They were loading canisters of liquid into it, light colored and dark colored in the same tube but separate. Something tells me this it that "classified" stuff you didn't want me to know about. Does the song "Silent Night" mean anything to you?
Kinda funny, though, isn't it? We're not supposed to be making weapons like that anyway. Guess we shoulda played by the rules.
You've kept up your end of the bargain, I'll do the same. But you really should consider staying on, you make a decent agent.
You know what they say, the only way to change the system is from the inside.
On come on, X. Did you really think we were that barbaric?
Whatchu doing here?
What game is that?
Just about anything I want, it looks like. This is gonna be tough, though. There's no way to save this game. I gotta get it right the first time through.
If you got a problem with me, why are we dancing?
Where are you going?
I was invited. What's your story?
Bullshit. I see you look at everything, study everything, ask questions. I know exactly what you're doing. Empty your pockets.
So why don't you tell me something about who you gather information for. They obviously have very deep pockets. Are you from a rival clan?
Whoever sent you knew what they were doing. You and Yorgi are practically twins. Two nihilistic fashion victims who make a lot of noise but don't say much.
Don't even start. I'll be honest, I don't trust you. Bur lets pretend for a minute that what you say is true, that I want to leave. What can you do about it?
There's no more time for games. They made you. There's a sniper out front waiting to put a bullet in your eye. Tell me if it's true.
I was supposed to wait for the cop to kill you and then kill the cop. They'll believe me.  I've been lying for so long, one more time won't hurt.
Nothing. He had two days.
What was that for?
Miniature power cams set in on contact, giving you a sure grip on any surface.
From the Beastie Boys collection?
I can see that. Why?
Sit down.
That's the guy.
Cops. Like a plague. No matter how many you pay there's always another with his hand out. How did you pick him out?
Thanks, but I'm here on business. I heard you're the G around here. I'm looking for some cars, expensive ones. A lot of them.
We seen all your shit! So you want cars? We get whatever cars you need. What are you looking for?
I had to inspect the merchandise first.
I don't believe it! You can't shoot a cop in the middle of the street!
You got it, man. It's stupid but it's true. True freedom is when you do whatever you want anytime you want. That's when you know you're living, man.
Hell no. My dad was a straight up tin soldier. Somehow he pissed this general off and got himself dishonorably discharged. Had a court martial and everything. The charges were total bullshit, so he was sure he'd get his name cleared, but it didn't happen.
I've got meetings this afternoon, I've got to get some sleep. Just pick a girl.
So all by yourself, you're going to destroy every government; in the world.
Thomas Edison knew how to make the light bulb.  He had the energy source. He had the vacuum.  But he didn't have the filament.  He tried metal after metal but nothing would hold to power.
Radar Stealth Mode checks out.  All right, there'll be less security north of the George Washington Bridge.  I'm taking her down.
Jean... can you?
I've served with men like you before. Methodical.  Systematic -- Naive.  You know what happens to those men in a real fight?
There's no smoking or drinking on the school grounds.
If necessary.
The mutant gene tells the body when it needs to change.
Come with me and I'll let her live.
I've found her, Westchester Mall.
The two in Alaska.  Just how do you people manage to be in the right place at the right time?  Still tinkering with Cerebro?
Is that so?
This checkmate goes to you.  I didn't want to hurt anyone.  But you leave me no choice.
Oh, shit.
They say, also, that you have recreated the horrible monster who, for so many years, has haunted and terrorized the God-fearing people of this village.  What say you to that?
Yes, sir, he was.  But he said he was obligated to lecture at Johns Hopkins University.
Herr Falkstein! You have your instructions!
You're incorrigible!... Aren't you?
So this is what it's like to be completely happy!
Darling!...you will be careful!?
Mother's going to help me with the invitations.
Ready, darling?
I suppose you're right.
I hope you find this comfortable. This was Baron Victor's room.
There seem to be quite a few books.
I don't think so.  Is my assistant taken care of?
Well... if you're sure that I could accomplish everything in a week... I suppose I could manage it.
What?
I didn't do that.
Not at all -- a great privilege, Doctor.
Isn't it true that Darwin preserved a piece of vermicelli in a glass case until, by some extraordinary means, it actually began to move with voluntary motion?
Yes, but, sir... if it could be accomplished, wouldn't that eliminate disease from the human frame and render man invulnerable to any but a violent death?
But look at what's been done with hearts and kidneys!
Yes, that's right.  My grandfather and your grandfather used to pal around together.  You and I should have a lot of laughs.
There.
I want that brain.
Oh, do you like it?  I'm not partial to desserts, but this is excellent.
To you!  You just made a 'yummy' sound, so I thought you liked the dessert.
No, no!  That whole thing!
I'm a failure.
No!  The only hope now is to get him back here.  If I can just find a way to relieve the pressure on his cerebellum...
There's only one way.
Come on, big fellow!
How's everything?
Poo -- tmmm anngh ma Ritz!
Extremely well.
Could I lie down in your bed for a little while?  I just can't sleep.
Oh please -- just till I get sleepy. Then you can force me right back to my room.
Inga!
Let me come with you, Doctor, please!  I don't want to stay up here alone.
Oh, doctor!
Do you think you can sing it?
Did you do it?
Good night, Doctor.
Oh, a little.  But it's not just physical loneliness.  It's the pangs that come from missing someone intellectually... as I have you.
What?
And Elizabeth has hers.
MMMMmmmmm!
Ready for Fuchsmachen???
I think the doctor is a genius! Don't you, Igor?

GRRRHMMNNNJKJMMMNN!
You afeared of the Zulus then, Quartermaster?
Do not confuse yourse{fi Why? We must strike a heavy blow. This cannot be a war of manoeuvre.
Splendid site, Crealock, splendil I want to establish Camp here immediately.
Colonel Durnford... William Vereker. I hear you 've been seeking Officers?
