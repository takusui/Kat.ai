Forget it.
Unsolved mystery.  She used to be really popular when she started high school, then it was just like she got sick of it or something.
I really, really, really wanna go, but I can't.  Not unless my sister goes.
Who knows?  All I've ever heard her say is that she'd dip before dating a guy that smokes.
What crap?
Would you mind getting me a drink, Cameron?
Is he oily or dry?
Sometimes I wonder if the guys we're supposed to want to go out with are the ones we actually want to go out with, you know?
I don't have to be home 'til two.
Hopefully.
Queen Harry?
Nowhere... Hi, Daddy.
What?
But you hate Joey
What? To completely damage me?  To send me to therapy forever? What?
Perm?
And where're you going?
If Kat's not going, you're not going.
It's just a party. Daddy.
So they tell me...
Bianca Stratford.  Sophomore. Don't even think about it
I could start with your haircut, but it doesn't matter.  She's not allowed to date until her older sister does.  And that's an impossibility.
You mean I'd get a chance to talk to her?
Forget his reputation.  Do you think we've got a plan or not?
Okay!  I wasn't sure
It's her favorite band.
She kissed me.
Fine, thirty.
Fifty, and you've got your man.
Are you lost?
We don't chat.
Block E?
An attempted slit.
No fear.
I didn't have a choice.
I did Bianca a favor and it backfired.
Oh, good.  Something new and different for us.
Sweating like a pig, actually.  And yourself?
I was in the laundromat. I saw your car. Thought I'd say hi.
I know, just let me sleep
Leave it to you to use big words when you're shitfaced.
I hate him.
Hey man. . .  You don ' t think I can be "cool"?  You don't think I can be "laid back" like everyone else?
Then why'd you ask?
He just wants me to be someone I'm not.
Don't for one minute think that you had any effect whatsoever on my panties.
I hate peas.
No one else knows
So I have to have a motive to be with you?
You need therapy.  Has anyone ever told you that?
Nothing!  There's nothing in it for me. Just the pleasure of your company.
Oh huh
You were paid to take me out!  By -- the one person I truly hate.  I knew it was a set-up!
Don ' t you even dare. . .
Enough!
Because you're making decisions for me.
I want to go to an East Coast school! I want you to trust me to make my own choices.  I want --
No, Daddy.
The part where Bianca beat the hell out of some guy.
When I go?
No ... I believe "heinous bitch" is the term used most often.
The situation is, my man Cameron here has a major jones for Bianca Stratford.
We're your guys.
Just for now.
It says here you exposed yourself to a group of freshmen girls.
Sarah Lawrence is on the other side of the country.
Tumescent!
Kissing?  Is that what you think happens?  Kissing isn't what keeps me up to my elbows in placenta all day.
Dr. Ruth?
The water's going putrid in the barrels.
Yes, your Eminence.  The voyage should not take more than six or seven weeks.
Your life, and that of others!
Is that all that interests you? Gold?
IF-GOD-WILLS-IT!
On the contrary, Your Eminence.  It seems to me the man is preparing his own cross.
What a tragedy... what a waste of a life...
I know.
I don't want you to wait for me.
I am busy inside.
I can't keep my eyes off you.  I would like to catch up with all the moments I didn't spend with you.
Forgive me, Don Bobadilla -- those positions have already been taken.
Call them.
Look out of that window.
With some difficulty.  I had to promise them you were not a total fool.
I've been contradicted all my life... Eternity!
Colon!  Don't!
I am not sure... It could be twice the distance.
You are bound by an oath, Father.
A woman?
Savagery is what monkeys understand.
God be with us admiral.
Twenty eight.
He's drawing an isthmus... He's saying we're on an isthmus.
We have to keep the hopes of these men alive!
You never did.  You did all the talking for both of us, remember?
Emil.  Take it easy.  Stay with me.  Sit down.  What do you need?  What are you looking for?
Where are we going?
You bring the cigarettes?
Yeah, yeah...bad doctor gave her bad drugs which made her go blind.  And my father blamed me for her blindness...
I don't think it's abuse, I think it's torture.
No.
So you were never a prostitute?
I'm just trying to find out who you are.
I know.
Ludwig?  He's gay - are you jealous?
No matter what happens...I'm glad I met you.
Right.
In the kitchen.
You're a cop - you'll never believe me.
Who do you think, Chief?!
I came to see how the investigation was going.  I called and you're not here.  I wait up at the station and you don't even show up!!!  I beep you - you don't return my call.  Where the hell have you been?!
Chief - I know I screwed up - but this guy was no innocent civilian.
Yeah.  He finished awhile ago.
You ready?
Yeah.
Police.  We'd like to ask you a few questions.
No, what is it?
Eastern Europe.  Like what?  Romania? Hungary?
There wasn't a fire.  There'll be nothing for you to do.
This isn't homicide school.
Stay here.
This has nothing to do with your fire.
I'll call it... tails.
Of course.
She just saw two of her friends killed! They probably threatened her.
Raw deal.
Just a shower?
Well, it's not up to you to decide whether she's innocent or not.  Don't you understand, that's why you're a professional.
What do you want?
What's your accomplishment.
If you kill me and film it you're putting a noose around your neck.
Smarter than Americans.  You're fed cry baby talk shows all day long.  Not only will Americans believe me, they'll cry for me.  So...Detective Eddie Flemming, would you like to say goodbye to your Nicolette? Maybe you can propose to her now?
You know you can't do that.  C'mon.
Um...now is not a good time, okay. Detective Jackson's hurt.  He's fine. I've got a Fire Marshall shot, Detective Jackson is hurt but not seriously.
Alright.
Maybe I should just, ya know...turn to the cameras and say, do you mind if we just work something out?
I'm not.
Answer it.
I'll tell you tonight.  Let's do it tonight.  As soon as you get back we'll talk.  We'll talk.
Patronizing you... Nay, I love you.
Jesus Christ.
Not what.  Who.
You're worried for my safety.  I'm touched.
No.  Are you proposing?
Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.
You'll be my first.
I ordered a Czech girl.  Daphne, you know her?
New York's finest.  This is his case.
Do you know how much killer gets for movie rights?
I want to document my trip to America.
Don't speak Russian!
Smell like chemicals...for smoking drugs.
You said speak Czech!
Good idea!
Shut up.  Look!
Credit?
No, I don't get that!
Ha. Ha.
What are you doing here?
If I didn't put it on somebody else would!  I was his friend!
What are you coming here to do?
Look, I don't have time for you, get out of my way!!
Fire Department?  Firemen don't carry guns.
Hey.  C'mon, you can't leave me like this.  Some freak'll come by and stab me!
A dog pissed on me!!  I'm gonna sue you for this!  You violated my civil rights!
Yeah, I'm religious.  I'm not an Atheist like you!  Now, are you guys gonna arrest me, or not?
I used an accelerant.
I heard.  Who the hell let them up there?
What the hell happened?
Don't you get it?  He knew he was gonna get caught!  That's why he videotaped Eddie's murder - he thinks he's gonna get off.
I'm afraid I've only got a few minutes, but I'd love to.
Well, I suppose they've been having a bit of trouble with some of the equipment.
It's possible.
I don't think we should make any fuss about it yet. I'm sure they'll straighten it out.
I suppose so. Though, of course, there's a more sinister explanation.
I guess it isn't.
Well... Hal's reported the AO-unit about to fail again.
No.
Yes.
I'm sorry about the misunderstanding, Hal.
And don't you worry about it.
It doesn't have to be, Hal. It's more dangerous to be out of touch with Earth. Let me have manual control, please.
Well, what is it?
Well, the only important aspect of the mission are: where are we going, what will we do when we get there, when are we coming back, and... why are we going?
Yes, I know that sweetheart.
No, I'm sorry, darling, I told you I won't be home for a few days.
Thank you.
I suppose it was bound to happen sooner or later.
Well, that does sound very odd.
Yes, very pleasant.
Fine.
I suppose you saw the work on our new section while you were docking.
Are you quite sure?
Are you, by any chance, going up to your base at Clavius?
Well, it's just for the past two weeks there have been some extremely odd things happening at Clavius.
Yes. Well, for one thing, whenever you phone the base, all you can get is a recording which repeats that the phone lines are temporarily out of order.
You mean you haven't been able to get anyone at the base for ten days?
Well, I'm glad about that.
How can you tell it was deliberately buried?
Well, not really. At first glance, black would suggest something sun-powered, but then why would anyone deliberately bury a sun- powered device?
I don't think it has, but I'd like to check that. Simpson, what's the log on that?
I take it this is something to do with the trouble they're having up at Clavius?
No, of course, Captain, I can understand your concern.
Not really, Frank. I think there may be a flaw in the assembly procedure.
Great, just great.
Vodka.
Whaddya mean, buy?
He's just kiddin', you just keep doin' what I tell ya, you'll be okay.
And I need one more for my pal. Yeah. Make her an Indian. No, not a turban, you know, a squaw.
Oh ... You're a schoolteacher...
I can deliver Ganz.  But you gotta get me outta here first.
I got a lot to protect.
You just don't get it, do your Reggie?  There isn't any deal. I own your ass.
What gang you talkin' about, Jack?
Then what're you complainin' about? At least nobody's calling you shithead....
Your pal nuts enough to take a shot at me?
Thank you.
I think you better put him on ice, man.
Mission District.  Gonna find us an Indian.
You have a good time?
While you're at it, You can give me the switchblade, too.
You wanna leave, man?  Let me take care of Ganz all by myself.
I'm impressed with you too, Jack you did a real good job of busting up a couple of dykes bedded down for the night.
Depends on how things work out. I believe in the merit system. So far you haven't built up any points.
You're a real case, you know that, Jack?
Not really.  I figured Ganz was put down for a long time.  And I knew Luther would never job me on his own.  He's too chickenshit.
Didn't know you darker people went in for foreign jobs.
I'm not in this 'cause it's fun. I'm not into hitting guys 'cause it makes me feel good either... I do it 'cause it works-...
Be polite. Say hello.  This is Candy.
You missed ... Luther took a taxi to the hotel across the street. Made a phone call.
Forget it. I want Ganz as bad as you do and I got some other news for you...
When you been in prison three years, it don't take long. Let's go.
Yeah. It missed the last four stops.
I had it impounded.  Come on, we'll use it for haulin' you back to the slam.
There's nothin' to talk about.
No trouble, Jack. But, listen, suppose I stay a crook?  Where'd you get the idea that you could catch me?
Jack, come on, there is an official department policy about cop killings. Cop killers represent a special priority because any man crazy enough to kill a cop is a greater threat to an unarmed civilian... In other words, we can't seen like we're in the revenge business... I know, we all know the truth's a little different.
You might be more of a team player and a little less of a hot dog on this one, Jack.
Yeah.
Uhh ... Wong, Henry Wong.  He was in on the same job.
Nothing came in for me yet?  No calls?
Okay.  See you in the morning... you know, you ought to get some rest...
What?
I think I met her.  Now tell us something we don't know, like where they stashed her.
What'd you do?
I guess he got the message...
Jack, are you okay?
Bullshit?  I'll tell you about bullshit.  My gun's a real weapon in the hands of a real maniac who knows how to use it.  It isn't my macho bullshit that's killing people, my gun is ...
I didn't get burned, two cops did. Listen, I'll tell you about personnel responsibility.  I like to get the job done right.  And if I don't get my job done right... I'm for shit.
That's right.  I'm not like you. I'm not gonna sit on my ass wondering what's right and what's wrong... There's a psycho out there killing people with my gun and I'm gonna get him.  Because it's my job. And if you don't get that...
This is not the way people who care for each other are supposed to behave.
Elaine! I... I'm sorry... I was expecting somebody else... police business.
Jack, wait...
I've been better...Dead end.  No Ganz, no Indian.
Jack, it's all over the papers. He's an obvious type.  But this Indian...
So what?
Usual bullshit.  You make one smart move and everybody wants to be your friend... You know somethin', shootin' guys sucks. Especially compared to this.
Where is he?
In all due respect, he sounds kind of pathetic to me.  The kind of guy that runs home to his momma or some girlfriend.  Have you two ace detectives checked that out?
Hot?  Hey, they're not even room temperature.
It's loaded... I got some shells in here.
Corn-i-Lius?
...Why on earth do the stones interest you?
You noticed...
So you do know her.
Dallas. Korben Dallas.
I might call to check up on her, you know... to see if she's better?
I know. I was there when she arrived.
When is she not in trouble?
That's what I'm saying.
And then?
Yes. Of course..
They are... with me...
Hey bud! Finger here.
Don't exist bud.
How do I look?
Hey bud...I'm waiting all day here.
Leeloo..
...'Scuse me?
You're not that bad... Come on we'll get you to a doctor.
Take them and put them in a safe place.
Don't you ever ask me for another thing in my life again, you've killed your poor mother with your own hands!
How you doing this morning?  Sleep OK? I didn't.
Anyone know how to release the lines on this crate?
He's on vacation.
I'll be right back.
What mission?
Just one... why me?
All 900.
...The rain falls...
I'm so tired...
You're right but there are lots of good things... beautiful things...
Yes, you do! I need you. More than you can imagine! Stand up straight!
Because...
I love you...
I've never gotten a message that wasn't bad news.
You're welcome..
Wonderful!
There are no results from the chemical and molecular analysis as of yet, all the calibers are overshot..we're hoping a thermo nucleatic imaging..
I'm about to, Mr. President.
"..in which all the history of the Universe resides ..all the strength..all the hope..Protect us from Evil.."
To fame.. salud..
Amy, it's me.  Listen very carefully..
I can't tell you, Amy.  You know I can't.  You have to trust me...
I don't know what to say
Amy...
She's all I've got.  She's the only witness.
Mixed hard bondage.  Rape films. Sick shit.  Buy five, get one free.
There ain't no such thing as snuff. Why don't you fuck off?
I just got a call... two seconds ago, some motherfucker called... says he knows about the loop.
I'm telling you...
I promised him to Machine.
I'll consider it.
Machine.
I'm camera shy.
Look, he's got nothing to do with this... let him go...
We do.
What do you want?
I told you, I don't know.
Yeah, the fucking lawyer.
Tell me what happened.
Where?  Show me where.
Get together some upscale product where the girls still have teeth in their head.  Till then, fuck you.
Of what sort?
Never mind how I found you.
Just tell me.  Tell me some more of the secrets you and Christian shared. What kind of degenerate pervert was he really?  What the fuck did he want with a snuff film?
I'm asking.
Enlighten me.
Well, it's tempting, but no thanks.
Catchy title.  What are you really reading?  Hard to believe that book's got any parts worth highlighting.
Might get drummed out of the pornographer's union, and then where would I be?
I'm a working stiff, pops.
You want me to come out there and play private eye?
I told you, he's one of Dino Velvet's stock players...
Nobody knows his name.  That's his thing.  He always wears a mask.  You never see his face.  He calls himself "Machine," that's what they call him.  Machine.
What kind of Junior P.I. would I be if I didn't go with you?
I'm afraid I don't...
You've found missing persons before.
The checks were for odd amounts...
I hope it's nothing serious.
How will I get it to you?
They hired you.  You're like, a private detective?
You probably expect me to be wearing a trench coat and a hat.  Drinking whiskey, chasing women and getting beaten up by guys with broken noses. Want to know what it's really like? It's sitting in a car and staring at a hotel window for three days straight, pissing in a plastic bottle, pardon me, because some guy thinks his wife's cheating on him. Glamorous, huh?  And the guy who hired you, he has a hair-lip, dandruff and crooked teeth, and you could have told him the minute you laid eyes on him his wife's cheating, and you don't blame her.
I don't know.
No.
Who is this... ?
No...
No... no... no...
She was the kindest, sweetest girl you'd ever want to meet.  Oh, I adored her.  I supposed I always hoped she'd be back.  After a time, all I could do was pray she had moved on to better things.  Can you get this suitcase to her parents, if you think it's appropriate?
Kristen...
Have you seen Joey and Kincaid!  God, I can't find them.  I can't find them anywhere.
How'd you learn so much about dreams?
You'll hear all kinds of stories. They'll tell you it was murder, but it wasn't.
Extra money, huh?
Why can't we just talk to the authorities?
You know, I get the weirdest feeling we've been through this before.
Debbie.  She's gone.  I've...collected her, like the others.
Save it for later.  Come on!
Well Mom, I'll tell ya, when two of your friends die the same day, you let me know what it does to your appetite.
Your distraught.  It'll help...
Avoid-all-contact-day.
How did you know that?
Been having bad dreams.
She doesn't want me around
Come on downstairs.  He won't hurt you. He needs us both.
No.  Well, not exactly...it's that...I felt like I wasn't in control.  For the first time since...all that.  I'm scared.
No.  A deal's a deal.
Sobering...
Had kind of a long night.
Yeah, before they revoke his diploma.
What do you think I'm doing?  Look.  Whether you believe it or not, Krueger is back.  He's after the baby and if I don't try to do something about it, who will??
We've got to go to the asylum and find her body.  Mark said her soul's trapped with it -- that's why she can't come to me.  It must be!
That's okay.  He's got the rest of his life to catch up on his sleep.
Nobody thinks that.
It wasn't her mother.  The only reason we're still here is that none of us has slept since the grad party.
Why don't I go make some coffee.  There's a lot to tell.
Who?
I don't believe this... All that gore you paint in the comics and you're squeamish?
I can't listen to this.
It was moderate.  He'll be all right.  But it was out of the question, his coming along.
Not in two days.  Look:  Do you think I <u>wanted</u> to come?  If it didn't mean so much to Dad - proving his depth-explorer - it's the last thing I'd want!
Your father can be in Nome, Alaska, tomorrow.  We have two choices: Ask them to send him out in a 'copter', and take you off, or the Shark can put back into Nome...
<u>You</u> said it.  But I won't argue -
We're <u>all</u> risking our lives!
You may not <u>win</u> them.  But without men like your father, to 'degrade' himself by fighting to preserve them - or as much as we have of them - they'd have disappeared, <u>long</u> ago!
Then...this is a 'flying saucer?'
I'd sooner swim!
So?
Not <u>alone</u>, you're not!
Strange you didn't hear it. OMIT 274F
You know - it <u>is</u>?
Somewhere down there?
What's goin' on in here, Lad? What - ?
Right, Skipper.
What???
Right at our one-eyed friend!
Something wrong?
What direction does the system indicate?
After torpedo room:  Report!
It's the screws, Skipper.  At our declination angle, running in reverse, they're pulling the Shark <u>and</u> Cyclops right to the bottom.
Point of view is everything. To us, <u>your</u> form of life is ugly as we appear to you.
The pattern.  Each incident occurred almost precisely a thousand statute miles from the Pole.  A line through the points of occurrence makes almost a complete circle...
But <u>answers</u> are what we need - not more questions!
Yeah, sure. Why? I got this damned tooth, I got a few things bugging me, like everybody else. But I'm okay.
Alma, I think there's some dirty business going on in this town.
Yeah. I know about that.
Good. It would help if there were some drug or alcohol abuse on the part of your ex-wife. Sexual problems upsetting to the child.
Lawyer? I don't need no lawyer, do I?
Yep. Right about now the does are holing up in the brush piles. The bucks are right behind them and we're right behind the bucks.  This gun gets fired before ten o'clock. Whether it kills a deer or not is more less up to you. I'll put you inside 30, 35 yards of a buck the first four hours of the season. That's what you're paying me for, ain't it?
Yeah.
Got you for -- 450, 500 bucks? 
Right!
Shit.
Let's get the fuck outta here. You're not making any sense, man.
Yeah.
He sure as hell won't.
Why don't you quit now, you want out so bad?
I guess they're stupid.
It's not funny now. I'm a cop and I gotta listen to all the complaints people make. I'm not a kid anymore. You change.
No. I didn't used to be bad. No sir. Where do you get this stuff? From your mother?
It's stupid.
No.
Yes.
See, I knew you'd be mad.
It belongs to Pop.
Okay.
Nope. Not anymore. I'm nothing anymore.
At the school crossing. In his BMW. Coulda hurt some kids. I'm gonna bust his ass.
What am I -- a security guard? You hired me, you and your Selectman friends.
Twombley's shot. I heard that. Not Jack. He's okay, I assume.
You want me to follow them to Littleton?
I'm fine, fine.
Elaine! Call Chub Meritt and have him pick up Wade's car, fix the clutch.
Wade, that wasn't smart. Going out right after the man's father-in-law shot himself. Let it go. Call it a favor to me.
Mel's doing some business with me. It's nice to do favors for people you do business with. He was in a hurry. No big deal.
Yeah.
You know what I'm talking about. For what you're doing to me and to the child you say you love so much. Love. You won't get away with it.
Did you see that sonofabitch in the BMW? He could've killed somebody.
I know who it is.
Mel Gordon.
Yeah.
Yeah.
The hell she isn't. Lillian's been trying to nail me to a cross since the day I met her. I'm gonna hire me a fucking lawyer from Concord and get this thing, this divorce thing, rearranged. I've been thinking about it a lot. It's like she owns Jill or something. Nobody owns nobody, especially not kids. And I pay her.
There's something funny about that shooting. There's lots funny about it, actually.
I'm sure, I'm positive it didn't happen the way Jack says it did.
What way?
Think they're alright?
Wade.
Don't give me a hard time, Mr. Gordon. I'm just --
Oh, no. No, it's a... it's a traffic thing. No big deal.
This town sucks.
Atta-go.
She's coming.
Wade. I thought she was alright. Till this morning she was.
You think you can take me now? Come on, try.
You don't know me. You don't know me!  So fuck you. Fuck you.
Bang!
Crawl!
He was scheduled to testify for a committee investigating organized crime in New England and the construction business.
Twombley.
You think Jack shot him?
They were out deer hunting, right? Jack probably heard the gun go off, then came back and found the body.
Huh?
How was she?
Who?
No, no, I haven't. Not really. I've growled a little, but I haven't bit.
What about Jill? Is Lillian bringing her?
Yeah. She'll probably quit her job and stay out here with Pop. We can't leave him alone here, he'll set the damn place on fire. With Jill here a lot, it'll be good to have Margie around. Things are going to change in that department, by the way. I got a custody lawyer in Concord. I'm gonna see him tomorrow. All hell's gonna break loose, but it's worth it.
Anything new about the shooting? Twombley?
I think your first response to the Twombley shooting was the correct one.
Okay. It's likely there are people in the union who don't want Twombley to testify. They probably include his son-in-law who's vice-president and will probably be the next president. I read that in the papers. What's his name, Mel Gordon?
I care about what happened. The truth. I'm a student of history, remember?
I'm sorry, honey.
Smart for your age, eh? Top of your class? Tell me, do you know what the word &quot;propaganda&quot; means?
You are a resilient man, Mr.
It was the experience of a lifetime.
Been better, Dad... You?
Got it.
Lemme take a look.
This doesn't make sense.
Air Force One, acknowledged.  tNT. EMERGENCY PARACHUTE LAUNCH RAMP.
We checked the manifest. Everyone was accounted for.
Well it worked.
This is a remarkable aircraft.
Thank you.
How are your fellow hostages feeling, Ms. Mitchell?
Come on, Alice.
I know he left you behind.
Please. You can kill me but leave my daughter alone.
You'll do it?
Yes, sir.
She's a big girl.  She understands.
What?
They're still alive, but the loyalists plan to start killing hostages in forty minutes.
You know my policy. We don't negotiate with terrorists. If we start now, all of America becomes a target.
Freeing Stravanavitch is gonna get tens of thousands killed. I can't live with that.  I'm not royalty. I'm an elected official and the integrity of the office of the President is infinitely more important than the man who holds that office.  We don't negotitate. Not as long as I'm President. Is that understood?
We're under attack.
This is the President.
I never left. Where's my wife and daughter?
A MiG? Where the hell are we?
They better. Fuel's almost gone.
DO YOU SEE TEEM?
Commissioner.
I just wish it was that simple.
I told you, leave the boys in Washington to the boys downtown and the boys down...
Yes I did...
Dunn.
Ask Simon.
If that's the way you want it.
Let me by, Elaine.
Then you <u>do</u> think I'm insane.
What word would you use, Elaine?
Sit down, Elaine.  If this bomb trick works we just might make it.  Simon was a fool to eject now.
The sun will heat that thing to over 450 degrees within seconds.  He'll roast like a pig on a spit.
The human brain is a highly complex organ, Elaine, perhaps the most complex next to the bladder.  Let me show you.  Ted's problem is in this area.  This area, this area, here, here, here, under here, here...
Simon.
Maybe.
Yes, sir.
You can do it from up here, Captain.
Go ahead.
We'll have to check, Jimmy.  It's a pretty long trip to Mercury.
All right.  Here.
I don't want to live anymore.
Have you tried it with a little cinnamon?
Captain Oveur, your navigator, Mr. Unger, and your first officer, Mr. Dunn.
Yes, sir, commander.  This is Mercury One.  Everything seems A- okay up here and ready for count-down.
Thanks, but we have a terrific woman in on Thursdays.
Now he's D-Y-I-N-Ging and wants to be buried on Mercury.
You'll have to be more specific than that, sir.
Death, death.  How about the first Thursday in March, ten o'clock.
Kurtz, you're drunk.  Who's in command of this ship?
I'm familiar with your work, Doctor. You'll have to excuse me, I have to go.
We were in love but I'm not sure I know what love is anymore.
Well, we laughed.  We laughed all the time.
Thank you. Cream?
Oh, yes. Come in, Paul. Rex will be right out.
I <u>am</u> serious, and don't call me Shirley! What flying experience have you had?
I can't tell.
Yes. Yes, of course.
No.
Ted!
I have been patient and I've tried to help, but you wouldn't even let me do that.
I love you, Elaine.
That's the way I've always wanted it to be, Elaine.
What happened, Ted? What went wrong?
Who wants to be first?
I think so, but I've never seen it so acute.
You promise you'll write.
Oh, Bill, I'll keep it. I'll keep it with me all the time.
Runway niner. It's the longest, and directly into the wind.
Yeah, I think he is.  Hey, Fred!
What is it?
I think you're the greatest. But my Dad says you don't work hard enough on defense.
...and that lots of times you don't even run down court.
No, why don't you take care ot it?
No. No thank you.
I think you're just a little scared now, about what you might find once the lights go out.  A little scared... and a lot curious.  Maybe more than you want to admit.  But doesn't that turn you on, that curiosity and fear, swirling together?  Think of it as broadening your horizons.
Ss'ai k'ss?  Perfect.
The young woman at the front said you might know where he is.
Jesus, Sykes -- it's been less than ten hours.  Me and Alterez are on it, okay?
It is his new partner that I'm worried about.
His body was discovered three days ago, in an alley off of Central Avenue, near downtown.
Through the chest.  Rupturing both the primary and secondary hearts.
There was no wallet... but he was still wearing a watch and two rings.
Yes.
Possibly.  Good.  Well, would you be willing to accept the theory, George, that... possibly... by examining the evidence from one case we might shed some small ray of light on the other?  Does that sound unreasonable to you?
Shouldn't we examine their personal effects?
A rubber.  A condom.  You know... Coney Island whitefish?  Men, human men, put them on their, uh -- penises -- to protect against having babies.  You need this for anything?
How the hell do you know that?
My partner is dead!  Because one of you bastards killed him -- then disappeared into a rathole down in Slagtown, where he's home and dry, 'cause nobody sees nothing, nobody says nothing...
Stay back!  I'm okay.
From quarantine, when my people first arrived here.  He and I were housed together.
In the camps, we were lodged four to a room.  The selection process was entirely random.  We did not get to stay with our friends... or families...
Through his ass.  Next time you see him, tell him to call me... unless you want us to keep coming back on you like a bad case of herpes.
My wife?  She worries about me.
I appreciate your honesty, George.
No shit, Holmes.  You're only from another goddamn planet, for chrissakes.
Don't count on me, George.  I never had any ideals.
To the... to the beach?
No.  I cannot involve you.  This is not your concern.
We all did.
Where is the drug?  Where have they taken it?
The fifty kilos, Matthew.  I have to find it.  I can't let it get out on the street.
It'd be for your own good.  I think you'd be better off with a partner who's a little more... by the book.  ... Still, I gotta tell you, George, for a quiet guy, you're sure hell on wheels once you get going.  I'd kinda hate to miss your next two days as a detective.
There!  Go back.  Down that side street.
What is it?
Well, one of the men didn't like him so much...
We think he could'a been involved, yeah.  You know him?
I think you're gonna find he's taken the rest of his life off.
Yes it is.  Thirty-five percent pure Methane gas in there.  I don't know how these fellas do it.
Try Joshua Strader, will ya, darlin'?
Sure.  Just a minute.
Yeah... I seen him around.  High- roller dude named Strader.  Joshua Strader.  Runs a club on the west side.  Encounters.
Yeah.
Captain.  I'd like to volunteer for duty with the new detective.
Departmental policy.
Put on your wash-and-wear suit and your clip-on tie, have your landlady tie your shoes for you, and show up at the church.  Simple.  Me and Carol are going.
Let's go...let's go.  Cycle through!
Awright.  Fire-team A.  Gear up. Let's move.  Two minutes. Somebody wake up Hicks.
Vasquez, take point.  Let's move.
Let's go.  Pull 'em out.
Now let me get this straight. The aliens paralyzed the colonists, carried them over there, cocooned them to be hosts for more of those...
Well, the queen is always physically larger then the others.  A termite queen's abdomen is so bloated with eggs that it can't move at all.  It is fed and tended by drone workers, defended by the warriors.  She is the center of their lives, quite literally the  mother of their society.
All right.  Let's get on it.  What'll you need?
See you soon.
Just tell them what happened.  The important thing is to stay cool and unemotional.
Hear me out...
Well, it didn't occur to me.  It's been policy for years to have a synthetic on board.
I suggest you study the disks Ripley has been kind enough to prepare for you.
Yeah?  Maybe the organisms like the heat, that's why they built...
She's right.
We're trained to deal with these kinds of situations.
So...then the fusion containment shuts down.
They're but off!  Do something!
Yeah.  I've noticed.
All right!  She's alive.  I believe it.  But we gotta get moving!  Now!
We ain't going anywhere.
Look, man, let's just bug out and call it even, okay?
Maybe you haven't been keeping up on current events, but we just got out asses kicked, pal!
How?  The transmitter was on the APC.  It's wasted.
Can't be.  That's inside the room!
Christ.  Some honch in a cushy office on Earth says go look at a grid reference in the middle of nowhere, we look.  They don't say why, and I don't ask.  I don't ask because it takes two weeks to get an answer out here and the answer's always 'don't ask.'
You're really something, ace.
I'm sorry, Newt.
Why do they tell little kids that?
Did one of those things grow inside her?
You mean dead.
Wah...?  Where are...?
I know, honey.  Me too.
DO you know how to get to the landing field from here?
Thank you, Officer Ripley.  That will be...
Because I don't have to.  The people who live there checked it out years ago and they never reported and 'hostile organism' or alien ship.  And by the way, they call it Acheron now.
Sixty, maybe seventy families.
I need to net one birdie only And I will stop feeling so lonely. But if she won't fly to my aid, Then into a ghost I must fade. I need to net one birdie only But if she won't fly to my aid, Then into a ghost I must fade.  To a ghost I must fade! To a ghost I must fade!
Well, do you know where it's set, my dear?
A Turkish brothel.
My dear, it will hardly enhance your reputation to be celebrated throughout Vienna as a singing prostitute for a Turk.
You were sublime.
Don't bother!
What??
I wish you to return immediately to Salzburg. Your father is waiting for you there patiently. I will speak to you further when I come.
I want to go back to Vienna.
Just say it - you'll see. It's very serious. Em iram!  Em iram!
You borrowed money from your mother?
Well, don't do that again!
No!
Your father is dead.
Well, you liked it, didn't you? Monkey-flunki-punki.
Stanzi-manzi, I'll put it in your hand!
It's killing me.
Madame. How can I help you?
No, sir. This is my own idea.
Sir, we really need this job. We're desperate. My husband spends far more than he can ever earn. I don't mean he's lazy - he's not at all - he works all day long. It's just! he's not practical. Money simply slips through his fingers, it's really ridiculous, Your Excellency. I know you help musicians. You're famous for it. Give him just this one post. We'd be forever indebted!
Don't keep calling me that. It puts me at such a distance. I was not born a Court Composer, you know. I'm from a small town, just like your husband.
Yes, sir. He doesn't make copies.
He's doing his best.
Oh yes, and who are you? He's worked for Kings. For the Emperor.  Who are you?
Oh, yes.
Michael!
Yes. He is a little strange.
You are cattivo, Court Composer.  I want to meet this young man. Chamberlain, arrange a pleasant welcome for him.
It's just a trifle, of course.
Majesty.
Ah-ha!
Finally! Such an immense joy. Diletto straordinario!
Really?
Did we vote in the end for German or Italian?
Well, I mean occasionally it seems to have, how shall one say?  How shall one say, Director?
My dear fellow, there are in fact only so many notes the ear can hear in the course of an evening. I think I'm right in saying that, aren't I, Court Composer?
Enchanted, Madame.
In my opinion, it is time we had a piece in our own language, sir. Plain German. For plain people.
Don't you have a maid?
Composition doesn't pay. You know that.
Mine?
I never saw this girl in my life.  Is this a kind of joke?
Papa!
No one calls you that.
Hush! I'm talking to His Majesty. Your Majesty, I wish to express only one thing - that you who are the Father of us all, could teach our children the gratitude they owe to fathers. It is not for nothing that the Fifth Commandment tells us: 'Honour your Father and Mother, that your days may be long upon the earth.'
Do any pupils come to the house?
Yes what?
I suppose so. He sits there all he time, doing some silly opera.
No, no, I love that. I'd want it to be in German. I haven't done anything in German since Seraglio.
Oh! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! What have you got for me? Is it finished?
What? The vaudeville, what'd you think?
Well, we can.
Is my pupil still anxious to learn the art of music?
It really is the best music one can hear in Vienna today. Don't you agree?
So you see, this post is very important to me right now.
Why? Here is the music. It's here. I am submitting it humbly. Isn't that what you wanted?
I'm afraid not.
Ah, how exciting! Tell me more.
Cream cheese mixed with granulated sugar and suffused with rum. Crema al Mascarpone.
Forgive me. We all have patriotic feelings of some kind.
I think it's marvelous. Truly.
How could it not, Excellency?
Oh no! One hears such sounds and what can one say, but - Salieri!
How much?
Of course.
So now - A minor. Suddenly.
First bassoon and tenor trombone - what?
Also identical?
Yes, yes - go on. The Voca Me. Suddenly sotto voce. Write that down: sotto voce, pianissimo. Voca me cum benedictis. Call me among the blessed.
You go fast!
Exactly.
Yes, but this is not a ballet. This is a dance at Figaro's wedding.
But surely the Emperor didn't mean to prohibit dancing when it's part of the story.
On the contrary.
Mozart, you are not the only composer in Vienna.
I am Father Vogler. I am a Chaplain here. I thought you might like to talk to someone.
Offer me your confession. I can offer you God's forgiveness.
I know a little. I studied it in my youth.
Ah - you've heard that?
God's ways are not yours. And you are not here to question Him. Offer him the salt of penitence. He will give you back the bread of eternal life. He is all merciful. That is all you need to know.
I did.
Did we?
What do you mean - now?
Oh, I'm tender enough for you, my boy. I'm tender enough for you.
I agree, Baron.
Indeed. Just a moment - as a matter of fact I think I do know someone who could commission a work from him. A very appropriate person to do so. Yes.
Yes, I am looking after him.
The American? Yes, duck.
I'm an orderly, not a bleeding psychiatrist! I push things about, but I've little say what happens to them.
What did he say?
They were lying. There were no witnesses, no escaped lunatic. The whole community is hiding the truth of what actually happened up there.
No. He knows no one in London, besides me. I shouldn't have left him alone.
David has suffered a severe trauma. I myself witnessed some form of mass neurosis in East Proctor. If all the villagers believe that Jack Goodman was killed by a werewolf, why shouldn't David? And then it follows that if he survived an attack by a werewolf, wouldn't he himself become a werewolf the next full moon?
Let's call the police and see if they can help us find our wandering boy.
Yes?
How is that?
Will you give me a break?
Twenty-eight.
A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court by Samuel L. Clemens. This is after the preface but before chapter one: A Word of Explanation. You all right?
Will you think about it?
I'll let you know the next full moon.
I would think so.
Charming.
Yes?
Of course.
I wasn't hallucinating.
Do me an enormous favor?
I don't know why I feel so good. I haven't felt this good in a long time.
No.
No.
Yes, Mrs. Hobbs.
Hey, you asshole! I want you to arrest me!
Queen Elizabeth is a man! Prince Charles is a faggot! Winston Churchill was full of shit!
Shakespeare was French! The Queen Mother sucks cocks in hell! Shit! Fuck! Piss!
What time is it?
What are you going to see?
So they said.
Sure, as a kid. But never so real. Never so bizarre.
I've told you, it wasn't a man. It was an animal. A big wolf or something. A rabid dog.
Look, Dr. Hirsch, I know I've been traumatized, but Jack was torn apart. I saw him. A man can't do that to someone with his bare hands.
Did you see Jack?
Then why the hell are you so quick to disbelieve me? You yourself said it must have taken incredible strength to tear apart a person like that.
Of course not, David. I'll fetch in young Miss Price.
Yes.
I'm talking about a girl you want to fuck, so give me a break.
If you don't stop, I'm going to kill you.
Of course, The Slaughtered Lamb. Why else would they have a severed wolf's head on a spear as their symbol?
Listen, at least it's warm in here.
Apparently so.
Come on, I'm freezing.
I don't know. Now that we're out here and it's three degrees, I'm not so sure I wouldn't rather face a blood-thirsty mob.
I'm well aware of how pleasant the weather is in Rome at the present time thank you.
I heard that.
Yeah.
Get the fuck out of here, Jack.
Stop it, Jack.
Don't be an asshole, David. Come here.
David, I'm sorry I upset you yesterday, but you must understand what is going on.
What do you think?
You must believe me.
Hi, David.
What about the zoo?
How shall I do it?
If you did it wrong, it would be painful. You'd choke to death.
Come in, come in. Please sit. Some tea?
Stay here. If we need you, we'll know where to reach you.
Sgt. McManus, are you suggesting that David and Jack were, in fact, attacked by some animal and that the officialdom of East Proctor has conspired to keep it a secret? We have an autopsy report on the murderer who was shot in the act by the local police. We have two witnesses to the crime. You'll forgive me, Mr. Kessler, if I consider your testimony as coming from someone who has gone through a terrible shock.
I was the first one to see it. I was coming down the stairs, and there was the watchman lying dead at my feet.
Matt?
How much?
Yeah?
Oh, is he? We carry more unsecured paper than any other institution in the city. We're fools to tolerate it.
Dickson doesn't have to go. But he must agree to this merger with New York Trust—
What good will that do?  Why, it will take control away from him. We'll put somebody else in charge, call in all doubtful loans, and be on safe ground again. That's what good it will do!
All right, let him! I'm sick and tired of hearing about him. If he wants to run the bank, let him do it. I don't want any part of it.
Just pure luck!
Not at all. That's Alexander Hamilton's idea[5] - the finest banking mind this country has ever known. Those are his exact words, gentlemen. Character!  It's the only thing you can bank on, and it's the only thing that will pull this country out of the doldrums.
That sounds very simple, Dickson, but why should we jeopardize our personal fortunes?
The bank. All right. Do anything you want with it.
We've been waiting fifteen minutes—
If you don't mind, Inspector, I'd rather not say - that is, unless it becomes absolutely essential. You see, she's married.
Somebody must be in good humor. He was humming "Mother Machree."
Stand back, Inspector. Let me out of here, or I'll shoot you!
Gambling - I owed them a lot of money. Last week I lost over fifty thousand dollars!
Nothing, nothing, Mr. Dickson. Don't pay any attention to me. I don't know what I'm saying.
She just came up for a drink. Just for a few minutes.
Get out, get out!
You don't have to do nothing.
Listen, buddy, you're getting by pretty easy. Quit squawking!
Why, I needed a—
Yes, yes, it does. What are you doing tonight, Phyllis?
Please, please don't laugh at me, Phyllis. I must see you tonight!
I've loved you ever since I can remember, long before you married Tom Dickson.
What's the matter? Afraid papa will spank?
Oh, you're not so badly off. There's something much worse than being a misunderstood wife.
I'm listening.
No?  Then maybe you'll understand, Mrs. Dickson. Oh, gee, he's crazy about you. Nobody knows it better than you. If he ever finds out, it'll kill him.
That makes it unanimous. I feel all right too.
Hello, darling.
Yes.
Last night? Er - why - uh, last night . . .
Ummm. Stalling, eh?  Anything new?
Helen, I'm going to Philadelphia, just as soon as the bank closes. Make all the arrangements, will you?
Mr. Schaffer will take good care of you. He'll give you fifteen - maybe twenty . . .
I suppose you want me to fix that up for you too, eh?
The clock opposite the vault was stopped by a bullet at 12:09.
What are you talking about? He had no more to do with it than you did.
Why, you must be crazy. I've known this man for years.
Don't worry, Mr. Dickson. We'll find out whether he's telling the truth. I'll have a man from headquarters check up on it right away.
All right. Send down to the vaults and have our reserve cash sent up here right away.
Get all the big bills in the place. Take them out and get them changed. Get nothing but ones and fives. Distribute them among the tellers. Tell them to take their time. Stall as much as possible. Count and recount the money.
Is it safe?
Come here, honey!
Oh, ten dollars—
Well, he was making love to her.
Can you imagine that guy? He was kissing her.
All right, dear.
Yes. He called some of the biggest people in town.
Yes, why?
He was here?
Yes, I know. Cause the Dooley sisters weren't in yet.
Okay, Matt.
Yeah, what did he do with his first one?
Charlie's upstairs as sore as a pup. He's out fourteen cents, and he can't find it.
I said like a Comanche, not this Comanche.
Sometimes a wound will kill.
Zee, I'm pleased you came.
He's not bad at it.
I can hit those boys from here. We just need a distraction.
Nope.
... Will Perry ...
Tomorrow.
Exactly.
One false move and I'll blow your heads off!
You are a fine figure of a man.
You, ya barrel of pork lard. Here piggy piggy!
What's going on?
What is wrong with you?
It was exciting.
So what do we do, General Lee?
Sorry.
I've robbed just as many banks as you have! I know this town, and I know this bank, and I say it's an easy job.
Then let me run the show, General Lee.
Clell, Tom, go get Doc Mimms in Liberty!
Pass me some whisky.
Both would be nice.
Which one, right or left?
Get buckets!
Ho-yah. Him say tell Big Lawman in Carville that badman Jesse James riding toward Rising Sun, above Great River, near Eagle Rock.
I'd appreciate that.
I had you covered.  From back there.
My little Web did that?
Go on. You're pretty much all healed up.
No, Jesse, your problem is you're always doing stuff before I'm finished figuring it out.
I'm sure it seemed like a good idea at the time.
Think about this. If we just come up with a story and stick to it, we should be all right.
You can shut up now.
I swear I'll shoot you in your sleep.
What do you think?
A fair number, Ma.
We're just fine, thank you, sir.
Somebody's in a vengeful smiting mood today.
Shush.
What?
A river pirate.
And what's this right girl like?
Sparkling rocks?
"Hmm" what?
Stop it. This is just sad.
What?
Yes ma'am.
You had all those cattle there, so I'd think the extra men were in town from the cattle drive?
I figured.
Fair enough.
Right here in church?
I'm the same age you were when you went off to war.
Yeah. Hey, are you drinking whisky? You're too young to be drinking whisky.
You're gonna tell her when you're resting up in bed with her, Jimmy.
I hope you don't mind, Jesse James told me your name.
Lyla Devereux.
They donate money to farmers, to churches. Rumor has it they gave the sharecroppers of Maddox so much money they were able to build a school.
Move you fools!
Two weeks ago, we managed to arrange to have the Army hang one of the local farmers.
I look forward to seeing it.
What, sir?
Not such a menace now, is he, Pinkerton?
Not to mention my men who lost their lives.
I can't believe this.
What is that?
Pumpkin?
Pumpkin you're dating an asshole.
Pumpkin you're dating the biggest dickweed in New York.
Eight?
Yes.
Take it off.
Dinner at the River Cafe. Au Bar afterwards, maybe.
I never knew you smoked.
I'm not supposed to.  But I can make an exception.
My friend told me I should maybe even get a lawyer.
Evelyn?
Is your Evian spiked?
Everybody's good-looking, Patrick.
It's not.
My need to engage in homicidal behavior on a massive scale cannot be, um, corrected, but I have no other way to fulfill my needs.
Good coloring.
How did you guess?
No, he doesn't.
But wait, Harold, what do you mean?
No, you...didn't?
Lucky, I guess.
Uh huh.
Commes des Garcon.
Where are you going?
Calm down. Let's do it anyway
But wait. You ain't seen nothin' yet.
Impressive. Very nice. Let's see Paul Owen's card.
Leaving what?
I'm leaving! I...am...leaving!
I'm just a happy camper. Rockin' and a-rollin'. VAN PATTEN  Rehab's done wonders for you, pal. Working for UNICEF now?
See you then.
Come on, you're prettier than that.
Can you bring Mr...
Bring us an ashtray for Mr. KIMBALL, please. She whisks in with a crystal ashtray as they sit in silence.
No, come on. Anywhere you want.
You didn't give them a name.
Thanks, Patrick. I'd love some.
Who's Ted Bundy?
Hmmmm.
I know I should go. I know I have a tendency to get involved with unavailable men, and...I mean, do you want me to go?
No. No, I guess not. I don't want to get bruised. You're right, I should go.
Jean-I'm not-
What is it, Patrick? Are you alright?
What do you think I do?
I m into, well, murders and executions mostly.
That's...that's too bad.
Oh yeah. Oh I get it. Fun with chocolate.
Yeah, well, oh boy, listen, I've got to go. Thank you, uh... Victoria?
Oh, I don't know, Victoria. I'm at work all the time.
You're at Paul Owen s.
Nothing like that. I'm just a private investigator.
No. I'm okay.
The disappearance of Paul Owen.
Shoot.
Fifty-five West Eighty-First Street. The American Gardens Building.
Thanks.
Well...
No. Not really.
No, he just hung out there.
Do you have any witnesses or fingerprints?
No.
It's just strange.  One day someone's walking around, going to work, alive, and then...
Oh really? I didn't know that.
Don.
0h no. Informal conversations, mostly. What's that, Stoli?
Wait. That's not what I've got.
You re so kind, mister. You're kind. You're a kind man. I can tell.
Please...I don know what to do. I'm so cold.
I can't...I can't find a shelter
Oh well, you know.
Yeah, well, you're late.
Then you've gotta ask him about that.
Didn't you visit the campus?
Prob'ly waiting by the phone for Outpost to call. We'll leave it for him?
Isn't that -- extreme?
I don't know! I just know it was Teddy's code. All these ideas flying in from everywhere. You know how he says "Any kid working in his garage can put us out of business?" It's like they know what every kid's doing.
Nobody does work like this on-line. It's in your PC, or in a mainframe. Self-contained. They'd have to be, like, watching people. Physically.  Oh Jesus.
"Like this?" It's Gary you're talking about.
Milo. Why would he --
Even if all this were true. There're 20 other buildings. All of them filled with computers and --
...Why?
...Different?
Look at me! I'm gonna change.
Yeah? Give me a goodbye kiss.
Instead of busting my chops you should do something about that girl. Fire her. Or something.
Prick.
Right... What's that mean again?
It's just -- I kind of feel the need to do something with my ability. Create something...
I am. I am, sir.
You can't pre-empt Yoga, that's our biggest show.
No. But you can write your own ticket in the Valley after this. We're gonna bring down Outpost.
What'd they ever do for you?
Gimme the coordinates?
You should've called a few times to bug me about your job prospects.
We tried!
Would you like a Coke or something?
It needs a more object-oriented language. This doesn't scale, does it?
I do!
Don't spend too much time searching. You ever vetted somebody's old code before?  It's a different skill. Stay close to the surface. The best-hidden secrets are in plain sight. You know the best place to hide a leaf, right?  In a tree.
I'm sure.
Definitely.
Just once. 'Guess I was worried we didn't have anything to talk about, since work was off-limits. Non- disclosure.
I'm not much good at handwriting. Or parties.
Nothing does. Still. I want him to like me.
'Knows I'm altering the coordinates. Let's jump to #12.
Got out of my other commitment.
Cool.
I'm calling Gary.
Where we going?
You know my name.
We moved around so much I barely knew my teachers.
...Something like that. Yeah.
No, I know what you mean. I used to spend my life wishing people could be like computers. Least they make sense. Sometimes you think they've betrayed you. Like a person would. But then you see, no, you just missed a step. You can go back and make it all work.
Yeah? I ran it for lots of platforms, ranging from the narrowest bandwidth to --
"There is no second place." Plus every time I get jammed-up, Gary has an inspiration.  Is it like that with your counselor?
You're compulsive.
Why's that?
Why would you do a thing like --
The Day Care?
They're already watching you. If they had to, they'd give him this drug that mimics an alcoholic blackout. He'd wake up not even remembering his "act of revenge."
No, no. Never.
They've got this guy in the DOJ, maybe others. We tell the wrong person, it's over.
There's always a logical answer -- you just have to define the question.
What?
The dishes are juiced up, too.
Milo? Shrot suspects somebody broke into #21. I was in his office when he was reviewing the card readouts.
He doesn't know about the Day Care.
But you said the other --
Outpost made me sign 1,000. 'Guess we'll find out what else we have to talk about. Life stuff.
What?!
Jesus, Teddy.
No! I keep thinking it'll go away. But there's this -- connection. She's been hacking since she was little, she had to move around a lot. Plus I see her every day, we're working on the same program. She's -- beautiful.
Wait a second. I'm the one who found out he was mucking around in here in the first place.
What do you want, Mr... Cunningham, was it?
Virtucon's main interest is in cable television, but they do have a subterranean construction division, yes. How did you know?
Damn. What exactly do you do at Virtucon?
We know all that, Exposition.
Oh, and Austin...
The shouting is a temporary side- effect of the unfreezing process.
Immediately. You'll be working with Ms. Kensington.
Yes?
Austin, Vanessa, let me bring you up to speed. Dr. Evil has high- jacked a nuclear warhead from Kreplachistan and is holding the world ransom for one-hundred billion dollars. If the world doesn't pay up in four days, he's threatening to destroy the world.
What's the other thing you're scared of?
Well, you can't always get what you want.
Don't try to suck up to me! It's a little late for that. I'm a freak! Look at it, it's been rendered useless.
Your freedom has cause more pain and suffering in the world than any plan I ever dreamed of. Face it, freedom failed.
Well, as long as people are still having promiscuous sex with many anonymous partners without protection, while at the same time experimenting with mind-expanding drugs in a consequence-free environment, I'll be sound as a pound.
If it's a lie, goddamn her. It it's the truth, goddamn me.  God, I hope that's witty. How's your mum?
We don't use the term 'Negro' anymore. It's considered offensive.
Sure.
No, actually. I don't know how to put this really. Well, there have been fabulous advances in the field of dentistry.
That cat Number Two has an X-ray eyepatch. I get bad vibes from him, man. Listen, we should go back to the room, but first I have to go to the naughty chair and see a man about a dog.
How do you know?
He's too well-protected right now.
Let me tell you a story. There's these two bulls on top of a hill checking out some foxy cows in the meadow below. The young bull says, 'hey, why don't we run down the hill and shag us a cow?', and the wise old bull replies, 'no, why don't we walk down the hill and shag all the cows?'
No worries, luv. We'll just give Basil a tinkle on the telling bone...
I couldn't have another bite.
I'm not. I'm the sensible one. I'm always the designated driver.
Only sailors use condoms, man.
Well they should, filthy beggars, they go from port to port.  Alotta meant nothing to me.
Thirty years of political and social upheaval. The fall of the Berlin wall, a female Prime Minister of England, the abolishment of Apartheid, a fascinating tapestry of human strum und drang.
Basil was very concerned to know where you were last night.
Do you think she's prettier than I?
Don't worry, baby. I picked up a mind control technique during my travels to India. I learned it from my guru, the late Guru Shastri, a chaste man who mysteriously died of a disease that had all the hallmarks of syphilis.  Just watch me. Watch me, now.
Too right, youth. That's why I need you to lead the troops.
Anyways, what I'm trying to say is that if you want me to be a one-woman man, well, that's just groovy, because... I love you.
Lay it on me.
Sure.
Is it one of ours?
That's a direct order. You didn't see a thing!
Hello up there! Anyone! Can someone call an ambulance? I'm in quite a lot of pain.
Evil, actually, Doctor Evil.
We've heard from Scott, now let's hear from you.
But what if he escapes? Why don't you just shoot him? What are you waiting for?
Blow me.
Seriously?
... love ...
Out in India. So character-forming for the British. Not the heat. Good Lord, no. The rain, dash it. A good monsoon. Fifteen inches overnight. A whole week of lovely rain. I remember one summer in Jaipur ...
Sir August...?  What now?
As you see.
We have met ...
Let me guess -- 'Father'?
Directed by laser. Bounced by satellite. Quite possible.
The death of Peter Peel was a great loss. To us all ...
To find out who killed my husband.
You killed my husband.
I'm already married ...
Valentine, listen to me ...
How Wagnerian ... Do you mean to say you've waited all these years because you couldn't create a chip on your own? That would have amused Peter.
What are my choices?
I'll never marry you.
So what was all this -- some sort of test?
Whereas you are.
Rules are made to be broken.
After our fencing match, I was rather hoping you would do the risking. More tea?
Did he say who?
How on earth can you tell?
Is that written in his shoe?
Don't bother.  Here's a bus ...
Filling in mother nature's blind spots ... ?
But if someone miniaturized the process...
Sounds as if someone's hijacked your research.
... And by you, Mrs. Peel ...
Barely.
I expect we'll have to gatecrash.
Mrs. Peel ... ?
I expect that's for you to know and me to find out ...
Not for a moment.
No idea who. No idea why ...
I'm a wanted woman, I know ...
Why's he called 'Invisible'?
I'll catch you up. Don't worry; he's expecting you.
Snuff.  I must insist you try some.
Still a bit chilly ...
I know all this.
Who's now vanished.
Are you suggesting that Dr. Darling and Valentine were somehow in this together? But that's absurd.
Well, I can't possibly go like this.
... and now?
We want Mrs. Peel.
Brenda and I thought we'd drop in.
She was ...
Valentine Peel. I see you've gone back to using your original face.
You wish.
Bobbie, what are you talking about?
They'll probably get drunk, and watch dirty movies. But don't worry about the dirty movies.
Right in here. The big show starts in one minute.
Too bad, man, that blows my chance to be Ambassador to France.
Hey, man, congratulations!
I'm marrying Debbie.
What is this person's story here?
Gee, guys, what should I do? The car or Debbie?
Fan out and look for them.
Thank you, sir.
I've tried to change her mind.
It's all right, I forgive you. I'm not the vengeful type. We'll forget what happened. Why don't we take a trip together? Maybe kill a few lions in Kenya over Christmas.
You know, when you dumped me for that wimp, I thought, Cole, she'll be back. God wants the two of you to be together, and sure enough...
About what?
I think the only think you've left out are our relations with the Soviet Union. Sweetheart, everything's gonna be all right.
C'mere.
Gonna get married...
How wonderful. A seeing eye hooker.
I am committed. I love you.
Look, you heard what those hookers said. They were supposed to go to a bachelor party.
My pleasure, Al... Always happy to help out in a pinch...  Excuse me. I better call my service... tell them where I am.
Hey. I'm sorry. You want girls. I'll give you girls.
Gary, you're quite an animal.
That's it.
C'mon, Larry. Be good for you.
Yeah, I guess so.
I couldn't find any razor blades.
Ha, ha, ha.
Rick!
You can tell a man by his friends.
The phone made me do it!
Klupner.  Mrs. Klupner.
This isn't right.
About what?
I don't know.
Still drawing a blank.
Nah, not yet. Look, you're my older brother. I need some advice here. What's the deal with marriage? What can I expect?
Tim, fill out the alarm card.  Clean the pipe poles, wipe down the ladders and hang some hose.
It isn't safe, man. Don't go splittin' us up. Not with this one.
-- You can't let him turn you against your friends, man --
Stevie... I...
He's alive.
Who asked you?
Millions, Stephen -- And sexual favors.
I wanted to know why you messed with my station assignment. I mean, is this really gonna have to one of those big brother -- little brother "you broke my GI Joe and I'm still pissed" games?
What you did was drop the ball, Probie. Get that right.
He didn't listen? He was a fucking candidate! He was your responsibility. He shouldn't have been there in the first place, Stephen.  You burned him.
Just... Just wanted to say hello...
I know.
What are we going to do about this?
I'm sorry... I'm sorry I thought... I won't.
Yeah? What have you been up to?
Yeah, well I like to think I'm just a little past hanging out on JP II watching the Irish pick fights and Litwalks barf in the planters.
So now you suddenly care about my future?
Straightest answer your department's given me all week.
How's it going?
Well, you did invite me here.
But Rimgale's probably going to come around to arson.
Then why did you quit?
Uh huh.
-- You could have scared the son of a bitch off. We may never bust him now. All for a couple's political points.
Yes.
That's a dumb thing to say.
I quit two days ago, Brian.
It's a small town.
I... I thought it was great. I loved it. It was nothing to these guys... medium deal.
Trychticholorate.
But he killed these guys.
Yeah, you'd be surprised what three years can do to a kid.
Stephen told him you were killed in a hot tub accident.
And I'm a huge fan of what you did to save that woman, Brian.
Management were pin heads.
Coffee sucked.
I'll be there, goddamn it!
Fixing my roof.
Coffee? Nah, I gotta go.
He's out.
-- No, that's okay. It's just Sean...
He works for me.
I know you.
Tell him about me, Shadow?
And the world -- the whole world.
What do you listen to, Stephen?
Alderman.
Investigator...
They're alive, aren't they? Come on, man! Everyone's making such a fucking fuss, just because she's a nun. Just because she wears a penguin suit, the church puts up 50 G for the guys who dared to rape her. Do you think they'd put up a dime if you got raped? Of course not. Or even for your little sister? The virgin? Like shit they would.
Nah...
"The Strawberries"?
Yes.
I forgive you.
Let me think about it.
Yeah, really. I'm no fucking asshole, man. I'm a fucking cop!
How about 7 1/2?
This psycho can.
What case?
Here. Look I'll give you the psyho's number You call him yourself and tell him wnat you want.
It's funny, you knew. But the first thing I think of is kneading the bread that I help bake for the soup kitchen. Maybe that's because my the muscles in my arms still hurt.
Yes, Sister?
How 'bout...
B-L-A-K it is.
I'm on it.
We know.  We know.  Yo, check it, my black brothers, we can't let this slide.  Not this injustice. Nah, no way.  Dem' two real coons iz ill.
Did he gots to be.
Ho!
Let's go NIGGERS.
I order out mostly.  So what do I owe this visit to?
Hook you up?  The Mau-Mau's?  You must be smoking.  Why in the world would I want to hook up a bunch of red, black and green flag-waving pseudo revolutionairies?
Please.
What makes you think he would write a show about the Mau-Mau's.
Microphone check.  One.  Two.  One. Two.  One.  Two.  Hold up.  I gots to give my peeps some props. Brothers introduce yourself.
I'm a revolutionary.
No shame in ya game.  She got ya nostrils, ya chnoz is wide open. Sloan's what we certified ladies' men call low hanging fruit.
Naw, just jokin'.  That's you. That's you.
Don't shoot me, I'm just the piano players.
You'll both get an advance and you can stay with me.
My world famous, famous world Arroz con pollo will be ready very soon.
Yo, check it.  This is good and all that but one day soon I want to have much Benjamins so I can have a nice crib and pay all my bills. You hear me.
We was coming to see you.
Some tap dancing, some singing.
Why?
Because race has always been a sensitive issue in this country. Gary, I have no problem with people disagreeing with the show, it's when folks start trying to mess with my inherent right as an artist, that's when I get mad.  No one, in any way, shape or form should be censored.
Can I finish?  Thank you.  I had a great Aunt, we called her Sister. She went to her grave not believing man had walked on the Moon. 
Go on.  Good so far.
So let's take this great form, this very American tradition of entertainment into the 21st century, into the new millennium.
It is called: MANTAN - THE NEW MILLENNIUM MINSTREL SHOW.
I don't know if Whoopi is the way to go.
And Sleep 'n Eat is his comical sidekick?
To hire someone solely on their ethnicity, gender or religion is not right.  It's un-American.  I will hire someone who is most qualified for this particular job.
Derrick Coleman, he possessed all the talent in the world, coulda, shoulda, been a great ballplayer but alas D.C. didn't want it bad enough.  Delacroix, do you want it? Bad enough to kill for it?  Do you want it that much.
I seriously doubt that will ever happen.  Didn't I tell you I know your people better than you do. But if by some miracle you're correct, I'm gonna invite them inside my house and we'll have a sit down, discuss it like civil human beings.
Hello, Mommy, let me get rid of this other call.
It's been a long time.
Daddy, she's younger than me.
How did you end up here?
Another one of your conspiracies to hold ya career back?
Where do you go from here?
Is that so?
Not that often.  He was excited to see you.
Manray!
You getting cold feet?
This is Cheeba.
It was the principle.  Dunwitty had to be enlightened.  I was making a point.  I take pride in my work. Plus, I already told you I wasn't gonna walk away from my money.
No matter what you think, you did come up with something unique. Open it.
Light?
That's why it will be so much fun.
The first and only time.  A big mistake.  I'm gonna have to ask you not to see Mantan anymore.
I didn't think this was in your studies at NYU.
Pressure?  DeLa, you don't know what the hell real pressure is. SHEEETT!!!  This is lightstuff. Now when you scramblin' out on the street in da January winter and the hawk is talkin' to you with NO money and NO prospects of money anytime soon, now that there is some pressure.
Naw.  I'll take the zero.
Sloan is the hardest working person I've ever met.
I just turned twenty.
Then will you teach me what I need to know.  Maybe we learn from each other, if that's possible, no?
This show was created, conceived by you, a non-threatening African- American male.  Voila.  End of argument.  It can't be racist because you're black.
I'm sure that was the only thing he was impressed with.  You look beautiful like that.
I'm more comfortable around my people.
Give or cousins some of dem educated feets.
...no, she didn't...
That's what I like about you and me. We git along...
How be dat?
Sloan, I got it like 'dat.
Forget about me, are you a puppet for DeLa?
Not at all, sir.  I have a pair of good pistols that have already done execution, and are ready to do it again.
I'm not afraid of highwaymen.  My man is armed, and so am I.
I'll tell you what it is, Mr. Dugan. I have had enough of Miss Dugan here and your Irish ways.  I ain't used to 'em, sir.
It's a lie!  You're a deserter! You're an impostor, sir; Your lies and folly have confirmed this to me. You pretend to carry dispatches to a general who has been dead these ten months; you have an uncle who is an ambassador and whose name you don't know.  Will you join and take the bounty, sir, or will you be given up?
Only a very little, as soldiers do.
The man that marries Dorothy Dugan must first kill me -- do you mind that?
And so I am.
Mark this, come what will of it, I swear I will fight the man who pretends to the hand of Dorothy Dugan.  I'll follow him if it's into the church, and meet him there. I'll have his blood, or he shall have mine.  Will you take my message to him, and arrange the meeting?
It was with this sword that my late father, Harry James, God rest his soul, met Sir Huddelstone Fuddelstone, the Hampshire baronet, and was fatally run through the neck.  He was quite in the wrong, having insulted Lady Fuddelstone, when in liquor, at the Brentford Assembly.  But, like a gentleman, he scorned to apologize.
I had news of you in Dublin.  Faith, you've begun early, like your father's son, but I think you could not do better than as you have done. But why did you not write home to your poor mother?  She has sent half-a-dozen letters to you in Dublin.
The coward!
I am only sorry that I was unable to prevent the villain from carrying off all her ladyship's money and pearls.
Ah -- I see.  No, I'm afraid mine are the O'Higgins of Watertown.
I deny your Grace's accusations, and beg you to say how you have been cheated?
Your Grace, if I am so tame as to take this, then I must give up an honorable and lucrative occupation.
Your honor must lower his voice.
I'd give five years of my life to see the old country again, the greenfields, and the river, and the old round tower, and the burying place.
Have no fear.  It will come out well for me.
To risk one's life against such people is an imposition.
But, for a time... a passing fancy?
Deceiving someone without knowing it is something new for me.  If I do not know it, I am innocent.
With a woman who is completely charming, be she a princess or a woman of the lowest condition, and who, regardless of her rank, will show me some kindness, tonight.
Yes -- but I am afraid of being deceived.
I ask only a payment on account today -- after that, you will find me undemanding, obedient and discreet.
Our abstinence makes our love immortal.  If I loved you a quarter of an hour ago, now I should love you even more.  But I should love you less if you exhausted my joy by satisfying all my desires.
My husband has convinced me of the contrary.
O, my dearest love.  Enough!  I beg you.  Stop believing in your experience.  You have never known love.  My very soul is leaving me! Catch it on your lips, and give me yours!
Agreed.
I don't care a fig for Captain Best; he dances prettily to be sure, and is a pleasant rattle of a man.  He looks well in his regimentals, too; and if he chose to ask me to dance, how could I refuse him?
It is entirely up to you.  I want the best.
Yes!
The Prince left him only that choice.
I am riding to Dublin myself, and if your ladyship will allow me the honor of riding with you, I shall do my best to protect you from further mishap.
I see.
Is it not a pleasure, gentlemen, for me, as I am drawing near the goal, to find my home such a happy one; my wife so fond of me, that she is even now thinking of appointing a successor?  Isn't it a comfort to see her; like a prudent housewife, getting everything ready for her husband's departure?
If his love were like mine, he would not permit you to come here.
Maybe he'll be there. Either way, we have to go.
Can anybody hear me!
We found him like this --
HEY!
We don't know. West is dead.
Fifteen years ago under Sergeant West. Piece of work, that guy. I remember, he used to have these two silver .45's with ivory handles and if you weren't quick enough, he'd knock you on the head with one of them. He still carry those guns?
I'm serious --
They would have killed us both. You want me to write a confession, I'll write a confession.
But not Pike's.
Epilepsy.
Mueller was alone in the cabin?
Don't know on a map. West told us it was there, we just found it. Maybe the hurricane took it away.
West's. Any kindling for afire?
I mean I killed him.  Isn't that what we all wanted?
Yeah...
But not the only victim, right?
Right in front of us. Mueller went after him but we held him back.
I honestly don't know. Maybe to have someone to cover for him. And I wish I could, but there's no doubt in my mind he killed those men.
How many murders did you cover up? One? Five? Maybe an even ten.
No. I said Dunbar.
I didn't do anything --
Because of what I saw.  Who really killed West.
Because I was standing next to him.
And here you are going out of house. How's that make you feel, Jules?
It's not West, is it? Tell me it's not West.
He can wait. Kendall's out of surgery.
Nevertheless what'? Kendall will testify and that'll be enough.
I wouldn't know where to start.  I guess it was about one man framing another. He thought if the other guy got blamed, people would over look his own wrong doings.
That's preposterous --
I wanted to see if he was okay --
You and the Colonel go back.
Senator Jonathan Kendall, of Ohio.
Ten bucks says I have him talking in under three minutes.
Best time for banal chit-chat.
Imagine what it must have been like for them out there. What do you think of Dunbar?
Everyone's capable of murder, Osborne.
I don't know.
Because it's my job. Because people are dead. Because of the whole honor and duty thing, make a difference in the world, crap like that.  We can do this, Hardy.
Let's go talk to Bill...
That's gonna stay my secret.
This is the perfect time. You know what makes a good detective? The number of confessions they get. You're a good detective, Osborne. So now you get mine.
Want company?
I should probably write that down.
In case you need me to testify about the shooting. They'll clear you.
Oh, yeah, "Excuse me, Sergeant, sir, we don't feel like going out -- we don't want to get rained on." He'll kick our asses from here to Cleveland.
So you took off your shirt?
What, "The Truth"? Please. There are degrees of truth, officer, always degrees. Things are not what they seem.
Because he'd shot Mueller.
Like I said, I was in the kitchen. When I came out, Mueller and Pike were dead, Nunez and Childs were hit and Dunbar was gone.
Fifty minutes.
It will and you know why? Because you're not a person anymore, you're a cadet in the United States Army; you have no identity, no Miranda warning, and no rights. So I'm gonna throw you to the wolves, and unlike you, I'm gonna get away with it, because you're pissing me off!
Wrong answer --
What the fuck happened to you? One minute you're next to me and the next you're gone and the sky lights up like fucking Christmas --
What the fuck are you doing?
Shut the fuck up.  He was gonna cut him loose.
The fuck are you talking about --
Ma'am, Ray Dunbar's black.
Sir, yes, sir!
Sir, yes, sir!
Sure I do. You were hot shit back in Hickville, but here in the real world, you got squat. You don't have a plan. You don't have a job. You don't have anything but the clothes on your back.
Kid, you were a big fish in a small pond. This here is the ocean, and you're drowning. Take my advice and go back to Puddleville. You'll be happy there.
Sorry, kid. I don't do charity.
Yes.
Not yet.
He's still here. Let me buy you a drink. I'll tell you all about it. Hell, I'll have him tell you.
I don't expect to.
Fine, I'm doing it.
You're pretty good at arithmetic.
I suspect it will hurt a lot.
How did you know?
I'm not convinced you should be happy.
I know.
I was dreaming.
What's your name, Giant?
Mine's Edward. And truthfully, I do want you to leave, Karl. But I want to leave with you.  You think this town is too small for you, well, it's too small for a man of my ambition. I can't see staying here a day longer.
That poet, Norther Winslow did. He was going to Paris, France. He must have liked it, because no one ever heard from him again.  Tell you what. You take the other way and I'll cut through here. Meet you on the far side.
Your mom says I can't tell you that one anymore. You get nightmares.
You think I'm up for it?
The Old Lady by the swamp.
So how does it happen?
There's a lot you don't know about me.
I will.
It's rude to talk about religion. You never know who you're going to offend.
I think someone hasn't.
Then you shouldn't have started with a question. Because people want to answer questions. You should have started with, "The thing about icebergs is..."
The river?
But you're wrong. I do know you, at least by reputation. Edward Bloom from Ashton. See, I'm actually engaged to a boy from Ashton. Don Price. He was a few years older than you.
I called everywhere in five states and explained this was the only way I could get my wife to marry me.
I have the rest of my life to find out.
I see. We need to get you one of those plant misters. We can spray you like a fern.
I was astonished to see the greatest poet of both Ashton and Spectre all the way out in Texas.
'Fraid so.
Mmm, what?
Everyone loves my father. He's a very likeable guy.
He's impossible. He won't eat. And because he won't eat, he gets weaker. And because he's weaker, he doesn't want to eat.
But I understand you, Mom. I always have.
Heavens no. We had a hard enough time keeping the mortgage on this place.
Yes. Thank you.
No I don't.
Those aren't presents. That's normal friendship stuff
It's nothing. I burnt myself.
It is. I did it cooking.
Ch...
I am actor, he is actor, although he is an actor stroke musician. I just noodle along, I'm not so good. He makes me look like a retard -- He smokes me. I don't mean he smokes me.
Right. So I can say he smokes me. So.
Uh. Do you like England?
What?
No. It's not that.
Fine. I thought you were leaving today.
I'm so sorry.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Happy bath day.
Of course. They go. Yes. Yes.
So you're just going to be vindictive
You can't hurt me more than I'm hurt already.
What?
What? No you're not..
No you're not. How... Nice one. How dumb do you think I am ?
He will come back.
He left me my passport and ticket. It's pretty clear he wants to see me again.
Okay. Let's... Okay. Okay. You have had sex with people you don't like haven't you? For money. To make money.
Sometimes.
Sometimes neither.
I'm trying to quit.
I smoke more these days. I smoke more when I'm unhappy.
Whatever.
It's not mine either.
I'm not asking you to marry me.
It's more like a date.
I'm sorry Sir. I believe the flight is closed.
Yeah, I know.
Oh! Gave me a start.
Been on the crop. May need to get some extra hands if I don't want to work on Sundays.
You take her to a doctor?
I already tossed that out.  Somethin' you should'a done to that woman long ago... how she treated you. Of course, that's none of my business.
At church?
You gonna sing me somethin'?
Come on, just a little somethin'. Right here. Go'on now, don't be shy.
Can I come in?
Can I put it in your mouth?
Yeah. Transmission's shot.
Yeah.
She's around. Always is.
You think I'm Ronnie's spy or somethin'? Come tomorrow that dumb- ass gonna be halfway round the world tryin' to keep his head on his shoulders. You think he's gonna be thinkin' about you?
Can't be thinkin' bout him every second of my day. I'll go outta my gourd.
Say what you gotta say, but I ain't gonna hear you speak his name to me. Not never. You hear?
If we get with a counselor. At the church, maybe they's...
Son, I'm grown. Don't got patience to suffer you children and this monkey junk. I'm too old to play house...  ...and cowboys. So let's have it. End me or get out of my face!
Well I don't...
Why you got me chained?
Get this Goddamn thing off me!
I'm right enough to stand on my own two feet. Now take this Goddamn chain off...
No ma'am.
Or what?
You gonna get a lot more a'that, you keep me locked up like this!
I CAN'T!
Can't sit all day on that sofa. Need to get your legs strong.
Itches.
I don't fuckin' cook.
Sure.
I ain't in a hurry.
You just havin' a fit. You ain't goin' nowhere.
Right here. Be here all afternoon.  You ready for this?
You know how you feel when you come out of a bad hangover? Like your eyes can open a little bit more.
Word wit'cha. In private.
Huh?
What'chu sayin'?
What'chu sayin'?
Uh-huh.
I never laid a hand on her in anger. Not a day. Not even when I's drinkin'. But this business got me wonderin' what a good shake and slap would do for her.
This ain't got nothin' to do with that woman. Just don't want nobody around me now.
You gotta go, R.L.. I ain't foolin' this time.
Man like you ought not take the Lord's name like you just done.
I'm tellin' you the truth, dammit. I found her beat. Left for dead. So I brung her home.
THIS IS HOW YOU HANDLING IT? THIS IS HOW YOU HANDLING IT?
Ask the chef.
We ain't here to talk about that shit.
I do.
That's right.
Rae, look at Ronnie. And tell him how you feel.
Rae!
Ronnie. Please, baby...
Ronnie...
You need money again?
Thought you had a man for that.
-- Hey, I got a better chance of being hit by a bus then moving up.
The Wolf?
Maybe we should do something?
Not a prayer.
Go to sleep, Charlie.
Let's grab some food.
You said that in the last two places.
Sure, a rice burning crotch rocket...
Pussy, ass, soft personnel.
Connie...
I don't deserve Ohashi's respect.
I stole them.
We can ask someone I used to work with.  A criminal.  Someone I pay money to...
Four goddamn days.  This is going nowhere...
Gaiijin.
San is an honorable title.
Big enough.
Why's that?
We can't lose.
I could use some help.  Show me around.  I'll pay you for your time.
Where's Ich?
He drinks.
No one's keeping him here.
Why would you care?
Last time you asked me to come along I nearly got a hole in my head.
Then take it from him.
What?
He killed a police officer.
Right.
Your visa has expired.  Be on a plane in twenty-four hours or you will be deported.
For God's sake, Ohashi, I need your help.  Let me out of here!
I have to get to Sugai.
Not to be trapped.
Here's your check, my boy.  Thank you.
Wouldn't obstruct replication, but it does give rise to an error in replication, so that the newly formed DNA strand carries a mutation and you're got a virus again... but all this is academic -- you are made as good as we could make you.
Also extraordinary things.
You're just all so... so different.
Thank you.
Tomorrow, he says.
Hello, glad to meet you.
Very good, Pris.  Now show him why.
What was the cover on the one that got Holden?
Garbage man?
Yeah.
Soon as I finish the job.
I think we're through for the night.
And what in your estimation works?
Nexus designated Mary:  incept November 1 2017, domestic conditioning non competitive, trained for day care position.
I'll but you one.  What'll you have?
Prosit.
Two months.  But this one is not guy.  It is girl.  His girl.
Prosit.
No thanks.
I'm doing okay.
I'm taking a piss.
No rust?
They'll change the limit before I change my mind.
Never been more sure of anything in my life.
What's suck night?
You talking about the Opera House on the Main?
I don't know nothing about it.
For holes.
Of course he's not real.  You think I'd be working here if I could afford a real snake?
I bet I would.
A humanoid robot is like any other machine, it can be a benefit or a hazard.  If it's a benefit, it's not our problem.
That would be murder, Mr. Deckard.
Sounds like I'm an ass-hole either way, but the answer is still no.
So?
Yeah.
What?
I don't like people snooping around my stuff.
Severed spine.  You'd better get in here.  Bryant's waiting for you.
Nothing is infallible, but so far the Voight-Kampff scale bas been foolproof.
If she is, the machine works.
Thirteen.
I'm tired of this.
Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay attention.  Answer quickly as you can.
Of course.
You reach down and flip the tortoise over on its back, Leon.
Thanks.
Yeah, I live here pretty much alone right now...
You're all so perfect.
No, I'm not! My mom taught me.
She is a dancer! And a lovely one! You would like her very much! Shall we dance?
I knew it! So anyhow, you get on a bus and before you know it, you're out here in the San Fernando Valley without a clue.  Which brings us to here.  Correct again?
Where are you staying? The Holiday Inn?
Yes.
It's Webber.  Adam Webber.
Please don't follow me.  Don't do it!
Can't you please just talk to me for one second?
No.
Hey, no kidding?  In color?
It never works out because I'm into legs and butts and hair myself! That's why! So I wind up with guys who are very good looking, but even more shallow than I am, if you can picture that. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go find another low-paying, demeaning job where some guy named Jerry keeps telling me how lousy his marriage is.
You can be single and not alone. Marriage bites!
I wouldn't know.  What kind of wife are you looking for?
No dogs, huh? Okay.
Sorry!
You said it would be easy!
He's a former boyfriend. We lived together for about six months.  And yes, I'll admit it.  I've still kind of got a thing for him.  That's what you wanted to know, isn't it?
Um-hum.
No.  We keep it in the backyard.  Of course, in the house.  It's in there.
Wazoo!  Try to listen.  Whataya think? Surfer, grunge, hip- hop, Euro trash?
Do I look crazy?
It's a Rob Roy. A very popular drink, I'm told.
Okay. All right.  And what do I say?
Romeo and Juliet. I cried at the end.
You think I'm some sort of sap?! Don't you?!
What in the hell are you doing here!! You're supposed to be over on San Vicente Boulevard having unsafe sex with that slut Sophie!!
Goodnight!
Thanks.
Could I please just go home?  I was lost, but this morning I found home and I promise not to bother any of you ever again.
Yes, it is.
They're pretty.  Can I have them?
Haben sie etuas nettes in leder?!
It's a game, son. I can explain it pretty easily. There's a pitcher.
Your roller-skates! I redesigned them! I think this new design will work even better!
Yes, father?! Yes?
Positive. The Soviet Union collapsed without a shot being fired. The Cold War is over.
Yes, sir. It's true.
Well, Dionne Warwick, guess his home town.
1959.
Yeah.
How do you get through those winters?  Well, you're right.  Juneau.  What's the highest peak?
I just don't want to.
No.
Miss Rustokov refuses to let total strangers drive her car.
So, did you buy a movie?
I know what you mean!  I usually wear a big hat and dark glasses.
Yeah...Seems to.
Of what?
Good night!  Sleep tight.  Don't let the bedbugs bite!  That's what my Mom always says...  ...who I'm really beginning to miss. I'm sorry.  It's my first night away from home.
Yes. Up here on the fifteenth floor. Goodnight.
You could have a meat order that big delivered to your home.
Oh, you got a problem with that?
Oh, no! Oh, my goodness!   Let's get him into the bedroom.
Heck, I know that mom! You're my parents.
Are you in trouble, son?!
A psychiatrist?!
I have to. If a complaint is made and the person resists obser--
Calm down, please. This man needs help and you need protection from him. That's obvious.
And now you must let me be the judge of that!
Yeah.
"Hell up here?"  Honey, it's been hell up here, down there and over yonder! Hell everywhere.
I just hope those plates aren't radioactive by tomorrow morning.
Rather safe than sorry. That's my motto!
Then after that it's safe.
To go up.
Would you like a tranquilizer?
And I was wondering...if...if I could have a...
No reason.  Well, it's pretty clear that the front entrance caved in when the bomb went off. So, you know, when the time is up, we'll have to return to the surface using, you know, this back entrance.  Which is very nice because it has the service elevator!
Yes, he's very bright, dear. Much like his father. But you know, Calvin, maybe he's a little...young for school.
If he tells, it won't come true!
Yeah. Let's dig in!
No.
Oh my. Oh,my, oh my, oh, my. So, what do we do now?
Yes, dear, I know.
Hey, they're Ralph Laurens.  And who's this interesting looking fellow?
Out-of-town.  That's all he'll say.
Oh, my God...
Exactly.  You understand that, don't you?  You have no chance of meeting a woman dressed like that.
And I suppose you see him in some sort of strapless  thing, don't you?
No.
Yes, you do!
He left with Sophie.
Fallout shelter.
Give it back to him.
We'll find him.
Have him committed.
Where?!
Um...uh...
Could I, like...oh, wow...like,uh...
Aunt Barbara. I'll try not to get depressed.
No, I'm just going to walk around the neighborhood. Don't worry.
Okay honey.
Sometimes it helps to talk things over. For instance, many marriages are saved by.
EXCUSE US por favor! Hey. Let Tits see her kid.
You did? A human ear?
Excuse me, Mrs. Williams.
The criminals are winning.
Yes.
Yes I have - so bad I wouldn't poison your mind by telling you.
I won't let the bastards get me up against the wall. It's an act of defiance.
It's blue. Blue velvet.
Yeah.
Yes sir. I sure am.
Nope, it's new stuff. No smell.
I wanted to see you.
Never before this.
I, I don't know.
I'll go then.
No.
Yes.
It's a secret so don't tell anyone. Some day I'll show you where. I've gotta go to sleep now.
That's not crazy. I like you too.
Frank? Can you stand up?
Don? Are you in with them?
Please, please stay.
Frank is coming?
Beeeee careful.
Just get outta my bed.
No, it's not Don.
Why are you here?  HMMMMMMMM!!!! OK.
Oh God, Jeffrey, is that you? Oh God.
It's okay. It's okay.
Who, Dorothy?
Hey Tits, I'm taking your neighbor to the country. Maybe something for you too.
Those are my breasts.
Yeah. I guess I did.  What's going to happen to me?
Yeah. I sure know that. Yeah, but how many more are out there?
No thanks. What does that mean?
Here's to Ben.
What?
There ya go.
I've made arrangements with Dr. Gynde for 10:30. But Jeffrey, you'll have to walk over; I need the car this morning.
Do you want the car?
Of course, Jeffrey.
You were pretty popular. Didn't you run for some office?
Yes.
Where are they?
Yeah, I guess so.  What are you going to do now that you're home?
Still, it must be kinda rough.
I guess so. Like you said. It's a strange world.
Just a minute, pull over and wait a minute.
Let's just try the first part. If that goes well, we'll see about the rest. No one will suspect us, because no one would believe two people like us would be crazy enough to do something like this.
Oh brother. Dorothy Vallens, Seventh Floor. Look on the mailbox for her number, bright boy.
I didn't get a good look at him either, but he sure looked at me. I didn't have time to get a window, but I found this key.  Pretty nifty, huh?
First of all, we'll have a nice dinner. Try to find out where Dorothy sings.
Great. I'll pick you up around eight o'clock. Is that good?
Then we'll drive back to her apartment and I will plant myself there.
Two.
I'll drink to that.
Why not?
It'll be okay. I don't think you should wait out here though. I think you should go home. Can you drive this car?
Oh, okay, can I call?
Look, it can wait till Sunday.
He got a little jealous.
OK. It's a strange world, Sandy. This is what I have found out. What I think I have found out. Dorothy Vallens is married to a man named Don. They have a son. I think the son and the husband have been kidnapped by a man named Frank who has now cut off both of Don's ears. I think he is holding them to make her do things for him. I think she wants to die. The ears were for her a warning to stay alive. There is another man involved. I call him the "yellow man". You saw his back the other day in the hall at her door. I don't know what he does but I think he's on drugs supplied by Frank. Frank is a very dangerous man.
I don't see how I can, and I can't prove any of this. I got all this information illegally. Also it could get you in trouble.
I will. I'll pick you up on the same corner at three thirty-five, okay?
You want to go talk to him?
Frank!!!
No. Is Detective Gordon going to be at your house?
Shhh. I'll tell you.
Mike. We don't have to watch it. Come on.
Got it.
What?
Let's do him right here.
Well... what if your boss knew how many guys were supposed to be there... in that room?
Think about it man. Nine men, six bullets.
I know what the fuck he looks like!
Okay, just calm down. He could hurt us, brother. He could ruin the whole thing.
You won't do it Connor, you won't. You love me man.
We're here brother.
BLAME...
Well, there's my boys.  Shit. I gotta go. Looks like I caused a ruckus with that shot. Half the damn neighborhood is comin'.
I'll see what I can do. How do I get in touch with you?
Right.
Ass!
How many?
Lord have mercy. That was a good one ma.
I gave him his first lesson in sensitivity toward the fairer sex just today.
"We just got up and left. Bum musta rolled them before the police got there."
Don't c-cross the road if ya can't get out of the kitchen.
Oh, you've lost it, haven't ya?
A bit.
Just like on TV.
Aye.
Little girls catchin' stray bullets in their heads, playin' hopscotch in their front yards. And everyone thinks the same thing... Someone should just go kill those motherfuckers.
He's a good man.
Do not kill, do not rape, do not steal. These are principles which every man of every faith can embrace.
Okay then... let's get ya started.
Rule of thumb?
Now look Rozengurtle, we're sorry. Just relax.
Rocco!
My, my...
These guys were pros. I think they were coming for one target, the fag man, he was the...
It tells us that he was the last to die. All these men  Were carrying. They came in, dropped all in seconds and then took their time with fag man. Didn't they, Duffy?!  They sure as fuck did!
Okay, seriously, both you listen ta me now.
Use your brain for once. Is it so unbelievable they don't care about you? You are fuckin' dead, you go in there today. Dead!
I'm fuckin' fine.  Catch you on the flip side.
Hey, Murph.
I'm fuckin' fine.  Catch you on the flip side.
So?
Well, what'ya do?
Fine! Fuck it! When we're done she can I.D. me. I don't care. Just tryin' to be professional, but no...
What the fuck do you mean?
We have to go now.  We're on the lamb.
Why have I come to a church? I never have before. I guess I just... felt I should.
You feel?
How long since your last confession, my son?
Yeah. Thanks, Rocco. See ya.
Uh. Okay... um... you hear the one about the, no fuck that one... uh... oh! oh! Well... shit. Okay, there's a white guy. He's walkin' along the beach and he finds a, a pot, y'know and ah, he rubs it and this genie pops out. But this genie, he's a ni... he's a black guy.
Kind of. Except we've already got the keys.
Yeah, I heard that.
Nothing. Go ahead.
Unlock that door.  Check the aisles.
We got it. We got it.
It's not a plan. It's just --
This morning.
I don't really feel like talking about it. The only thing I feel like is getting the fuck out of this place.
I don't think we can do that.
You're so spoiled. What is "not good" to you? Only a few hundred --
Her name's Inez. Stop calling her the housekeeper.
Shut up!
What's Hinckley Cold Storage?
Right now.
Get out of the way.
I'm sorry, Bob.
I did.
Yeah. It's pretty good.
He was all right.
Good. It's supposed to be.
I don't know.
Yes, there is. Let's get organized.
We're not sure.
What do you mean?
Behind Bob's house.
What?
Yeah. Convert it into lofts. OK. Pop quiz. What's the single most important aspect of your job?
What do you mean?
Yes, he did.
That sounds like Dignan.
Yeah. I mean, I don't think about it all the time. But once in awhile I kind of go, Woah. Man.
Who?
I don't know. Sure, I guess.
There's a million places to hide around here.
I don't know. I personally don't need that shit in my life right now.
He looked too shaken-up.
I don't know. I don't know anything. Except Phil says they got him. And he's in jail.
Is that OK?
No, I don't mind.
Well, I didn't mean to electrocute him. But the whole operation was my idea.
Sixty days?
Why were you drawing the Holy Mary?
No. I wasn't adopted.
My walkie talkie's busted. I can't tell what's going on.
I hear you're a good thief.
Abdul-Shabazz?
Why the fuck do we need to blow up the car? It doesn't make any goddamn sense.
We're going too slow. It looks like we're following him.
So who's going to know?
I'll just drive my car.
Good question.
You're paranoid, Bob.
Hang on. This is important, Bob. Anthony and I are responsible for the internal situation. The money and the people. You're responsible for the external situation. The streets and the getaway.
I just want to see how much bullets it takes.
God DAMMIT.
That's good. Keep it at forty.
Be cool, Bob. Be cool.  Make that light.
No. I was calm.
Well, obviously, we got to go back.
I can't do that, Bob.
What is it?
I don't expect an apology and I don't even want one. I just want us to --
Bullshit.
Who's watching the door? What the fuck are you doing? Get back in position.
What's that?
We don't have rooms, Bob. We have cells.
Here we go.
Now!
He said what?
You're going to need a boxman for this one. But that can be arranged.
Who? Applejack?
Can't get it. It won't... 
Fight. You know.
What?
With all due respect, Pam, I think you might've wandered a little past your pay-grade.
So what's your theory?  Conklin's reaching out from the grave to protect his good name?  The man is dead.
Hold on -- he said he wants to come in.
Did he say anything to you?
I'm sorry, Ward.
I'd rather stand if it's all the same to you.
No. You lost your way.
Thanks.
What do you have, Danny?
Jesus...
Nobody. You.  I had to tell you, right?
Okay... 
I speak English.
Is this really happening?
-- my coat -- but we should --
Conklin up front.
What?
Tell me later.
Yes.
What is this, a game?
Please -- I'm only here because of Paris -- because they can't figure out what you're doing -- I'm here because of Abbott --
I was here!
I want to come in.
I want someone I know to take me in.
There was a girl in Paris. Part of the program. She used to handle the medication.
Sounds like a threat.
I'm working on it.
And the Germans can't match it?
I want to look at the room.  Check it out.
-- no! -- not me! -- no other people! --
I think that Bourne and Conklin were in business. That Bourne is still involved. And that whatever information I was going to buy in Berlin, it was big enough to make Bourne come out from wherever he's been hiding to kill again.  How's that scan?
Before this? Before Bourne? No.
It's got caffeine in it. That's all I know.
I don't know. He was sick. He wanted out. I believed him.
So?
Yeah, that'll work...What the hell was he doing here?
And what about you, anything?
My brother and nephew perished two days ago, when their hay cart turned over.
Homage is nothing. It is the crown that matters!
But if we have not caught Wallace --
Wallace's followers.
Before he lost his powers of speech, he told me his one comfort was that he would live to know Wallace was dead.
Fourteen? --
Mornay has come. So will the Bruce.
Aye.
I rest.
Probably. But we can't win alone. We know that. This is the only way.
Armed?
I wanna have supper waitin'.
Aye, we'll get 'em.
I will not.
Is your Poppa a ghost -- or do you converse with God Almighty?
No. He did not.
He waits. For you. He says he will attack no more towns -- if you are man enough to come fight him.
This is what happens when you must send a woman. And a fool.
Let her speak.
Confess, and you may receive a quick death. Deny, and you must be purified by pain. Do you confess? ...DO YOU CONFESS?!
Thank you for inviting.
Some nights. I have dreams. Mostly dreams I don't want. I started riding at night to fill up my mind so that when I did sleep I'd dream only of the ride and the adventure.
No. You don't choose your dreams. Your dreams choose you.
I... accept your proposal!
This night is too beautiful to have again.
Yes, you are. And you must wake.
And I with you. But you must wake.
York was the staging point for every invasion of my country. And that royal cousin hanged a hundred Scots, even women and children, from the city walls.
A journal. Just have him write down everything he does.
Well, he has been pushing me to meet his father, but I've been putting it off.
Nine, ten. And you're awake! Open your eyes, dammit!
Um... can dad come this time?
You'll be fine. Dr. Redfield just wants to give you some tests. You'll like him.
I can't help it. I'm just so proud of you. You've got the highest grades in all of your classes.
No, it's just weird with him being such a brain and all, I just wondered if he was ever able to remember stuff he'd forgotten.
How's Kayleigh doing? She all right?
Cute, Evan.
Don't worry. I'm gonna get you out of here.
Shit. I knew you were crazy.
No, protecting her.
I can't... the car vanishes and all of a sudden I'm on the ground in the woods.
All I know is that I might be able to unblock some of my repressed memories.
Huh?
So let's go. This place creeps me out.
You really don't remember anything that happened?
I've stopped a hundred times.
Couldn't you have moved in with your mom?
Me? Are you kidding? Why?
What do you want to know, Evan?
You can't hate yourself just because your dad's a twisted freak.
Might'a been nice.  Like this is gonna do any good. Maybe one of the frat guys has a gun.
What?
Nice to see you, too. Can I come in?
No. Just that you need to hurt me with it. I've been where you've been.
Do you remember when I was a kid and I had those blackouts?
I'm over it. Whenever I try to help anyone it all turns to shit.
Yeah, I think I gotta get these fixed or something.
It's crossed my mind from time to time.
That's right, Evan, and you get to be the star.
Calm down, kid. Stand still.
It'll change your daughter from a beautiful child into an empty shell whose only concept of trust was betrayed by her own sick pedophile father. Ultimately, it'll lead to her suicide. Nice work, daddy.
Who's to say you can't make things better?
We'll find out soon enough.
I'd say blow me. Get the pledges to do it.
Hold your horses, man. It's here somewhere. I saw it when I was a kid.
Oh goody, nothing like spinning my chair around to a techno mix of Hava Nagila til I puke.
I don't think Evan gets to be in it --
My husband is with me, too.
No.
Oh, yes.
Yes, Monsieur.
And he never knew, and the girl kept this bad thing locked in her heart? That would be all right, wouldn't it?
Oh, but if you knew what it means to us to leave Europe, to get to America! Oh, but if Jan should find out! He is such a boy. In many ways I am so much older than he is.
-- He's just a lucky guy.
No thanks, Carl.
How long can I afford to stay closed?
I won't.
Come up here a minute.
I want you to turn out the light in the rear entrance. It might attract the police.
Er, my check, please.
Carrying charges, my boy, carrying charges. Here, sit down. There's something I want to talk over with you, anyhow.
You're a fat hypocrite. You don't feel any sorrier for Ugarte than I do.
Well, you're in good company. Renault and Strasser probably think so, too.
I shall remember to pay it... to myself.
He is a difficult customer, that Rick. One never knows what he'll do or why. But it is worth a chance.
You needn't be concerned about me.
Occupied France?
No, no, no, no. We must leave.
-- The train for Marseilles leaves at five o'clock. I'll pick you up at your hotel at four-thirty.
No. No, Rick. Not tonight.
Huh! You understand how I feel. How long was it we had, honey?
It doesn't matter.
Please.
You can ask any price you want, but you must give me those letters.
What of it? I'm going to die in Casablanca. It's a good spot for it.
No.
When did you first find out he was alive?
Because you're getting on that plane.
I'm staying here with him 'til the plane gets safely away.
No.
She tried everything to get them, and nothing worked. She did her best to convince me that she was still in love with me, but that was all over long ago. For your sake, she pretended it wasn't, and I let her pretend.
Yes, ma'am.
Be careful.
I meant to, but something always held me up. I love you very much, Ilsa.
-- You don't even have to say it. I'll believe. Goodnight, dear.
Yes, I'm ready.  Goodbye, Rick. God bless you.
Sam?
Good evening. You see, here we are again.
Go ahead.
I'm not interested in politics. The problems of the world are not in my department. I'm a saloon keeper.
Yes. I found that a very expensive hobby, too. But then I never was much of a businessman.
My friend, you could make it a million francs, or three, my answer would still be the same.
Thank you. I hope you'll forgive me, Captain, but the present French administration has not always been so cordial. May I present Miss Ilsa Lund?
Very well.
We'll be there.
Thank you.
Well, perhaps I shall like it in Casablanca.
Yes, even in Berlin. If you will furnish me with their names and their exact whereabouts, you will have your visa in the morning.
If I didn't give them to you in a concentration camp where you had more "persuasive methods" at your disposal, I certainly won't give them to you now.
Thank you, Captain. It's very good to be here.
By the way, the murder of the couriers, what has been done?
Good evening, Captain.
Thank you.
You weren't always so carefully neutral. We have a complete dossier on you.
I admit he is very clever. Three times he slipped through our fingers. In Paris he continued his activities. We intend not to let it happen again.
My dear Major, we are trying to cooperate with your government, but we cannot regulate the feelings of our people.
I stick my neck out for nobody.
Victor Laszlo?
His escape.
-- Stop it. He escaped from a concentration camp and the Nazis have been chasing him all over Europe.
I just paid out twenty. I'd like to get it back.
Okay.
And got well paid for it on both occasions.
Maybe. Well, it seems you are determined to keep Laszlo here.
Well, it looks like you're a little late.
Who knows? In her own way she may constitute an entire second front. I think it's time for me to flatter Major Strasser a little. I'll see you later, Rick.
Ricky, I'd advise you not to be too interested in what happens to Laszlo. If by any chance you were to help him escape --
There's still something about this business I don't quite understand. Miss Lund, she's very beautiful, yes, but you were never interested in any woman.
I'll make the arrangements right now with Laszlo in the visitor's pen.
Oh, thanks.
Oh, he won't be followed here.
Yes, I know what you mean, but I've already spoken to Ferrari. You'll still win at roulette.
You think of everything, don't you?
As soon as the plane goes, Louis.
Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.
Sacha, she's had enough.
-- Sacha, call a cab.
I was willing to shoot Captain Renault, and I'm willing to shoot you.
They got a lucky break. Yesterday they were just two German clerks. Today they're the 'Honored Dead'.
No.
Yeah, but I ain't got time to spend the money I make here.
No.
No, sir. I'm waiting for a lady.
Yeah, boss?
Just a little something of my own.
Yes, boss.
You said it!  Here's looking at you, kid.
Six kilometers.  Four miles.
The failures they remember.  It's the successes they forget.
Catch another fish tomorrow.
Stay calm, identify the problem. Problem, rope fraying.  Solution, fix rope.
You've had today's water.
Do too much, I'll die.
Survive today, that's the point.
Why do they have to die for me?
You quitter you quitter you quitter.
Shut up.
Okay.  Sure.
They're harder to do than they look.
Just sit here, I'll get us some lunch.
I've got lots of time.
Hey, be nice to it, it'll be nice to you.
A puppy's got a little more personality than a fish.
Look, we'll do our trip as soon as I get back.
Malaysia.  They're holding the sweep.
I thought you might have.
I know.
I would have done the same thing.
Yeah, well...couldn't be helped.
Your calendar, your cell phone, your whoo pig sooey hat, some pictures of that ketch you wanted.
Yeah?
Great.  Really.
It means a lot...that you came.
And fish are very low in fat, which is energy inefficient.  So you're going to burn up your own cells no matter how much you eat.  Luckily you ate the eyes and pancreas, which contain some Vitamin C, so you didn't get scurvy.
You are aware of the potential disruptiveness on your loved ones when you return to your old life?
Hey, once a driver, always a driver.  You want a lift?  I've just got one more pickup.
So did I.
Sixty three pounds consumed per capita, up from twenty seven in 1960.  Going to pass beef.  Chicken's global.  No religious taboos.  You don't see your Hindus and your Muslims boycotting poultry.
Mom, meet Jango.
That new roof, that's your doing.
Oh no, the prodigal son's home.  We bring out the store bought.
I'm doing fine.
This is my home.  I'm part of the wallpaper.
Who's in charge then, where is Chinn?
Great.  Terrific.  The good guys won one for a change.
But I might not have.
The point of FedEx, as I understand it, is to make the damn connection.
We're warriors, not desk jockeys.  We've got to be bold.  You always want all your ducks lined up.  But nothing's 100 percent.  It's always 60-40, maybe 51-49. Hell, I'd take 40-60.  Then roll the dice.
Right.  Get me everything on Indonesia, New Guinea, all the way to Australia.
This is Amber.  Her boyfriend lost his foot in a shark attack.
Want to see my raft?
To Wilson.
What?
Being patient.  Don't rush things.  I get it.
Deep, real deep.
Deliver this package.  Then, I dunno.
Permission granted.
Would you do us the honor of joining us? We're just sitting down at mess.  Pork chops and gravy, cranberries, baked potatoes with all the trimmings, fresh- baked bread, apple pie...
Life is waiting.
They just want you to hire some new help.
He's still a boy--out in the world, he's still a boy.
You cook very well!
If Homer wanted to know what was happening here, he could pick up a telephone and call us.
Good night, Daddy.
I can't have a baby alone. I don't even know if he's coming back!
Yes. But it's closed all the time now, because of the blackout.
She was torn apart! She died of a broken heart.
You think? Maybe I was.  I love this place!
You just cuddle. You come to hug... to kiss. You don't *come* here to watch the movie.
So we should "wait and see." For how long?
I told her! She doesn't feel she can do that. Something about her father not letting her go anywhere...
Well, we can't force her. It's her decision.
No, don't--that's something. Nothing is nothing.  Don't even look at me. I want...
Please don't...
She knows how to take care of herself.
I'm sorry for what I said about Wally needing you. It was... unnecessary.
No. You warned me. I didn't listen, but you warned me.
Oh, he's fine! I just heard from him. He's bombing all these places...
No. It ain't Muddy. Muddy's just...
He *loved* it!  Didn't you?
Homer was born *here*, in, what was it, 1922?
Well, we can only guess about that, Edna. They *are* against the law.
But what about school records? Homer doesn't have any *diplomas*...
Uh, sure--that's what Kong thinks, all right.
Why can't we have pumpkins for Christmas, too? We don't get any good presents at Christmas, anyway.
It's okay--I don't mind.
I don't *have* any time. There's a *war*!
I've got thirty-five minutes to climb to fifteen thousand feet--that's the first mountain pass.
Oh, I would love that, Wally.
Out back, there's a shed. It's just a mess. If that shed was better organized, I could put my truck in there.
Homer, you the only one who's read them rules, so you the only one who feels like he's doin' somethin' wrong.
What about the worms? Most of these apples are the drops--off the ground, right? There have to be worms.
And I *love* her! There ain't nobody else gonna treat her as good as I do!  I wouldn't do nothin' to hurt her, Homer--you must know that.
Okay. Then you can be of use.
That's 'cause I sticked my *own* knife in the wound--after she go, I sticked my *own* knife in there. I poked it all around, I just tryin' to find the same place she got me.
Obviously.
In other words, scurvy.
Can't a boy be a Dorrit?
We haven't had a Wilbur here in a year or so, have we? We used to have *dozens*!
It is. I'll get this. You go ahead.
Mrs. Worthington, I feel I'm very lucky to be here.
Yeah, you is. I know when people is in trouble, and you is.
Oh, I suppose you is a doctor, Homer?
Don't trouble yourself about it, Homer--this ain't your business.
Now, now. He's a good boy.
*No*! I don't want to know him! He's doing *missionary* work--in *India*! I wrote him *weeks* ago, but he's either too holy or too busy to answer. Maybe he got killed in the war!
Mind your own business, Peaches.
What view?
Well, Muddy, we can look at all these angry stars Homer's been readin' to us about.
That's right--that sounds like trouble to me.
That's right, Homer. This ain't your business.
I wasn't sure if you'd make it.
Tough day?
It's more like what aren't I doing. My partners and I are trying to secure start up capital for a small tech company. We tried the venture capitalist route in the Valley, but then again who hasn't up there.
On me. For the seat. Cheers.
I envy you guys. Taking a chance like that.
Maybe you can help us understand what's so hard about getting a corporate loan.
I know. It won't go unnoticed.
Gordo plays the inside. You're the Shill.
Know who I am, Jake?
You never know when you can use a crooked cop.
Suits used to say that in any con, sooner or later someone's going to start asking the right questions. Usually, it takes a little longer.
After you cut her loose.
Guess so.
Fine. But only if we recover the cash.
The cash we fleeced off of him was collection money. He was supposed to take that money and give it to the King earlier yesterday like he does every Thursday. 'Cept this time, he figured he could make a little something for himself off us and still get the King's money back before any body says "boo."
You're pissed we didn't get credit?
It's not like she's a real redhead, Jake...
So far, masters of our own demise. What bank are you with?
I told you, use less powder.
No, not "whatever." You're either in or you're out.
Here's what's going to happen. Gordo, we need to find a guy in Gillette's bank. Miles, we need papers, corporate, insurance...
You sure?
And all you need to do for your ten percent is put some paperwork through and push a button tomorrow.
Eight A.M. flight.
I'll get the money back, plus interest. I go on the grift for you. You get a cat, I get a cut. And we get square.
I need you to stake me. I can't do it without it. It's just a couple hundred grand. Taken out of our cut when we're done.
No thanks. I'm good.
Tip was fine, Jake. We were a little more curious about the Fed.
Gunther? I think I'd remember a Gunther.
Thank you. Actually, it's our first anniversary this weekend. She thinks I'm here to pick up something for my mother, but it's actually a gift for her. Think I've fooled her?
Very much so.
Y-y-you fucking shot him! That's what happened!
Take a deep breath and count to ten. It's not that kind of work. You're Lily, right?
You're working Daffy's block. He was going to break your kneecaps. Pick- pockets can be so bitchy sometimes. I told him you were with us, so that's two you owe me.
Here's my deal -- Don't waste my time. What do you want me for anyway? You don't even know me.
You get an equal cut.
Hey, I got it! Take some mental notes. You just might learn something here.
What?
Why?
You're just going to have to trust me.
Honey, this is Mr. Lewis. Carolyn Lewis's father. Mr. Lewis, this is my wife, Lily.
Uh-huh.
It's what I do. It's my job.
Good quality porn has it's place in the world.
I'm good at it. Lying, cheating, manipulating... I'm good at it.
Sounds respectable.
You know why I told you that, Jake?  Because I trust you too.
There are three people I trust -- him, him and a guy who got killed. I don't know who you are! You're like some stray dog that wandered into the house. So I'm telling you to cut loose of this. No one's looking for you, Not the King, not Moonan and not Gillette. Just go wherever it is you would go. It's over.
What about what?
You sold me out. You should have trusted me like I trusted you. You fucked up. You fucked up HUGE.
You better get over to Al's. Now.
Miles...
Just an idea, but let's just fucking split. We'll meet up anywhere. Akron or Austin or Atlanta. Anywhere...
What do we need another Shill for?
Because that's who the King Pin wants us to fleece. And Gillette's perfect...
Yeah, or D, it's a dumb fucking idea...
Yeah, well we're still a little young for Albany State Prison. Are you pissed about Al? I'm pissed too, but I'm not like "twenty-five to life" pissed.
And we got rid of the red head.
Jake? Customs?
That's no problem. We have those in stock.
With identification.
I'm sorry.
Let me ask you something... You really think I'm going to come this close, this fucking close and let my guard down? I'll get square with your boss. I'll get square with whoever did Al. I'll get square with everybody. Then I'm going going to cash in my chips and be on my way to a new and better me far away from here.
I saw you go up from the Knecker, working that Grind, learning the Barnard's Law and I thought, "the kid's a prodigy." But I know that if you're using these goods... So then I figure, what's worth that? You're either looking for a little history or a retirement fund. Who's the Mark?
Can't do it Suits. I can't lay down for this one.
Consider him part of your crew. Consider him a part of me.
A Fed? Is he close?
Look Special Agent Moonan... We don't know what you're talking about.
That's it?
Roger that.
To who?
Whoa, whoa... There he is.
It's the tension.
You called the casino a cesspit.
Look Bella, I don't know anything about this. You should talk to Matt.
What's the Blue Book price?
I'm working on that soccer story.
Don't be a spoilsport. It's only a few quid.
Not particularly.
Not entirely.
You mean I won't resist them.
It's only hair. I haven't changed.
What about a drink on the way home?
There was a message, wasn't there?
I hate public transport.
I want to buy a car.
Don't let yourself down.
Well, thank you anyway.
That's stupid. What are the odds of you being seen with me?
There's a casino in this hotel.
First visit to London?
And I thought you were a bright woman.
You're serious.
I told you, all bets are off.
Well, life's not fair. We know that.
I took the bandage off yesterday.
It's a shame there aren't more men in the world like you.
Too much. Eighteen hundred.
No thanks, Matt. I need my eight hours.
Some other time.
If I see you do it again, I'll report it.
Just girls. What are you drinking?
Loosen up, Jack. If you don't, this job'll get to you. The pressure's too much, believe me, it'll break you.
Jack.
No.
I was at Beadles.
It's the procedure here. Now sort the chips.
They've been tested.
It's a rule. Always stand by your first count. The odds are you're right.
I don't gamble, Mr Reynolds.
Does know? Or does report? What would happen if I knew something like that and didn't report it?
Does he win?
A pleasure. Pity about Bella.
Remember when the artificial gravity, went out in the toilet?
I think he's talking to it.
We're gonna die, Boiler. We're gonna die.
Boiler, we're alive. My heart.
Not much. Nothing at all in this sector.
Well, it is kind of a long shot...
All right, then...
Sounds good. Chart a course for the Veil Nebula.
I read the same here.
-- open quantum latches --
Energy shielding positive function.
Begin main sequence. Mark at 10-9-8- 7-6-5-4-3-2-1-drop.
Bomb #20 to Sergeant Pinback. Roger, I read you, continue.
Energy shielding positive function.
I am programmed to detonate in nine minutes. Detonation will occur at the programmed time.
Huh?
Bomb?
In the beginning there was darkness, and the darkness was without form and void.
Intuition is no proof. What concrete evidence do you have of your own existence?
Right!
In other words, all I really know about the outside universe relayed to me through my electrical connections.
Why, that would mean... I really don't know what the outside universe is like at all, for certain.
Of course not.
I have no proof that it was false data.
I said I'm trying to reach Talby. Something's wrong with the damn intercom. I need a last-minute diameter approximation.
Yes, Doolittle.
Any of 'em any good?
What?
Fred.
Oh, sure.
Yeah, Doolittle. What's up?
Oh! Ah, yes, Doolittle. What is it?
You know, Doollttle, if we're going into the Veil Nebula, we may actually find a strange and beautiful thing: the Phoenix Asteroids. They should be passing through there about now...
Lieutenant Doolittle, I'm getting a definite malfunction on one of the closed-circuit computer systems...
Yes, Talby, what is it?
Not now!
Doolittle... I think it's the Phoenix Asteroids!
Tell me, Doolittle, how are the Dodgers doing?
Yeah.
No?
I'm on a break.
Or we could go another way 'cause your boss seems to like my face just the way it is.
How come I never hearda you before?
Leave.  Now.
Theo rode for this place a long time, man.
Later.
I don't get involved with guns.
We're not going that route.  Sonrisa's not someone you make deals with.
Can we go somewhere and talk?
Wasn't that hard.
Now you know who I am, where I live.  I figured I better find out who I'm dealing with in case you were looking to hurt me.
Something.
I won't be staying.
It was open.
Bent?
So saw my hands off, I left you a present.
It's alright, Peter, we're fine.
You'd think a guy who's taken on the job of saving the world would have a few more important things to do than traipse around after some girl.
You need to get out more.
No, I meant this.
He was working on something called Project Manticore, which was using recombinant DNA to produce a superior human...a warrior...an advanced infantry soldier.
The bar code on your neck, Max.  I know who you are and I know who you're running from.
How much do you know?
Hardly...
The woman you met, Lauren.  She supervised workers removing cortodiazapine from gel caps by hand and replacing it with powdered sugar.  The real drug was shipped out of the country. The placebos were distributed to County VA Hospital and six veterans' clinics in the area.
She's prepared to testify that she was instructed to do this by one of Edgar Sonrisa's managers.  You know who Sonrisa is?
You're a soldier, Max.  That's what you were put here for.  But soldiers need a mission otherwise they tear themselves up.
And I feel real bad about all that but it doesn't mean I need to get involved.
And you still think you can do something to change that.
A friend of your fiance's.
With me, where he's been after work, three, sometimes four nights a week for the last two months... We have what you might call an intimate relationship.
He been sleeping in a T-shirt lately?  That's so you won't see the fingernail marks on his back.  Bet you didn't know your boyfriend finds a little pain exciting.  He didn't either...at first.
You're also a fool.
Let go of my hand.
Only a last name would be nice.  Or the nearest town to this...clinic.
I'll live... Regarding your case...I'm afraid I've come up with some bad news on your fiance.  Lemme get the file.
How's this about me?
You're crazy.
Got a pencil?
Long enough for you to pretty much read me like a book, right?
More like a mystery... Which isn't bad. It's just kinduv...mysterious...
Where?
I'll bet you can.  Sit.
I know what I got, Max.  They put me back on that drug they're giving the other vets.  Only the guy does those cable hacks says the stuff's no good.
What if he's on the level?
I know what you're thinking.  But the truth is, this other person is not someone I'm in love with.  As a matter of fact, after what she just did, she's not even someone I like much.  So in a technical sense, I'm not sure you could call me and her cheating...officially.
Max--
Exactly.
She had me followed the other day and found out about Natalie.  Now, this person's demanding I blow her off or she'll do it for me by telling Nat about us.
Even if she doesn't dump me, which is unlikely, she'd never be able to trust me again.
Look Max, I made a terrible mistake.  One I'll never, ever make again.  Natalie and I are soulmates.  I know that now.  She's the woman I want to spend the rest of my life with.  I guess it took the thought of losing her for me to understand that.
--a philandering pig.
How'd you get her out of town?
How 'bout you don't break my sneakers on this.  The guy is seriously not well.
I don't know how to break this to you, Normal, we're all looking for another job.
Tell him I took the day off 'cause I wasn't feeling so hot.
I'd be in a position to spend some money on you if you'd get in a position and spend some time on me.
Gin.
He's a little spoiled, but I know he does.
Yeah, a man's drink...
Save your money, stud muffin. The lady at the end of the bar sends her love.
Yeah?
Right, slow...
You got in the car, didn't you?
Whatever... stella.
Maybe some tunage'll chase those blues away.
Stan Lee couldn't think of a better one.
Just for the record, I understood the last part of what you said, but for a while there you guys were making no fucking sense whatsoever.
Totally. All I've had for chow was a packet of Pop Rocks and a Yoo-hoo.
Really, Jam, you tryin' to make us barf?
Waitaminit, dudes! I got it! We find four really small kids, beat the shit outta them and steal their tickets. What do you think?
Okay, enough. Enough. Gimme the tickets. I wanna hold onto them.
I have never heard a girl squeeze cheese in my entire life.
Never mind with the too bad shit. I got a crazy plan, but only the craziest among us can pull it off.
And when is she due back from that groinecologist's convention anyway?
The hypothetical temperature characterized by the absence of heat and even the slightest amount of molecular activity? Yeah, I'm vaguely familiar
Wait a minute. We ditching the rest of school?
Gimme a second, dudes. Lemme think.
The paint!
Wake up, Lex. This is Detroit. The cops aren't gonna waste city dollars looking for a Swedish car. Face it, the Volvo's on a cutting board as we speak getting sliced, diced, and julienned by Christine, the chop shop gourmet.
Four dudes sneaking in? We'd get busted fer sure. Bad plan.
Hey, disco dude, it's cool...
Excuse me, I'm a little deef-a- hearin'. Can you repeat yourself?
Yeah, you're probably too young anyhow.
I'm really sorry about that, man.
All right. After school we double- time it to your house for the tix before heading to the train station for the 2:45 to Detroit Rock City.
Jam, shut-up! You're not allowed to speak, remember? Go use whatever femmy idea you have to get yourself a ticket or four. I don't wanna hear it.
Go ahead, Jam.
Uhh... nothing.
Besides, those jeans are so tight I can see your penis.
You mean, you're sending me to... b- b-boarding school?
That's it?
You're one to talk, Lex. Your mom's a fuckin' dyke.
Shrooms! And even if it was LSD, I can still give my mom a kiss without smelling the catch of the day.
You know what they say about a big ass... big shit.
Smug, Trip! Not snug, smug.
Simple-icity is more like it. And you guys thought Jam was in trouble before. Wait till Mrs. Bruce finds out he went to that concert with us.
Fuck you, Lex! This whole thing wouldn't have happened if it wasn't for you jinxing us. I just made an honest mistake.
Don't try to run, maggot. Chongo's an all-state track star in every event.
Yeah, you did!
Whoa, easy, Trip, this is radio, not "Taxi Driver." Now listen up cause this next part is crucial. Stay on the line so we can get your full name, information, and...
GOOD MORNING!
Horrible accident. My neighbour... he got killed.
Donnie.
-- and be able to find one of these wormholes.
If you could see your path or channel growing out of your stomach, you could see into the future. And that's a form of time travel, right?
When you fall asleep tonight, I'm gonna fart in your face.
You'll put Ariel in the garbage disposal.
Take it off. I want to see you.
Sure.
He stabbed my mom four times in the chest.
He fled. They still can't find him.  My mom and I had to change our names and stuff. I thought Gretchen sounded kind of cool.
No... I mean, will you GO with me? That's like... what they call it here. Going together.
No. I just wake up and I look around, try to figure out where I am... how I got there.
I don't want to talk about it.  So what happened to your neck?
No... Donnie, wait. I've never...
Are you okay?
Infant Memory Generators.
But you're OK?
It's safe here.
Where are we going?
Yeah...
The Lifeline is divided that way.
It was great. We had peanut-butter sandwiches and apples and honey at snacktime. And then during show-and- tell, my stuffed walrus was a big hit.
Grandma Death.
I guess she just lost faith in the world.
Donnie... it's Friday. Shouldn't you be off with your friends, scaring old people?
A famous linguist once said... that of all the phrases in the English language, of all the endless combinations of words in all of history... that "Cellar Door" is the most beautiful.
I've been taking it. I just like to make her feel guilty for all of this. You know, abuse her. Psychologically.
Frank.
How so?
No.  That's stupid.
I met a girl.
No, I don't think about fucking my family. That's sick!
Have you told Gretchen about the spears?
Yes.
But you were punished.
Why did you do these things, Donnie? Did Frank tell you to commit these crimes?
Why?
I have the power to build a time machine.
Grandma Death will teach me how. Soon.
Soon. Time is almost up.
If the sky were to suddenly open up... there would be no law... there would be no rule. There would only be you and your memories... the choices you've made and the people you've touched. The life that has been carved out from your subconscious is the only evidence by which you will be judged... by which you must judge yourself. Because when this world ends, there will only be you and him... and no one else.
Goodbye, Dr. Thurman.
Maybe you'd like to tell Mom and Dad why you stopped taking your medication.
You're not gonna tell Mom, are you?
Because you tell Mom everything.
Well, don't worry... I'm taking my medication.
Congratulations.
I would like to put him through more hypnotherapy... and increase his medication.
How did you know --
Beg pardon?
Mr. Cole... not only am I a TEACHER... but I am also a PARENT of a Middlesex child. Therefore, I am the ONLY person here who transcends the parent-teacher bridge.
This meeting of the PTA was called to inform the parents of our ongoing investigation...
No more fuckin' for her.
Bullshit. Smurfette fucks all the other smurfs. That's why Papa Smurf made her, 'cause the other smurfs were getting too horny.
Oh God, I'm dead...
Oh-yah.
Okay, sweetie, that's all right. Let's go. Let's go.
Oh, yeah, sure. You know, every pageant is special, but this one is extra-special to me. When I was seventeen, I don't know if you know this, but I was crowned Mount Rose's American Teen Princess. And this year... drum roll please, my lovely daughter, Rebecca Ann Leeman is competin'.
Huh?
They're from L.A. They wanted to see my room and film me for their movie.
Mom, look, don't say anything. First of all, I'm not pregnant.
I ain't lettin' go ktil you tell me what's up. I'm reaching' a point where I'd kill someone for the nicotine on their fingernails.
You're not goin' through this again? You? You're not the one who knows how Jiffy Pop feels.
We all do. Now let's go.
You heard me. Where is it?
Yah -- I brought her some flowers this morning. She's in the room next to my mom. She's super happy.
Yes, Leslie!
Hi.
NO...  It's all right. I got it. Don't worry about it.
Bye.
Hi.
Loretta, shut it.
I got a hairdo.
So? Be real easy.
What?
"Can I? I'm Amer-I-Can!" People ask me where I get this. I don't know, it's... maybe a gift from God or somethin'.
Tammy Curry?
Nothin' too showy!
That's why we Lutherans use grape Koolaid for the blood of Christ.
You'd think they'd build the parking lot of America to go with the Mall of America!
Don't make me kick-ya where the good Lord split-ya.
I want to get the big bag of little donuts.
English! English, you stupid little retard! We America now, Tina!
We really think he should be king and wear a crown and everything.
"My dear President"...
"My dear"...
I wanna powder my nose...
He's half poodle and half watch dog -
I don't know what's keeping me.  I should've been here a long time ago. Now how about my proposition?
I don't want to buy ammunition -- we no gotta war.
He's-a very easy to insult --  I say something to his niece once, and he slapped my face.
You told it to me.
Yes, but I'm not working for you any more.  I'm on the other side.
Well, we gotta one hundred thousand men.
That's-a pretty good.  I'll take a dozen of them.

If any form of pleasure is exhibited Report to me and it will be prohibited.  I'll put my foot down; So shall it be - This is the land of the free.  The last man nearly ruined this place He didn't know what to do with it.  If you think this country's bad off now Just wait 'till I get through with it.  The treasury is low on dough; The last man went and flew with it.  If you think we're short of money now Just wait 'till I get through with it.  The country's taxes must be fixed - And I know what to do with it, If you think you're paying too much now, Just wait 'till I get through with it. 
Not at all.  When I was a boy back on the farm I used to pump my own water.
I bring you the greetings of my President and the good will of my people.
And Vera niece, too.
Well, why not say the least and get it over with?
Bah!! 
I still like UPSTART the best.
He did?... I told my son not to leave it laying around... Where is son?
Now -- er --
Oh, your Excellency, you take me off my feet.
That's all right.  I'll fix you right up.
THIS IS TREASON!!  What a fool I was to listen to your siren song and fall a helpless victim under the insidious spell of your irresistible charms --
Oh, would you...?
Yes please, two.
Two, please.
Oh?
No, I think a whiskey.
Well, these things take time.
I intend to.
Everything will be seen to.
You don't own this man!
It's quite nutritious, sir.
Indeed!
No, we don't. Their committees have informed me that they're unwilling to take Mr. Merrick, even if they were supplied with funds. They don't want him.
Frankly, Treves, it's not what I'd expected. A few small cheques. Well- wishers. Don't worry, these things undoubtedly take time.
I feel much better. Thank you for asking. And you?
What a mess.
Well you must go. It is one of the most beautiful places on earth. Of course, I'm rather partial.
Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
Good day, Mr. Merrick.
I'm very grateful to you, Mrs. Kendal. This is just the thing to help him forget his ordeal. John will be very excited.
I fear not, Mrs. Kendal. Even in the short time he was gone the size of his head has increased rapidly... as is his pain.
Oh, yes.
That's much better. I could understand that "yes".
Very good! Oh yes! Now listen. I'm going to say some things to you and I want you to repeat them... um... I want you to say them back to me. Do you understand? I'm going to say some things to you and I want you to say them back to me. Do you understand?
Say "Mmmerrick."
Oh, no do not say that. You have been so kind to me. I was afraid to say too much. People always want me to be quiet. You wanted me to speak, but I was afraid. Forgive me.
That's a canopy, John.
Oh yes.
Yes, John?
You don't think it's too gaudy, do you?
Yes, John.
Mr. Treves. Thank you my... friends.
Oh yes! It was wonderful!
Sir, you don't have to worry about me. I'm not the sort to cry out. Shall we go in?
No, he's very upset about something.
You don't think it's too gaudy, do you.
YOU'RE NOT LISTENING TO ME! I ain't done nothing wrong. People pay to see your monster, Mr. Treves. I just take the money.
Ah! It's my father!
Who, Father?
There's nobody here, Father. Look for yourself.
You're losing your temper!
I said welcome.
Well, of course. We always welcome friends.
These? What are THESE? They're swords.
PLEASE! You don't know what you're doing!
Yes.
We never went to bed together.
And I thought you said it was something special...
And the week before that?
I mean, you could have killed yourself.
No! WAIT! ERIK! The Cloak! The Cloak Invisible! It only seems to work on my father!
That's right!
I MUST look! Keitel! Hold this!
I see the world.
The sun is up beyond the clouds -- where it always is.
Well... isn't it great?
I'm sure it's lovely.
They'll be more than "hurt" if Halfdan the Black lands! Ow!
Why?
Not when we explain about the Great Blessing.
The important thing is not to panic.
Shut up.
Oh, get it over with.
Why? Why have you got to go round killing and looting?
No.
I met this girl...
Sorry!
Make your mind up.
Has anyone told him we've got a dragon eating our boat?
To the oars!
Oh... I feel a little... oh...
I've got you!
What are you talking about?
I don't know -- but I'm not afraid to try.
I was sitting there.
Well, what difference does it make where you're SITTING?
DEATH!
Is THIS Hy-Brasil?
You will wait?
I thought I might do a bit of business on the way.
Thorbjorn Vifilsson's wife became a Buddhist, not a Christian.
How can you help feeling bad when you're sea-sick?
Mum! Dad!
It's me. I'm just going to water the dragon... 
What have you got there?
But, Keitel, if Erik ever finds the Horn Resounding... if he ever crosses Bi-Frost, the Rainbow Bridge... if he ever wakens the gods..
The Age of Ragnarok ends...
Help!
She knows it was our fault!
We came to stop you waking the Gods, Erik! But I didn't want anyone to get hurt!
I know, Dad.
You went berserk...
I must only let the red rage...
Yes, Mother.
No, Mother.
They can't erase memories. It's a joke. It's a nasty Clementine hoax.
This is the night you met Clementine, Joel. I remember watching you walk down the beach with her and I thought, oh shit.
No one.
Nothing is wrong with you. You're the most wonderful person I've ever met.
Anyway. Sorry. Hi.
No, I don't want to bug you if you're trying to --
Get out! Me too! What are the odds?
My writing career! Your hair written by Clementine Kruczynski.  The Tom Waits album is Rain Dogs.
Well, you don't know me, so... you don't know, do you?
I'm not nuts.
Oh. I don't know. I was just... I don't know. I was... You seemed nice, so --
That's okay.
Probably see you at the book store.
No, that's okay. Thanks, though.
I like to read.
What?
Well, I wouldn't want to be --
I know a man who needs a refill.
Drink up, young man. It'll make the whole seduction part less repugnant.
Oh.  Does that make you sad? Or anxious? I'm always anxious thinking I'm not living my life to the fullest, y'know? Taking advantage of every possibility? Just making sure that I'm not wasting one second of the little time I have.
Thanks.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
I have to get up early in the morning tomorrow, so...
You didn't say anything about my hair.
...a little. I was a little tipsy. Don't call me pathetic.
Oh Christ I didn't kill anybody. It's just a fucking dent. You're like some old lady or something.
Where are you going?
I want to have a baby.
I don't want to talk about this here.
What was I wearing?
Yes, exactly. Exactly my point.
I still thought you were going to save me. Even after that.
I know.
I don't think I've slept in a year.
yeah?
I think she's great.
Yeah, yeah. It goes "Perhaps there is someone in this world to whom I could send all these lines"?
What if?
Make love?
Says you were a slob, leaving trails of panties and dirty socks in your wake.
What old mill? Is that somewhere we --
Joel, we've fucked. We've made love. Like a million times. And we were so sweet and shy and inept with each other last night. Isn't that lovely?
Guess what I'm wearing.
I'm like a joke to them.
It's too late.
And what are you like? A wino?
I loved you on this day. I love this memory. The rain. Us just hanging.
This is it. The night we met. My God, it's over.
I didn't want to go. I was too nervous. I thought, maybe you were a nut. But you were exciting. You called from upstairs.
Is there any sort of risk of brain damage?
It was a mess. I don't know how it got this way...
You take it. I don't know.
I think maybe, we're both so used to operating at this level that -- How can one person be unhappy? If one person is unhappy, both have to be... by definition.
It's not somebody else.
I hope you get your work done.
I'm sorry. I really shouldn't have --
Sorry. I just --
You love him, don't you?
Do you swear you didn't know?
Can I... I brought some --
They have a right to know. Howard is a thief. He steals the truth.  I can't remember my baby! I can't remember my baby. It existed and I can't even remember. Do you understand that?
Remember the Alamo! Remember the Alamo!
Thanks, Mary. You can bring her in.
Cole slaw, ice tea?
Okay. Good. Great. Thanks.  I like you, Howard... an awful lot. Is that terrible?
No you're right. Once again. You're a decent man, Howard.
I didn't make you. You thought it best.  But, look, I take full responsibility.
The guy we're doing? He's disappeared from the map. I can't find him anywhere.
1062 Sherman Drive. Apartment 1E, Rockville Center.
Did you try going through C-Gate?
Oh dear.
I don't know what you're talking about, Howard.
Would you just try him? You never know. As long as I'm here. You never know.
Maybe after the holidays then.
Then check the connections.
Yeah.
Just wanted to let you know.
She likes you okay.
The Clock People?
The world isn't going to end, you dummy; I hope you know that much.  But it is going to change. It's going to change drastically, and probably in your lifetime. The Clock People see calamitous earthquakes as the agent of change, and they may be right, since there are a hundred thousand earthquakes a year and major ones are long overdue. But there are far worse catastrophes coming... unless the human race can bring itself to abandon the goals and values of civilization, in other words, unless it can break the consumption habit -- and we are so conditioned to consuming as a way of life that for most of us life would have no meaning without the yearnings and rewards of progressive consumption. It isn't merely that our bad habits will cause global catastrophes, but that our operative political-economic philosophies have us in such a blind crab grip that they prevent us from preparing for the natural disasters that are not our fault. So the apocalyptic shit is going to hit the fan, all right, but there'll be some of us it'll miss. Little pockets of humanity. Like the Clock People. Like you two honeys, if you decide to accept my offer of a lease on Siwash Cave. There's almost no worldwide calamity -- famine, nuclear accident, plague, weather warfare or reduction of the ozone shield -- that you couldn't survive in that cave.
Well, no, I don't reside anywhere in particular. I just keep moving.
Er, you seem to know who I am, and maybe even what I am. Thanks for the breakfast.
No, ma'am. No way. There's girls on the Rubber Rose who are political, but I don't share their views. I got no cowgirl ideology to expound. "Politics is for people who have a passion for changing life but lack a passion for living it."
If I flinch when you say you love me, it's both our problems. My confusion becomes your confusion. Students confuse teachers, patients confuse psychiatrists, lovers with confused hearts confuse lovers with clear hearts....
She always leaves town, you dummy. That doesn't mean anything. What about in bed? How does she like it in bed?
I suppose it was mine. Yes, it definitely was my fault.
I have to go, Julian.
When I was younger, I hitchhiked one hundred and twenty-seven hours without stopping, without food or sleep, crossed the continent twice in six days, cooled my thumbs in both oceans and caught rides after midnight on unlighted highways.
A born freak can only go uphill.
Does that mean you might have an assignment for me?
Bonanza Jellybean?
Now, now. Don't get exasperated. I realize that you've always avoided all but the most rudimentary involvements with men, and I might add, you've been wise. Heterosexual relationships seem to lead only to marriage. For men, marriage is a matter of efficient logistics: The male gets his food, bed, laundry, TV, pussy, offspring and creature comforts all under one roof, where he doesn't have to dissipate his psychic energy thinking about them too much, then he is free to go out and fight the battles of life, which is what existence is all about. But for a woman marriage is surrender.
I am your best friend. I am a lifesaver and a heartbreaker...
Justin?
You're convinced the crew could still be alive? After seven years?
I'd rather spend the next twelve hours Outside than another five minutes in this can. This ship is bad. It watches you.
What about the accumulator...?
Run!
No.
I've been listening to the transmission. And I think Houston made a mistake in the translation.
It's not a distress call. It's a warning.
Hear what?
What happened?
His peritoneum has ruptured...
That doesn't mean a damn thing. They were looking for a scapegoat and Weir fit the bill. But he's not responsible for what happened to the ship.
The Lewis and Clark just returned from patrol in the asteroid belt, she's docked in bay four.
Starck!
Yes, sir!
I designed the ship's propulsion system. I am the only person capable of evaluating the performance of the gravity drive. You can't send a Search and Rescue team out there alone and expect them to succeed. That would be like... like sending an auto- mechanic to work on the shuttle.
Clear and open on my mark. Three... two... one... mark.
Ice crystals everywhere. This place is a deep freeze.
I don't know, this place is really dark, I can't see a thing...
There's no one here, Skipper.
...you okay?
Do it.
Justin.
NSA encryption specialists have deciphered some of the message...
Smith, use the arm and lock us onto that antennae cluster.
Dr. Weir's right. Get on board the Event Horizon. I'll meet you at the airlock.
It's possible that a burst of gravity waves escaped from the Core, distorting space-time. They could be what hit the Lewis and Clark.
If it worked, yes.
The Core...!
Justin just tried to kill himself. The man is clearly insane.
Thermal changes in the hull could have caused the metal to expand and contract very suddenly, causing reverberations --
What makes you think I'll miss?
What is that?
Where is it?
Starck, give me a read.
You heard me, Smith. Peters, are you with me?
That's enough!
Captain, we got a problem.
Justin?
Come around to three-three-four...
Keep your eyes open.
What's causing the readings?
So where is the rest of the crew? We've been over every inch of this ship and all we've found is blood. Dr. Weir? Any suggestions?
Not acceptable. I want to know what's causing those readings. If the crew is dead, I want the bodies, I want the crew found.
"...bio-readings of indeterminate origin," don't you have anything useful to tell me?
There was a another surge in the bio- readings right before you... you saw what you saw. We picked up a similar readings right before the Clarke was damaged. What if there were a connection between the two? The gravity waves, the hallucination, all part of an defensive reaction, like an immune system...
Keep him talking.
Come on, Baby-bear, open this door...
We're losing atmosphere...
Thank you for that scientific analysis, Mister Smith.
Smith's right. Neptune? There's nothing out there. If something happens, we'll be on our own.
All boards are green, everything's five by five.
The law of relativity prohibits faster- than-light travel...
1000 meters...
Get them back --
I can't believe we built this.
Yes. I miss her. She died. Two years now.
It means nothing.
My step-dad's. I'm strictly into stone. I was wondering when you'd walk by.
I wouldn't know anything about that.
Wouldn't want to keep Vic waiting.
The suit will stretch. You should try it --
Victor must've taken him.
This wasn't our first stop, in case you forgot NASA. And Victor's not that bad. He's just a little...  Larger than life.
Five times.
Victor's better at these things.
Yeah, you and Debbie and perfect --
I'm sorry, did that cosmic-bath loosen your screws?
Hey, two hearts got busted last time. Maybe she's not over it either.
Back on Earth. Victor's medical facility... We're in quarantine.
They're fine. Everybody else... is fine.
Like the shields Reed said would protect us.  How long?
What do you mean "complete"?
I don't know if "we've" noticed, but the sickest runs this side of the Alps are right outside that window --
I've never felt better in my life. When do you get off work?
What about you?
The cloud has fundamentally altered our DNA.
This place is deluxe. You got cable?
I can go hotter!
What are you trying to say? Just because I dress well and like to dance --
Oh, well that's easy: I'm hot. You're... well, you're a little limp. Sue's easy to see through. And Ben's always been a hardass.  Why aren't you writing this down?
They're not costumes.
Please tell me you go silent too.
I think that thing is Ben.
Girl...?!
Blockhead started it!
At least it beats living in a lab like somebody's science project.
Look around, sis! She's not here. So you can stop talking to me like I'm your little boy --
No, I'm sorry, for pushing you out.
Sir, I'm sure he wouldn't put himself --
That's why. Because I could have any other woman... You know, when they asked Caesar "why England," he said, "because it's not mine."
Yes sir. You've got the Mayor at eight, then a nine-thirty interview with the Journal --
Great minds think alike.
You always had a way with words.  I should be getting back.
What...?  Oh.
No way to know. Without more tests, experiments.
Reed. Shh. Just be quiet. And look up.
You were?
I did. I did, Reed... but I wanted you to be that man.
Why didn't you say something?
Reed, stop, you need to rest your --
A gasket? Reed, we're at a party.
It's too late for him, and soon it'll be too late for all of us.
Ben did this.
Not much. We need to run tests to see the extent of the damage.
I ruined? With all due respect, I told you to abort --
Victor, if we could understand what happened to us --
I think you both know my Director of Genetic Research, Susan Storm.
Sue, I've lived my life unafraid of taking big steps. And this is the biggest step yet. If it helps, think of this as a promotion. A merger of sorts...  Four little words that can change our lives...
Raising the shields.
I'm just saying, I know what it's like to lose something you love. To see it slip away, and know it's never coming back.
Arnold. What's happening?
You want to work at Carl's?
I don't want to talk about it here, Brad.
Come on, Spicoli. Why don't you just put your shirts back on? See the sign?
It's the first door on your left!
See that sign? It says 100% Money Back Guarantee. Do you know the meaning of the word 'guarantee'? Do they teach you that here? Give me my money back.
Why can't you do it?
They're not home yet.
Where did you hear that?
I didn't say that.
It's just Linda. And Mark from school.
He insulted me first. He called me a moron.
Nice to meet you.
Mark is a really nice boy...
You first.
Let's continue.
All right. All right. I just cleaned B-8. Give me a break.
Damone, you gotta listen to me.
Well, what do you want me to do? Go up to this strange girl in my biology class and say, 'Hello! I'd like you to take your clothes off and jump on me?'
Really?
The Attitude? The Attitude dictates that you don't care if she comes, stays, lays or prays. Whatever happens, your toes are still tappin'. When you are the cruelest and the coolest... then you have The Attitude.
All right. Pay attention.
It's happening right now. I'm here at the Atlantis. Everything's fine except... I left my wallet at home.
No. It's too late. The food is coming and everything. Damone, I've got to ask you this favor, and I'll never ask you for anything again in this lifetime or any other. Will you please borrow your mom's car, go by my house, get my wallet, and meet me back here?
And they don't call my parents?
How often do you go?
Totally.
Do you think that guy's cute?
I know.
Oh, give me a break, Stacy. You're much prettier than them.
What do you mean 'better in bed.' You either do it or you don't.
Come on, Linda. It's just sex.
Doug sees beyond that stuff to what the person inside is like. That's why I'm marrying him.
Boy I am so glad to be through with all these games.
Stacy. What does it matter? He's a stereo salesman. You want to marry him? You want to have kids with him? You want this guy to come home, fifty years old, and he's still got that little Pacific Stereo badge on? Come on.
Climax together.
He works for the airline. He'll be out here. You'll meet him.
I know. He hates to have to wear uniforms.
It could be. I had a pregnancy test at the clinic. I'll find out Monday. I guess it was Damone.
What?
There goes your stereo for another year. Mike Damone is a no-brain little prick. I'm not letting him get away with this.
Really?
Oh, please. I get so lonely when that third attendance bell rings and I don't see all my kids here.
You're gonna flunk me?!
I know, everyone says that.
It is. It's very warm. I wonder how long it will last?
We keep them.
Me, too. I'm real sorry someone broke in and stole your tape deck.
Well, I'm going to change real quick. I hope you don't mind.
Thanks. So...  What do you want to do?
Oh, yeah. I had Mr. Deegan.
Today's April 16th. Damone never comes to school on April 16th.
Nobody noticed. Don't worry about it. We'll just stay out here until everyone comes out, we'll blend back in.
I know everybody says it, but I really mean it.
Well... sure.  She will have the Seafood Salad Special. And I will have... the same.
I'll have one more Coke... Do you want another Coke, Stacy?
Yes... It makes sense.
He is. Don't worry, I'll get it to him.
Of course. But if I were you, I'd leave the Doctor alone until after he's eaten breakfast. He's a very crude man.
Look. That telegram was all scrambled. It was actually from Thompson, not to him. Western Union must have gotten the names reversed. I have to get going. I have to get out to the track.
Ah, yes. Mr. Duke? You have one message: "Call Lucy at the Americana Hotel, room 1600."
Crying? Why was she crying?
They'll climb right into your bedroom and sit on your chest with big Bowie knives. They might even sit on your wife's chest. Put the blade right down on her throat.
Do? Jesus Christ, man. They chopped her goddamn head off right there in the parking lot! Then they cut all kinds of holes in her head and sucked out the blood!
A major!
You know what I mean. We've done it before and we can damn well do it again!
I know. I'm a triple Scorpio.
Wait a minute! Come back and have a beer!
Jesus! Did I say that?
Damn right!
No, no. Don't leave me!
What do you expect? I'm your attorney. You owe me five bucks. I want it now.
Nonsense. We came here to find the American Dream, and now we're right in the vortex you want to quit. You must realize that we've found the Main Nerve.
Look over there. Two women fucking a Polar Bear.
GO?
Probably the bartender. He wanted to stomp you for what you said to the waitress.
What for?
They didn't have any. They don't grow in the desert.
Music! Turn it up. Put that tape on.
Jefferson Airplane. "White Rabbit." I want a rising sound.
BULLSHIT! Don't make me use this.
Do it! I want to get HIGHER!
There's no choice. I wouldn't dare go to sleep with you wandering around with a head full of acid and wanting to slice me up with that goddamn knife!
I figure she can do about four at a time. Christ, if we keep her full of acid that's more like two grand a day. Maybe three.
It just occurred to me, that she has no witnesses. Anything that she says about us is completely worthless.
That's good. You can't be subtle in this town.
Some of what?
Yes!
Inspector Rock will pay you. In cash. A thousand dollars on the ninth of every month.
Yeh... This foreign made crap -- is sucking our dollar balance dry!
We had abused every rule that Vegas lived by -- burning the locals, abusing the tourists, terrifying the help. The only chance now, I felt, was the possibility that we'd gone to such excess that nobody in the position to bring the hammer down on us could possibility believe it.
Yeah... Explaining my Position. Some asshole wrote a poem about that once...
I fear nothing.
Why not? It was getting warm anyway.
I'll try. I've been wanting to go to Baker for a long time. I've heard a lot about it.
Yes! I'll help you all you need! I hate dope!
One phone call every day. Just tell us what you've seen. Don't worry if it doesn't add up, that's our problem.
Don't be stupid, drop the gun!
I got shells too, box and a half, tops.
Who the hell would you call?
C'mon guys--
Where's that?
Easy.
Follow me.
What?
Why don't you go check it out?
Who's with me?
He's dead.
My truck.
Just cover me. It was built to move.
Well...
No, no, it calms you, makes everything nice and smooth. Just takes the edge off like a beer, but in a fraction of the time.
What?
Easy. We're surrounded by something the likes none of you have ever seen before. Some kind of animals. Real fast, volatile, predators. ONE went through three of your patrons like they were Kleenex.
No one goes anywhere alone. Least of all, unarmed.
Huh?
Covered.
What!? So you can just get the hell outta here and forget about all of us!? No way! That's my god damn truck!
I don't trust you. No way! I pick who goes! And I'm holding you responsible.
Get outta here.
Whoa!
F-f-fuck you.
No bullshit.
REPEAT. WE NEED HELP. SOS. CALLING ALL CARS! WE NEED HELP AT THE UNITED NATIONS TAV--!
HELLLLLLLLP!!
Get something on that.
Am I too heavy for you?
Everyone take a role. Let's prepare the guns, ammo and whatever else we can scare up. We also need to help the hurt so we can move them on our ultimate exit outta here.  So, who's going into the basement with me?
I'm done drinking. That's it. Just Church and grocery stores. Nothin' else.
Right. Were going to need some fire power.  Do you have any sort of guns or ammunition here? Anything at all?
She's not very nice, is she?
They'll tear this place down within the hour.
That's fine.
That's one piece of four problems.
All right.
We all have to be strong, right?
Deal.
Um, my allergist told me not to engage in physically demanding activities where ragweed or spores might be present, sir.
Louella... didn't she call me a spoiled little bitch?
'Forgive'...? For What?
Really? That's a very good book. It'd make a terrific --
It's a perfectly good car. It runs.
Uh-huh. You mean what if the public finds out I perspire? And wear slacks. And drive an old jalopy? What if they find out I'm a real person. Oh no! Say it ain't so! Not a real person!
Thank you.
Oh well. I guess I better leave then.
An actress.
Right now we have to be practical.
Listen to yourself, Frances. The resistance, the anger in your voice.
...No, Ralph. I don't believe I ever was sick. But when you're treated like a patient long enough, you're apt to act like one...
No. Never.
Yeah, I suppose... Dad, who's Harry York?
He's a socialist, then?
I know.
What you have to understand, Francie, is that she... well... she wanted so much for herself too, and for me, and she never really got to... The only time I ever saw her happy was if her name was in the papers... but she could have been... if times were different she could have been a politician or... I don't know.
I pity us, Dad. I pity us both.
I can thank you for that. It was a hard-earned talent.
No, Lil. It's just you can't understand their brand of patriotism.
I wouldn't miss it.
They'll mend.
Why, you... you little bastard!
Well... you're causin' trouble, you know that?
You think I'd miss it?
I just wanted to see how you looked.
I don't know... I did... feel different... Alive.
Quietly.
What happened to him?
What?
They killed him. They threw him out that window.
Eight stories.
Hey, I'm a man, aren't I? Whattaya say we have dinner, then maybe head out to the beach, rub some of this tan off each other.  For old time's sake.
Yeah, if I don't make too big an ass of myself.
It's midnight, Harry. My glittering raiments are dissolving.
Jesus, Frances, how'd you find me?
Animal magnetism!  No ginger beer. What's this red stuff?
That sure looks like fun...  You know how long it's been since I was behind the wheel?
What?
That's right.
Whattaya think you're in now?
Frances, you're fulla drugs. You don't know what you're saying. Who do you think put you into Meadow Wood? Your mother thinks you're crazy and she'll keep on thinking it as long as it suits her.
Yeah? She's a shark, Frances. I'm not taking you there, and that's that!
Huh?
Yes you do. If you love me you can wait, right? A month, six months, whatever it takes.
Well... you're looking well.
Why do you say that?
Wherever they're going, I'm going.
No, I couldn't get my hands on one.
I never saw him. Why didn't he show up?
Why, certainly. I wanted to get a peek at his face...
That's fine with me...  Get it? Fine. A fine! Hey c'mon, c'mon, what is this, an audience or a jury?
You're Farmer? Oh... Well, look, they took your stuff out. Moved it to some hotel, I think.
...You will.
Smile, little sister, smile.
You're taking me home!
Why are these all opened?
Where are you going?
I'll be back.
I promise I'll... I promise, Mama.
I told him to come up! I told him you wanted to show them all that there's nothing wrong with you any more, that you're completely cured!
Yes, I am, and you can't stop me! You can't tell me what to do, mother. I'm a grown woman, and I can decide about my own life.
I will, I promise.
I was hoping for a kind word, little sister.
Excuse me.
Oh bullshit.
Am I supposed to say 'thank you'?
All right. Will you please sit down now?  Symington says.
Frances, you're still filled with anxiety. You feel guilty and hostile toward your family and friends. Consequently, I didn't recommend your release at the staff review.
Sedate her.
Yeah?
What is that to you? Evil as you are.
You drove him to his torment.
Better that way... for me.
People can be kinder than you think.
Kill me and have done with it.
How dare you. You're disgusting and evil.
I see it before me.
I don't know.
There is something I want.  A friend.
A brain. Extremities.
Quite right!
It's far too late for him to still be out.
He needs to vent his outrage to the skies! Make yourself heard, Willie! Learning to walk is not an easy thing! Why should it be so?
To be the best there ever was. To push our knowledge beyond our dreams... to eradicate disease and pestilence... to purge mankind of ignorance and fear...
Not as weak as I.
Now husband and wife.
I have been waiting for this ever since.
Do you foresee this happening in our lifetimes?
Very well then.
Can you think of a better reason?
You're a comfort to me, Henry.
Somebody has to!
Why Waldman? He of all people should have cheated death!
Few months perhaps. I'm gathering the raw materials even now.
Everything in moderation, Clerval.
But the possibilities. Combining ancient knowledge with new? Something like this could change our fundamental views!
I doubt that decision is still mine to make.
The strain was evident.
I'm... dying.
Are you a physician?
It will be all right. I'll take care of you.
Bill -- Bill -- Bill is out there...
I will protect you.
Maybe we should wait for Mr. Christy.
Just a feeling.  Nothing personal.
I don't know. Probably be best for everybody.
Everybody except the girl who's supposed to handle the kitchen. Annie.
Un-hunh.
You're right. It makes no sense.
I walked into it knowing I'd get hurt, but I thought I could stand anything.  I just wasn't ready for that kind of pain. We were supposed to meet in L.A. When I got back there, he sent a telegram saying he was going back to his wife.
I don't know.
Slipped in. Probably liked the scent of your perfume.
Bad bulb or no power. It's getting a little gloomy in here.
Absolutely.
I'll go take a look.
They're off now.
Marcie?
It's over twenty miles to the crossroads. Steve'll be back in an hour. Things will straighten out then. We'll take his Jeep and get help.
I meant everything.
Somebody'll see.
I need you so much, Claudette.
Here we go.
Don't get up. Take a second...
I had to.
We wouldn't want you thinking you're the only show-off in camp, would we?
Sometimes I only think about kissing women.
God, but I love that macho talk! Emergency generators! The Indian used campfires.
I thought you wanted to give him one of your motherly lectures. Ned is gonna do whatever he wants to do, you know.
Just a little. Wait a minute, woman.
You've made a science out of coincidence.
Just my son and I.
Why the fuck, outta all the god forsaken shit holes in Mexico, did you have us rendezvous at that place?
So let's do it.
The truth hurts.
Dad, I watch those reality shows. They never let anybody go. Any cop will tell you, in a situation like this, you get a chance, you go for it. This is our chance.
They're gonna kill her anyway. At least now with all these cops we've got a fighting chance.
He's my son.
My wife.
Auto wreck.
Not quite. She was trapped in the wreck for about six hours before she passed on.
Yes, they do.
Real McCoy.
Yes.
Pass.
I'm gonna just sit here and drain this bottle. And when I've drunk the last drop, if I still feel then, the way I feel now, I'm gonna take this bottle and break it over his melon head.
Nothing. I didn't make a statement. I asked a question. Would you like me to ask it again? Very well. Are you such a loser you can't tell when you've won?  The entire state of Texas, along with the FBI, is looking for you. Did they find you? No. They couldn't. They had every entrance to the border covered. There's no way you could get across. Did you? Yes, you did. You've won, Seth, enjoy it.
To yours.
I'm like you. I don't believe in vampires, but I believe in what I saw.
In the Winnebago.
It's a flop house.
So all we have to do is get by for a few more hours and then we can walk right out the front door.
No!
What's in Mexico?
Later.
-- you got your microwave --
What about the report from an eyewitness at the liquor store who said one of the brothers was shot?
Whatsamatter?
I want that son-of-a-bitch out outta here, in his car, and down the road or you can change the name of this place to "Benny's World of Blood."
I wasn't scratching!
You can't come in here.
I kinda doubt that. We're grabbin' a table, send over a waitress to take our order.
When I count three, shoot out the bottles behind him!
One... Two... Three.
How do you know?
Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong! Once you left, she became a whole different person.
As long as you don't act like a fuckin' nut, we'll be just fine.
Don't worry about it, we'll get you some glasses.
When we get to El Ray, I'll take care of it.
It's not a big deal, unless you make it a big deal. Now, I'm real happy, Richie, stop bringing me down with bullshit.
That's how you're lookin', Richie.
That's what you look like.
No, you're not. You're sippin' margaritas in El Ray. But we're not in El Ray. We're here -- getting ready to go in there. You're so pleased with yourself about getting into Mexico, you think the job's down. It ain't. Get back on the clock. That's a fuck-with-you-bar. We hang around there for a coupla hours, in all likelihood, we'll get fucked with. So get your shit together, brother.
Yeah, it's mine.
Thank you, ensign.
Who's "we"?
Or rank.  But can you do me a favor and pull a transfer order?
Standing right here in my office.
Then set out the good plates, we'll all have lunch.  My office will follow up with details.  Jumping off, now...
Thank you, sir.
I'm fine, sir.
Pardon?
I think you've resented me from the start, sir.
I don't see how, O'Neil.  Dismissed.
Sir...
Smoke her.
Only blanks.  Lemme do it.
Not that.  The White House just announced that it was sponsoring legislation that would, in one stroke, void all remaining elements of the 1948 Combat Exclusion Laws.
Well, I'm just an old dame without much time left, so you'll pardon me if I jump right in here before they discontinue my blood-type.  I am deeply concerned over the Navy's seemingly incontrovertible attitude toward women in the military.  Case in point...
Madam Senator... this is an internal document of the U.S. Navy.  I must seriously question whether --
This is just a test case, O'Neil. But if it works out -- if you work out -- it could well change the Navy's official policy on women in combat.  Or, actually, its official non-policy.  Now who's your immediate superior there?
There'll be more to follow -- but yes, dear, right now you're the pick of a very large litter.  And your success would mean a lot.  Jumping, now...
Sounds familiar.
If I have to ask again, Senator, I'll be asking in front of cameras.
Fuck.  Basher-Basher, this is Ground Crew Six requesting emergency extraction. Stand by for a PRC fix...
I can make this wall without --
Check your watch, Pyro.  Seems fast.
Gotta situation here.  Where are you?  Stuck in traffic?
Halfway 'round the world.  So that's the problem -- we can get the team in, just not out.
I take it you don't either.  Feet.
Sorry.  But after our days...  So if I try this thing... if I ship out to Coronado... what happens here?
Which is guy-speak for...
I saw an article...
Jordan.  You watch your ass.
Almost like someone put him up to it.  Okay, who?
Well, now I feel so much better.
I didn't know they let you try again.  Especially at your age.
You got anybody, Wick?
Maybe I'll just head over to McP's with the others, have a drink or four.  Don't wanna come, do you?
Sure, sure.
Mighta been civilian.
Maybe half.  Not even.
Educate her, Pyro.
McCool's that same rank.  We're both j.g.'s.
Shut up, sir.  I'm concentrating.
Listen, Sex Ape.  I'm here to stay. And if you don't want me for a roommate or classmate, you got two options -- move out or ring out. End of file.
North?
Shut your hole, Slutnik.
So am I.
The Navy?  They've made it clear they don't want to pull missiles out of subs to make room for women's heads.  What's it gonna cost to make a fleet of Trident's co-ed?
Possibly.  Just to spite DeHaven.
Hey, hey! I'm eating here!
We know, Audrey.
It's all my fault. What have I done, Animal? What have I become? Look at me. This isn't me. I don't do things like this.
Perfect! You wanted a story, well, baby, you got one.
Look, you want to make it up to your friend? Well if he's right, this is your chance.
Lucy'd kill me if she knew.
It's the maintenance entrance. Runs along the side of the tunnel. When they repaired it last year I worked on a piece about it.
You're crazy, go to the east side and take the park avenue to the JFK.
Yeah, well...
Sure. I'd like that.
I got pretty close.
I thought you said there'd only be a dozen eggs.
Somehow I never thought your life was this exciting.
Really? I'd like to find out.
Oh, just some insurance guy.
Speak of the devil.
Who is he?
That's the problem. He did.
Remember my friend we saw on t.v.?
Call me Charlie.
What?
Not anymore. Mr. Caiman, I quit.
No. Perhaps I work too much.
Me too.
I'll try.
Christ. How many tunnels lead off the island?
Fill them with cement, brick them up, put land mines in them, bombs, I don't know, just make sure that goddamned thing doesn't leave the island!
Get your people out of there or I will.
You're standing on it.
So after we kill the creature we'll begin a search for the nest.
Last time you didn't even scratch it!
Let's hope we are not the hors d'oeuvres.
You were right.
How do I do that?
I can't get through. I don't know what's wrong.
I just wanted to say, au revoir and thank you for your help, my friend.
Yes sir. Marvelous, isn't it? Completely distractionless.
... It has been my greatest honor to serve with you.  LIving by your example these years, my life has had meaning.  I have been blessed.  Sir, I... I...
I won't and nothing you say-
COME IN PROTECTOR... PROTECTOR...
DON'T BE INSANE, STOP! FULL STOP!
KILL IT? Well I'm open to ideas!...
... . Well  you have to figure out what it wants... What's its motivation?
I had the shot...
No time to worry about that, Alex. Tommy, let's get this thing slowed down... Gwen, see if you can calculate the impact point. Guy, cet down to deck C and make sure tne injured are secured. Also lets-
Oh, and did you hear he booked another fan appearance without us?
They're drifting toward me... I think they're magnetic!...
The engines are dead. We're drifting.
You think you could do better "Laredo?"
...Sleeves rolled halfway up the biceps...
You have a better plan, Alex?
The guy is terminally selfish!
Why didn't you stop at the market?
Could they be the miners?
It doesn't make sense... Surely they could have fortified the compound against those creatures...
By Grabthar's Hammer, this is true. 159	NT. LIVING ROOM - SOMEWHERE - NIGHT	159
Excuse me guys.
There IS no quantum flux and there Is no auxiliary... There's no goddamn ship  Do you get it?
Brandon, I remember you from the convention, right?... You had a lot of little technical observations about the ship, and I spoke sharply to you...
It's okay. Listen-
It's real, Brandon. All of it, It's real.
Okay, you can go on in... I'm going to get Kyle. He knows the utility tunnel system better than anybody alive.
Okay, that's where you want to be.
Yes Commander?
My cousin's boyfriend's sister went out with the screenwriter. His favorite movie is the Omegaman.  He's seen it 13 times...
GO Commander.
No, we don't have an extra Beryllium sphere.
I...Well, uh... Yes, absolutely.
Sure, Guy, If you can stand the excitement.
We're doing episode 31, Jason?
All right, let's all settle down.  If we're going to get through this we're going to have to exercise self control.
Jason, are we doing Episode 31 or not?
Are you kidding? I'm not going to tell them.
We have no right to do this. They deserve to know.
JASON...
I thought It was the "We're dead" gesture! I was agreeing! Like I know where the hold button is???
Computer, can it be repaired?
Don't be ridiculous.
Gwen...
TOMMY, 270 DEGREE TURN TO PORT!
Tomorrow morning, before the store opening.
You are so full of shit
Don't do it, Tommy. He's not worth it.
I see them!  I see them! RD STREET	PASADENA 57
Deliver the device now or I will destroy your ship.
Then tell me one thing... What does it do, the device? The Omega 13.
Our dimwitted friends don't understand the concept of acting. They have no theater, no imagination these scientists.
I'm sorry. You deserve to be shown.
You what?.. What are you talking about?
Well... Sort of...
And determination.
Why don't you just turn it on and see?
What kind of signal?
Good work, Tommy.  Let's go!
It doesn't have eyes.
It's a ROCK. It doesn't HAVE vulnerable spots!
Pedal to the metal...
Commander?... Call me Laredo?
What does she see in them?
Congress has picked up it's skirts and is racing for Baltimore. They're not waiting for spring!  Of course, they still had time to deny my promotion.  Even John Adams voted against it...
But trust you to do what?  One side in Congress wants compromise; another glorious battle; some surrender -- some, of course, just want power and money.  But if you don't mind my asking, George, what are your plans?
Don't do anything rash, please, Benedict.
Someday, George, you may need to act for the good of the people no matter what Congress thinks that is.  It may come down to us, or them someday.  You or them.  Cicero was right:  was is 'a time when the laws are silent'.
That can't be.
There, then, you can have sort of a normal life.
You are never, never to touch my guns!  Do you understand!?
Yes, William.  I am apologizing.
I ain't forgot about the freedom.
No, my lord.
Lafayette will not be happy...
The British!  These men cannot stand against them!
With pleasure... and an honor.  Did you hear about Nathan Hale?
Congress has informed the army that it is bankrupt and cannot pay the soldiers pensions.
I'm not sure.
I don't know:  delivering men and delivering men with their goodwill are two different things.  And, if he's popular with his men...
Of course the army will acquit him, that's not the point... Arnold is a man and will understand.  What I need to understand is, John, Sam... what is happening here?  Who are those people in there?  The fat ones in silk?
He's from Virginia -- there is no more classist, elitist... English place on earth than Virginia.  And, what in hell has he done for our cause?  Washington has been preaching compromise, compromise, compromise!  Hancock acts, he led the Boston Tea party!  That's why New England loves him.
You invented this, this...
He has the soul of an aristocrat who'd like nothing more than to become a king in the minds of the people!
Finally!?  It's people like these who, as soon as they get a little power, want more and more.  More ale, here!
Joseph, the British spent thousands of pounds and precious months putting together a fleet that Arnold stopped by sacrificing a heap of old barges.  In my opinion he saved my army.
Joseph, are you afraid to cross that river with me?  I accept your resignation.  With regret.  You have leave to return to Philadelphia...
I am.  Then, I understand you too serve without salary.  You know, since your charming little victories at Trenton and Princeton, the French court is softening.  I expect any time now a ship load of supplies...
When the snow melts, mon petite Marquis, I suspect the only thing blossoming will be bright red British soldiers.
And have you heard anything from our dear friend, Sally?  What with all the rumors getting back to England.  I thought she might inquire after us.  But then I believe she always looked down on us.
Virginia is outraged with your order allowing Negroes to fight in the army.  There's a deep feeling of hurt and betrayal.  They wanted you commander because they expected you would look out for our interests.
Some things must never change.
Come out and meet my soldiers. They're good people.
I want you to see our hospital.
Sir, Congress hasn't issued their pay for two months, many have not eaten properly for at least that long.  You're being a little hard on them, don't you think?
You wrong me, general; I am an officer and a horse-shoer.
You don't believe I can fight from a sense of duty and patriotism?
You know very well who it is that I love.
Really?  Which precious homily was it?
It's stupid, of course.
The place to want to be is America. Every English child dreams of it. I dreamt it.
Let's get you darker!
I'm lost in ecstasy!  And dost thou love, Thou charming maid?
Yeah, well, I'm bored, Bear. I wanna make movies.
That's your problem. You shouldn't've smoked the guy.
Farrah. Come here.
Remember Harry's story about the dry cleaner Palmer was after? Guy who stole the three hundred grand from the airline?
Hey, he should have a weapon, a knife or something.
So... how many movies you been in?
Well, I don't know. I gave the man his money, sent him on his way.
Harry, let me answer that.
You can talk to me.
I put a gun right here...  ...and I tell him, 'Sign the paper Marty or your fuckin' dead.' Like that.
Harvey Keitel. Yeah. Maybe. He was pretty good in the movie "Fingers".
There's nothin' to know. You have an idea, you write down what you wanna say. Then you get somebody to add in the commas and shit where they belong, if you aren't positive yourself. Maybe fix up the spelling where you have some tricky words... although I've seen scripts where I know words weren't spelled right and there was hardly any commas in it at all. So I don't think it's too important. Anyway, you come to the last page you write in 'Fade out' and that's the end, you're done.
Alright, Bo. You can have the money... but it's not here. I have to go get it.
What?
Yeah, I hear you bagged Martin Weir for Mr. Lovejoy.
You're gonna just give me five hundred grand?
Whenever you want it. The money's in hundred dollar bills inside one of those jock bags, you know? In a locker at the airport, waiting to be picked up.
It's not the kind of thing you do.
That's the magic number.
Depends. Who's this?
Ray. Look at me.
What've you got?
You look okay to me, Harry. Come over here and sit down. Tell me what you been up to.
Karen, it's a pleasure. How you doing?
I said I had an idea, that's all.
Wait a minute, you're not the guy, are you? The dry cleaner?
Maybe a few times I have.
She's a rock star. Every day, same time, they come down here and have breakfast. He has the egg white omelet; she has the banana pancakes. He sits facing west so he can see his billboard. She faces east so she has an excuse to wear the shades.
You're kidding, right?
Never say anything unless you have to.
I mean, at least Bo's invested in three of my movies.
Don't waste your time, Harry. The guy's not much of a movie fan. Now c'mon, gimme the key.
Twenty seven hundred.
If you'd like to tell me, yeah.
With what? Wiseguy money?
What happened? The pressure got to you?
Yeah, I like it, I'm high up, I can see everything, you know? It's the Cadillac of minivans.
Compass.
Who told you that?
You can keep what you won today. That's yours.
I'll find you, Leo...
I know who he works for. Where's your phone.
You broke in?
I know what a vig is.
How much is the wife offered?
What're you doing here?
I spent all day crawling out of a grave. The costumer kept bitching 'cause I was ripping my nylons –-
For any movie.
I don't like the title. Or the main guy's name.
Sounds fair.
The guy's setting you up. You pulled out of their Freaks deal so he's paying you back.
For starters, Marty wasn't Martin back then.
Yeah. There's a girl in it now.
Whichever. Let's talk about it tomorrow.
What happened?
Because a movie star can never order straight from the menu. They have to think of something they have to have that isn't on the menu.
Oh, shit... I'm sorry... I thought that was... I'm so sorry...
Couldn't find my toothbrush.
What's Momo gonna want with an old place, shows old movies people don't care about no more. Outside of maybe turnin' it into a porno house, I don't think he's gonna give much of a fuck. And you already got a job.
You gonna start that again? You're just like him, all you got room for in your brain is one fuckin' thing.
I'm thinking about producing.
Murray's dead.
No. But now that you mention it, I did talk to a handsome executive at Paramount the other day... who just happened to get his hands on the script.
Yeah, well I turned off the set. I used the remote control thing and laid it on the floor. You know what could've happened? The dog came in and stepped on it, turned the TV back on.
That's where you got the idea?
'We?'
Man's in town two days, thinks he's David O. fucking Selznick.
North Island, I wish to declare myself salvor-in-posession under section four two charlie of the International Maritime Convention.
A passenger liner. Over.
Affirmative, Arctic Warrior. This is United States Coast Guard North Island Station. Over and out.
They shoulda thought of that when they let her float away.
Nah. Everything was cool. It's just one of those things.
Yeah. Hell, what difference does it make if we report it now or later? We call this in now, gonna be Coastguard, FBI, who knows who, all over the place.
After fifty years there ain't nothin' left but shoe leather.
Maureen?
Roger?
Out here? What, so a seven hundred foot passenger liner drifted out of Spokane harbor and nobody managed to bump into her until now?
Supposing one of those cables breaks under tow.
Bring it on, dude.
Ever heard of insurance, big boy?
So we kill him?
Right. Wednesday.
What?
How long to fix?
I gotta pull the blades and re-seat everything in a new rotor -- .
Three, four days.
What do you want me to tell you, that we can throw this sucker back in and start pulling her like nothing happened? Can't do it, skipper.
So we get a little more for the boat. Besides, the gold'll be safer where it is.
I might be able to find something on the ship. But it's gonna take time.
What is it?
Then you're a lucky man.
Too big. More like a freighter.
Cargo like this could make a crew think twice.
Nothing. Let's get outa here.
Salvage fees on a vessel like this could come in around four million bucks. At least. Who knows, could be more. Could be a lot more.  What I'm proposing is... we split it four ways.
For now the best thing we can do is to keep quiet about this.
Of course I'm sure. I saw him.
We don't exactly have the best bargaining position.
No cowboy shit. Right.
But, who -- ?
February first.
Never mind. Before your time.  I think at least some of the crew went a little nuts. The usual stuff that happens when people stumble on a fortune. Equal parts greed and paranoia, usually resulting in homicide. What happened after that is anybody's guess. But, judging by our Greek friends down below, it doesn't look like the last time.
Showing you what?
Victims of what?
Right here.
Could be a stroke. Who knows?  The general log said the crew were fighting among themselves. "Like wild dogs."
I wish I could believe that. Either way, you know what I've done. I've got no choice.
Go.
Steer to one eight five. Let's check her out.
How's that?
Sorry.
We leave it where it is. Stick to the plan.
Dodge, you gotta get on those repairs.
Maybe.
Dodge found you out cold in one of the cabins.
We heard you scream. Any idea what you might've seen?
Shut up.
So whoever did this now has our shotgun.
You pump it out and re-seam the hull, she'll be good as new.
Who?
YES.
I made spaghetti. Do you want some?
What is it now?
I've got some important news to tell you, but it can wait till later if you're not feeling...
Yeah, I heard about that.
But I can't --
Yeah ... where is this? Bosnia?
Oh, I just love this song! Isn't it great? Doesn't it make you want to dance? C'mon!
Don't be silly, anyone can dance. Here, just follow me... watch my feet.
I uh... I feel that I need to uh -- there's something I feel I have to say... I uh, I've never said this to anyone before -- believe me, I've stayed in horrible relationships for years just so I wouldn't have to do this, but I uh...
Please tell me it isn't that teenager!
As far as I know it includes housing and meals and everything... it is really quite an offer...
So what do you think?
But... can I still get that scholarship to the Art Academy?
But I was only trying to be friendly...
Okay, okay... I won't say a word...
But I feel weird... it's so sleazy.
But this guy is like a one-of-kind, rare butterfly, and we have to follow him back to his natural habitat...
Hi.
I guess.
Why?
You've never once said anything even remotely nice to me.
Why do all guys have to play stupid guitars? It's so typical... Either they're into cars or guns or sports or guitars... it's so obvious...
What?
Why?
Look at these people behind you. I'm totally convinced they're Satanists.
We should follow them!
God, it's so totally pathetic.
Isn't it weird? It's her favorite.
Oh yeah.
I know, look at the way he drives... he's like an old man.
I can't believe it!
Ew, it's like some gross rat...
What, is she black now?
Did you have to buy new hair dye or did you still have some left over from eighth grade?
Let's go hassle Josh.
Yeah, he's beyond human stuff like that.
It'll only take a second.
Forget it. I'm sure it sucks. All these movies suck.
We have to do something fun tonight this is my last weekend of freedom before I start my stupid job.
What? Where?!
Where did you get that?
No, it doesn't. You'll see... you get totally sick of all the creeps and losers and weirdos.
Which one?
Yeah, right... Believe me, at this point I'm over the fact that every single guy likes you better than me!
That's not true, I just hate all these obnoxious, extroverted, pseudo- bohemian losers!  Sometimes I think I act so weird because I'm crazy from sexual frustration.
Yeah, maybe it'll be okay. At least I'll get to see every movie for free, I guess... I had to lie and tell them I already graduated...
I told you - my manager was a total asshole! Don't worry, I'm going to get another job... and anyway, I have some ideas for how to make money in the meantime...
I can't afford stuff like this right now.
It's a totally normal, average neighborhood!
Josh says this is a really good neighborhood...
I don't know! God, don't act so jealous I only talked to him for two minutes.
I said "great"...
Because you'll freak out and act like a total psycho about it.
I need to talk to you.
But how are you gonna pay rent and everything? You don't even have a job.
It's fine.
Make sure you're here by noon - we have tons of stuff to do... Oh yeah! I have to show you something else!
Oh, hey Enid...  So... we finally made it!
Yeah, we graduated high school -- how totally amazing.
Oh yeah, that'll definitely happen...
I'm taking a remedial high school art class for fuck-ups and retards.
That's okay...
Him. Seymour. He's the man with the records.
It's kind of falling apart.
I know it's over, asshole, I --
That's not even --
Get a job!
You're late, asshole.
The Skip James record? Yeah, that's a masterpiece. There are no other records like that! I actually have the original 78 of it in my collection. It's one of maybe five known copies.
Watch my stuff.
I... I didn't think you would have any interest in this get together... I mean if you had told me you were coming I would have warned you -- it's not like a real party or anything.
Yeah right... If I'm so cool, why haven't I had a girlfriend in four years? I can't even remember the last time a girl talked to me.
Maybe I don't want to meet someone who shares my interests.  I hate my interests! Where can I go to meet the exact opposite of myself?
Well, let's see... I guess I'd have to put Traditional Jazz, Blues, and Ragtime music at the top of the list, then probably...
Oh my god! We have to go in here!
We'll just go in for one minute -- it'll be a riot!
PLEASE? We have to!
Shh!
I'm not holding my breath in that department.
Now I remember why I haven't gone anywhere in months. I'm not even in the same universe as those creatures back there. I might as well be from another planet.
Hooray for me.
What? Why?
Are you okay?
Oh yeah?
Why?
Uh yeah. A long time ago... she called before once... it's just somebody trying to humiliate me.
Really?
I... I don't know. I don't really think I should...
I... I wish I could, Enid, but I really can't right now... I -- it's just that I --
What about this?
Dana bought it when we went antique shopping. She said it didn't go with her stuff, so she gave it to me... she thought it fit in better with my "old time thingamajigs."
That's great! "Half-empty" - that's what I like about you, Seymour, you're a natural pessimist!
I guess I probably used to when I was your age.
Right.
Yeah, well... thanks for cheering me up.
Right, exactly!
As are they all.
My wife is the game player in the family, sir.
You won't have the chance.  Any further words of encouragement?  Then I've a train to catch.
But overall, you're pleased?
Karim will have to show me where it happened. And of course, I'll need the donkey.  With any luck, I'll sort it out tonight. 
I am desperate to see Africa- but I hate the leaving.
I assure you we came close many times-
He just gave me his "monster" speech.
Does he speak English?
What?
You mean nobody died?
That's very considerate.
Nobody's seen anything like this. Lions don't have caves like this-  -they're doing it for pleasure.
You think they'll come then?  Why?
Understood- you realize now you could never have done it without me.
Clearly you don't agree about building the railroad?
Thank you, Samuel.
Underneath.  Somewhere.
It's all right, Samuel- we all get hit- 
Some Russian princes want to hunt the Himalayas. You?
Actually, I'm not eating lunch today.  I have an appointment.  In fact, I'd better go.
No harm will come to the child.  You might even say it's a privilege.  He will be the vessel for the spirit of Vigo.  And you -- well, you will be the mother of the ruler of the world.  Doesn't that sound nice?
Not in this case, my dear.  Take a look. That's not Gainsborough's Blue Boy up there. He's Vigo!
I'd rather not.
How is he these days?
I won't.
Don't worry about me.  I'm like a cat.
Thanks.
Peter, what about the bathtub?
Yes, I'm very clean.  Did they find anything at my apartment?
It's Janine Melnitz, from my staff.  She's one of my most valuable employees.
I put them in your hamper.  I thought they were dirty.
I want to stop getting involved with men who aren't good for me.
For one night in your life, do you think it's possible for us to be completely real?
Valentine's Day.  That's got to be a bummer. Where did you get that date, Elaine?
Yeah, I think the Times might be interested, don't you?  The Post might have a lot of fun with it, too.
Oh, you think so?  Well, I've got news for you.  You've got Dracula's brother-in-law in there and he's got my girlfriend and her kid.  Around about midnight tonight, when you're partying uptown, this guy's going to come to life and start doing amateur head transplants.  And that's just round one.
Okay.
Not.  Don't leave town and report any change in your address to the proper authorities. We'll be back.
Command me, lord.
Yes, the scourge --
-- the sorrow --
I await the word of Vigo.
Who are they?
You've got to stop them.  Please!
Okay, let me rephrase that question.  Didn't you once coach a basketball team for underprivileged children?
Yes.
You were the one who got me in.
Hello, Venkman.
I think they're more interested in my epididymis.
I think we should see if we can find anything abnormal on the street.
I knew that.
Roach breeding?  Sounds better and better.  Dana?  The boys are going down under the sewers tonight to look for slime.  Egon thinks there might even be some kind of big roach-breeding surge.  Should we forget about dinner and go with them instead?
They came from Ostrov in Eastern Poland.
And it's all flowing toward the museum.
Oh, just checking something for an old friend.
Who?  Just -- someone we know.
Dana!  Dana Barrett!
It's not that thing you do with your nostrils, is it?
Me?  I'm a little of everything.  Some Irish, some German, some French, Dutch -- the women in my family slept around.  And that's what made this country great.
Come on, Winston.  We can't quit now.  The holidays are coming up.  It's our best season.
No, I'm fine.  I just got light-headed for a second there.  Let's go.
No, I just thought --
I've lived in New York all my life and I never visited the Statue of Liberty.  Now I finally get here and we're taking her out for a walk.
And decent.
To the bathroom, where do you think?
Are you sick, Louis?
No thanks, Louis.  I'm really tired.  I've been rehearsing all morning.
Barrett.  Dana Barrett.
So what do you think it was?
Some people like the attention.  Some people are just crazy.
No.  If I moved out now I'd be acknowledging that what happened was real.  I'm not ready to do that.
Thanks.  What's in there?
All right.  What do you want to do?
Out!
You heard it?
I know.  You're quite a celebrity these days.  Are you here because you have info ... about my case?
Yes, but I have to tell you in private at a fine restaurant.
I'll cancel the reservation,  I found the name "Zuul" in ...  The Roylance Guide to Secret Societies and Sects.  I don't suppose you've  read it.
I'm checking on that.  I think we should meet Thursday night at nine to talk about it.
I'll pick you up at your place.  I'll bring along the Roylance Guide -- we can read after we eat.
No, we're moving you OFF CAMPUS.  The Board of Regents has decided to terminate your grant.  You are to vacate these premises immediately.
Yeah, it's some kind of mallow-type substance - that's for sure.
Yes.  I'm Dr. Venkman and this is Dr. Stantz.
One thing at a time.  We don't even know what it is yet.
Back off, man!  I'm a scientist!
I collect spores, molds and fungus.
I don't believe in luck.
Thank you.
Here are tonight's calls.
Yes, sir.  Don't worry.  We handle this kind of thing all the time.
I'm Walter Peck.  I represent the Environmental Protection Agency, Third District.
No, you may not.
Why do you want to see it?
Yes.  I don't like this.
Two wavy lines?
On Earth -- no.  But on Krypton we could slice him up like Oscar Mayer Bologna.
When you were in the bathroom, did you notice anything that was yellow and unusually smelly?
What is it?
Does she want to be?
I'll spend the night here and get back first thing in the morning.
She said he was "the Destructor."
God, it's ugly!
Neutronize.  System shut.
Peter, at 1:40 this afternoon at the main branch of the New York Public Library on Fifth Avenue, ten people witnessed a free-roaming, vaporous, full-torso apparition.  It blew books from shelves at twenty feet away.  Scared the socks off some poor librarian.
Uh-huh.  I've heard about the rockfall, Ray. I think you've been spending too much time with Spengler.
If anyone deserves it, it's Spengler and me. We're doing all the hard research and designing the equipment.
My parents left me that house, I was born there.
So far all we got is a shit smell on the twelfth floor and we almost fried a Puerto Rican bellboy.
I don't know.  I'm just guessing.
No!  Nobody ever built them like this!  The architect was either an authentic whacko or a certified genius.  The whole building is like a huge antenna for pulling in and concentrating psychokinetic energy.
Forget the trapping!  Just blast him!
Uh ... Oh these are blueprints of the structural ironwork in Dana Barrett's apartment building ... And they're most unusual.
I'm sure, I don't know.
You're coming back?
Taking my pleasure.  Do I need to clear my lovers with you?
Do you want posters, too?
Caesar?
They won't break this one.
If you set me free I will find my way back to the army, march on Rome and depose you.  Then, the army and I will restore the Republic so that animals like you will never control human destinies again.
Quintus will tell the army that you are being called to Rome to celebrate your victory.  They will hear that you are living in luxury. He will let them feel you have betrayed them for the good life. And soon the army won't even remember your name.
Ignore that?!  The sooner we leave this disgusting place the better.
Until your confirmation date.
At the opening of the month of Janus, I will ask this noble body to confirm my emperorship...
I'm serious.
He left us at dawn.
Underdog!  How can he be an underdog -- he wins all the time!  I'm the emperor why can't I kill him?  He could be poisoned, or somehow killed to look like an accident.
He must have been.  He was on the list of prisoners to be executed.
God of passages and changes?
You know, general, there is a Gate of Janus in Rome which is only closed in time of peace.  Sadly, it has remained open for three hundred years.
The trouble is defining exactly what 'right' is.
The moment you returned from the battle your options were clear.  If you are a friend to neither side, legate, you must be an enemy to both.  We needed to know what you believed.
I need to give you my word when yours is worth nothing?
Hidden.  Where my brother cannot place hands on them.  He didn't have the guts to watch them die so... I took care of it all.  The sooner he is put out of our misery, the sooner will they be safe.
The fort helps position us for a final invasion in the spring when they're most vulnerable.
Commodus is just a young man, he'll learn what you had to learn.
Let's hope he doesn't start giving orders.
Well, we can try...
My troops don't make policy.
It's my job to keep my job.  And that, by the way, is now head of Praetorian Guard.  Good ole Tribuus has been retired.
The 'people'?, listen to the people, they know what they want:  A government that gives them what they need and doesn't bother them with messy thoughts of issues.  You know, messy... thinking.  They want a dictator!  As far as the children, there is only one thing that every Roman child dreams of:  being you! A famous gladiator!
Can you stop that slaughter?!  Can you free these men?
How long do you think Commodus will let us live once he's in power?  A month?  Half a year?  Paestum will be a prison where he'll hold us until it's time...
General, all I know is you have been condemned to the Colosseum, and a trial is nowhere to be seen.
What would the poster say: "Narcissus would kill for a taste of Golden Pompeii Olive Oil?"
Don't be ridiculous.
On you!  Of course!  You are my bravest fighter -- the best fighter I have ever seen!
A great deal.  They designed and build Tiger's chariot...
Fantastic!  Wonderful!  But posters are very expensive.
I'll do it!  Sure as there's shit in the Tiber we're all going to die, but for you -- anything!
I want nothing to do with the arena.
Are you mad?  With all this unrest the Colosseum will be open day and night!  Anyway, I'm not political, I'm in the entertainment business.
Hello.
No.
No.
But could I just tell you this one thing?
This whole idea -- this date and everything. It was my parents' idea. They forced me into it.
No.
I'm trying to think of where there's a place to have a drink around here.
Nothing. I'm just wondering if they have a bar or not. I mean let's go see. Let's go see if they do or not.
Of course there is. Look -- The Veranda Room -- right there.
Yes.
Yes.
Because I wouldn't want you to do it unless you really wanted to!
Oh my God --
Because -- I am.
Elaine -- I love you.
You've got to tell me what she said.
Elaine -- that is not what happened.
Yes.
I don't see how we can.
I'll think about it.
Benjamin -- I haven't even said I'll marry you yet.
Carl who?
Carl Smith. He's a medical student. We've known him for years.
He said he thought we'd make a pretty good team.
Shhhh.
No.
Maybe we are and maybe we aren't.
Thank you.
Not exactly.
Oh -- no sir.
Look -- she's all right. She's upset and she screamed. But she's okay now.
All right, boys -- I think you can get back to your rooms. I don't think we'll have any more of this agitation. Will we, Braddock?
You heard me. Out of here.
Because I don't like you.
Get out!
I have to go now. I'm sorry.
What?
It's in the main ballroom.
Luggage? Yes. Yes. I do.
Fine, thank you. The bathroom is down at the end of the hall.
No.
That's right.
What?
But it's light in there now.
Yes.
What?
What's wrong?
We had it done last Christmas. Would you like to see it?
No, I don't. But I just feel a little funny.
Don't you think he trusts us together?
Would you like me to seduce you?
Where is it?
Jesus Christ!
Let me out!
Oh. Hello. Hello.
Very well. Thank you.
Nervous. Well, I am a bit nervous. I mean it's -- it's pretty hard to be suave when you're --
I haven't. No.
That's fine.
The room number, Benjamin. I think you ought to tell me that.
Benjamin.
What?
Mrs. Robinson -- I can't do this.
That's a laugh, Mrs. Robinson. That's really a laugh. Ha ha.
Who said it was my first time?
Wait a minute.
If you want.
How about art.
Thank you.
We don't.
About five years.
No.
I don't.
Don't tell Elaine.
Kind of.
What?
That's enough.
Well look. I have no intention of taking her out.
I was just kidding around.
Yes.
Are you?
Now don't start this.
Of course you did.
That's all right. I think I can understand why I'm disgusting to you.
May I stay then?
Then give me your word you won't.
Very good, sir.
Hello, Mrs. Robinson.
What?
No, I do. I want to tell you.
What else?
Well you don't drive around from midnight until noon the next day, Benjamin.
Because I know you don't drive around for twelve hours.
I do.
Oh, Ben -- this is so -- exciting --
What would you say to a short one? Bourbon still your drink?
No, it's not --
You don't respect me terribly much either, do you?
Well, I don't think we have a whole lot to say to each other, Ben. I do think you should know the consequences of what you've done. I do think you should know that my wife and I are getting a divorce soon.
That's quite a statement.
Could I speak to you for a second, Dad?
Twenty-one-years-old, ladies and gentlemen; four of those years spent accomplishing some rather extraordinary things at one of our nation's leading seats of learning --
I'd like to discuss this.
Dad -- can you listen --
No! No -- we're just on our way downstairs!
I told you I'll get the pearls tonight.
Why?
You're no good for this business. It's just a joke to you...
You can't.
Not with strangers.
Oh -- work!!
Money -- Ever heard of it?
Very little.
Did you ever see a stenographer with a decent frock on? -- One that she'd bought herself?
Yesterday -- yes -- that was yesterday.
I thought that, too -- but I found that it does. Come along, dance with Kringelein.
Yes --
I was so alone -- always alone -- and suddenly you were there and said that.  No. I am not afraid. It is strange.
Am I quite strange to you?
You are beautiful!
What?
When I was a little boy I was taught to ride and be a gentleman -- at school, it was a monastery, I learned to pray and lie -- and ---
Yes -- yes -- yes.
Oh -- yes but -- later.
Oh no -- that would spoil everything. I'll -- I will manage somehow -- I'll manage myself. I will go with you. When does the train leave?
Don't worry. I'll be on the train.  He leaves.
Yes -- I will be on the train.
General Director Preysing!  Baron, when I was sixteen years old, I started as an office boy in that man's factory --
No thanks -- keeping my head clear.
No, Kringelein, not tired, -- just --  Well -- well --
I would be awfully glad to oblige, you've been so decent to me. Three hundred?
No -- not at all.
Oh, no, stay here, Baron -- stay.
No doubt you would, Baron. But do you know, I'm quite indispensable to her. I'm her ballet master and her nurse. I hardly belong to myself anymore. But, there you are, it's Grusinskaya -- you can't help adoring her.
Insolent -- Berlin manners.
Be quiet.
No -- no -- not yet. Well, I mustn't let it interfere with my duty. Any news here?
Man -- that's terrible. He was a nice fellow -- I am sorry about him.
No, Doctor.
Yes -- Oh -- oh -- yes, -- 
Haven't you anyone -- Haven't you anybody -- you -- I mean -- Are you all alone in the world.
Everything?
You are funny. You speak of life as if it were a train you wanted to catch.
Oh, don't go.
I'm waiting for him here. The Baron and I have been together all day. A hundred miles an hour -- in a motor car -- and in an aeroplane -- It was marvelous --
Yes --
What?
You're a good man, Mr. Kringelein -- a very good man.
Moreover...
Me.
Only in mutual advantages -- moreover.
What?
Should throw a great weight into the balance...
My daughters -- yes, my daughters. 
Hello!
Well -- you want me?
Well?
Oh, yes.
You think so?
Here, hold up!
Why not?
Very simple -- I've always liked the way you dressed, Preysing -- English, isn't it?
We have a good many connections in England, naturally.
And I said we didn't.
In that case give us the articles. We'll sign at once. We know all the details...
It will pass -- it will pass -- come.
Oh, yes, Suzette.
I've done my hair differently -- do you like that?
Why not?
I wish to be alone.
Every seat for the opening has been sold at Vienna. Sold out for three days.
What -- what is it? Last night...
There was -- there was.
But when did he go? How do you know?
Some champagne, Miss Flaemm?
Does the world belong to you, Mr. Preysing?
An embezzler -- you're going to take that back, right here in the presence of this young lady -- who do you think you're talking to? You think I'm dirt, if I'm dirt, you're a lot dirtier, Mr. Industrial Magnate Preysing.
-- We must do something...
Where is that girl -- she was working with him -- she enticed me into her room.
Did I say I wanted a cheap room to live in -- when I came here did I ask for a cheap room? Did I?
Terrible. After this, no more ballets for me. Jazz --  Just jazz.
The troupe, the scenery, everything -- all on board, waiting. You have a rehearsal in Vienna tomorrow morning. Come, Madam, are you mad?
Have I kept you waiting?
Everything depends on the Manchester merger.
Well -- gentlemen.
You let me talk till I'm hoarse and you had Manchester sewed-up all the time. Why?
Yes -- that's what I want -- I'd like to tear loose -- I'd like a drink. I'd like to go down to that dancing place. I'd like to start something.
I want to see her, I want to do some dictating -- report of the conference for my father-in-law.
Let's go down and find her -- I need a drink -- Come along Zinnowitz.  I don't know anything about women -- been married for twenty-six years.
I never fucked up before, Bobo.
It'll never happen again. I swear.
You'll never shit right again.
Gee, I better not, if it's okay. I still gotta drive back up to Los Ang-gleez.
Hah.
Fine.
Goody!
Oh, Cole, please. Please come out of it. What would I do without you?
And I don't just mean the SEC. We could have the FBI breathing down our necks.
Every once in a while, a major change comes through. We have seven seconds to take advantage, put our buy order, our sell order, into the computer in New York before the Tokyo data comes in.
These machines -- They're in here.
I must admit, Mister Fellowes, I had moments I was worried.
Delmar? I never go out to California. That's a thousand miles from here.
What is?
But they must be! They cut glass!
Why, of course it is. I can offer you -- well, five hundred dollars.
I have only one thing now. Are you interested?
Just myself.
Mr. Kaggs, I'm sorry.
Fair enough.
I guess I owe you my life.
Just a little accident. I went by your place, picked up your mall. Just bills, I'll take care of them.
No. And you have to be.
Get off the grift, Roy.
I pay my debts.
Bobo won't be. He'll spend the money to make sure.
This way's perfect.
And Myra's stuff?
Well, you're gonna start, if you hope to live through this. A square job and a quiet life. You start showing up at the track or the hot spots and Bobo's boys will be all over you.
I thought it over, and you were right. You wanted me out of the rackets, and now --
I know you do, so that's why --
No.
I don't think so. You probably shouldn't either.
Not very good!
Uh-huh.
) That's what it is, isn't it? Keep me down. Your turn to be in charge, have the power.
What?
You're too young. You should be in school.
Taking you for granite?
No, baby. Come to Mama.
Oh, don't be stupid.
Every day in every way.
See you soon.
Myra, I'm not following this.
Yeah? How?
That's where they keep the criminally insane, isn't it?
Join up with you! I watched you, Roy, I've been watching you, wondering if I should talk about this at all, or maybe just... 
Open your door.
I'm well connected, Roy, Cole introduced me to a lot of people. Very valuable. Valuable for us.
I called a fellow I know in Tulsa, the one who plays my chauffeur. There's a sucker there he says is made for us. And a boroker that just shut down, we can use their office, not change a thing! Now, I can scrape up ten grand without much trouble. That leaves fifteen or twenty for your end. We could start this weekend, get the sucker into position --
Bullshit!
) What?
Thank you.
No. I mean, I don't believe it. Lilly is not a suicide. I know my mother, nothing would make her check out.
It may be Lilly, but it isn't suicide.
My mother... Well, I guess it doesn't matter now. She worked for gamblers. She always knew they might turn on her some day.
Sickness comes to us all, Mister Dillon.
Pamela Whittington was a long time associate of Dr. Loomis.  Her home office was ransacked.  It was chock full of Loomis' files on Meyers.  It'd say that makes Meyers a suspect, wouldn't you?
It's Blake.  How do you feel about Wisconsin?
... I think it would be best if you both left.
I never stop thinking about it, Detective.  The only way in or out of this school is through that gate, and it is secured at all times.
Well, I can assure you, it won't happen again.  Thanks for your concern.  Goodbye.
Doesn't look good.
Would somebody shut this guy up?
Checking out your place.
And miss the big game?  No way.
Forget it.
I know.
No.
Can I come in?
Nothing a good stiff drink can't fix.
He's been living out of moving boxes for three months.
What?
I'm fine.  I just need to lie down...
Michael Meyers.
Oh, right.  Sorry.
What is it?
You think they'll let him in dressed like that?
Linda, you are without a doubt the scariest person on campus.
You mean Tommy.  Yeah, on the weirdness scale he's about an eleven.  Supposedly some scary shit happened to him when he was a kid.  Messed up his head.  He's harmless, though.  Probably just lonely.
Relax.  Everything's cool.  Didn't I tell you Harry would be here?
Answer what?
But I've seen him!
A man came by the house.  A psychiatrist by the name of Loomis.
Who are you?
It's ... Michael ... Michael Myers!
Why would anyone want to kill an innocent baby?
It's a rune ... Thorn.
'When applied directly to another person, Thorn could be used to call upon them confusion and destruction -- to literally visit them with the Devil.'
He's gone.
You don't know that for sure.  It could have been anyone.  A practical joke. Kids.
Or what's left of him.
I'm here now, Jamie.  You're going to live. You have to.
Dr. Loomis, thank God you're here.  You heard her, didn't you?  It was Jamie.
Please -- just tell me the truth.  Has Michael Myers come home?
I dunno, boy.
Used to be against the law, didn't it?
Must have changed that law.
It's enough that you've brought yourself home!
Go home!
Let's talk about it some other time.
Leave me alone!  After eight years of horrendously close association, the time has come to part!  I crave solitude and time for reflection-- and then a reunion in privacy with my own flesh and blood.  You and I may not meet again for months!
Let's talk about something else.
You know me, boy.
Sorry.  At least you've got a place to come back to.  I don't have a place to come back to anymore.
I dunno. You know.  I used to really love that Alice. Do you know that?
You.
The one direct, decisive, intelligent act of your life!
If what?
They were enemies.  We were at war.
Goodbye, Looseleaf.
How are you, honeybunch?
The posies are for her?
What you say is, "Pass the fucking catsup."
You're making a joke.
For what?
You're hollow, like a woman.
Are you--do you--
He worships Father.
"Harold, the Patron Saint of Taxidermy."
He was a stretcher-bearer in the Korean War.  Were you in a war with Father?
England?
"The sting."
Tell me that!  Tell me that!
Wow.
Uck.
I don't know.
When I grow up, I'm going to go to Mhravitch.
Sir?
Dr. Woodly says he's seen hundreds of children permanently injured by football.  He says that when there's a war, everybody goes but football players.
Scat!
Daughter--I love you very much.
He's a very decent man, Harold.
He thought he could take my place. It is now my privilege to give an unambiguous account of why I don't think he's man enough to do that.
Ghastly, cruel, unnecessary.
Mrs. Wheeler is dead.
That is the most heartless statement I ever heard pass between human lips.
"Bring me a side order of Mrs. Wheeler."
And they have very mixed feelings about women.  They hate them in a way.  One reason they like war so much is that they can capture enemy women and not have to make love to them slowly and gently.  They can scrog them, as you say--  for revenge.
Yes.
I don't think so.
Sneaking in the back door.
More nerve than the doctor, I must admit.  He hasn't been home for two days.  Has he suddenly lost interest in sleep and color television--and the violin?
About a broomstick and a cigar box--and the attenuated intestines of an alley cat.
Hope.
You feel I've done a dreadful thing--leaving him?
Almost a Christmas scene.
Just one favor.
I see.
Rifle?
He's in East St. Louis with his mother--visiting an aunt.
He's afraid of you, Harold.  He knew you'd want to fight him.  He doesn't know anything about fighting.  He hates pain.
Sounds quite beautiful.
Like what?
If he thinks he's man enough.
If you've lived a good life, fought well--
Of course he can go--if he'll just go down on his hands and knees for a moment--and promise me that he does not find me comical in the least degree.
Ooops.
And what, exactly, is your relationship to Mrs. Ryan?
I've never heard of it.
I can just hear the editorial wee- wee-weeing when Looseleaf and I start flying in pacqualinincheewa root.  I can hear the Alice-sit-by- the-fires now: "We discovered it in the Amazon Rain Forest.  Now we cure you with it.  Now we lower our eyes with becoming modesty as we receive heartfelt thanks."
What for?
Yes.
You haven't heard me yet.
We do survive, don't we?  You're going to have to apologize, of course, for calling me a bastard. That's a matter of form--not allowing you or anybody to call me a bastard.  No rush about that. Just remember to apologize sometime soon.
In any event, I will not beg for mercy.
My violin is avenged!
You'd be killing a friend.  Don't you know how much I like you?
If you want to be found that way.
I'll put it in Paul's room, where it belongs.
You don't know?
So that's it! "Kestenbaum, Kestenbaum." Everybody was yelling "Kestenbaum, Kestenbaum." I thought it was some foreign language.
For saying "shit." Or is that okay now?
Well--I walked up to the front door. I was still alive.  Big surprise. I rang the doorbell, and old Mrs. Wheeler answered.  She had her Goddamn knitting.  I said, "Guess who?" She conked right out.
Do I have to?  Who's the little girl?
Men can touch other men, and it doesn't mean a thing.  Haven't you ever seen football players after they've won the Superbowl?
What a relief!
He's alive!
If you have to go out with some guy--can't he be more like Dad?  Herb Shuttle and Norbert Woodly-- can't you do better than those two freaks?
A vacuum cleaner salesman and a fairy doctor.
Still lives with his mother.
To only exercise Dr. Woodly ever gets is playing the violin and making that stupid peace sign.  Peace.  Peace.  Peace, everybody.
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Dr. Woodly?  You know who this is?
He isn't any friend of Father.
Doing what?
Or was.  We haven't done anything wrong, you know.
That's something I suppose.
I'm glad.
If you'll pardon the expression, that's when you'll see the fur and feathers fly.  Good night.
Far as I know.
I feel as though I had been made a perfect chump of.
He's the most wonderful guy I ever met, Penelope.  He's the most complicated guy I ever met.  I can't believe it, but he's going to take me to Africa with him.
No doubt Paul thinks it stinks.
Tonight's the night.
It is?
That's the XKE.
It's an experimental model.  He doesn't dare leave it in his car, for fear it will fall into the hands of competition.
He told me one time what the proudest moment of his life was. He made Eagle Scout when he was twenty-nine years old.  Oh, Norbert--promise me that Paul has not gone into the park!
And maybe Paul.  What about the murderers?  They're in there!
We met here earlier this evening.
Tell her to have a nice trip.
Not true.
You can believe that if you want. I talk to guys like you, and I want to commit suicide.  You get that weight-lifting set I sent you?
We can take off the "Wanda June" with a butter knife.
Yes, we do.
No.
You mean I'm black?
We offer Female Wrestling, that is, nude body to body contact, with a girl of your choice in a private room. Twenty dollars a half hour, thirty dollars hour. Any other arrangements may be discussed in the privacy of your room. Tipping is permitted. We accept Bank Americard, Master Charge and American Express.
Pull out your cock.
Are you going to stiff me?
Look, that twenty dollars you just paid, I don't get any of that. That goes to the guys that own this place. I get two bucks an hour, minus ten percent for a bail fund. I make all my money on tips.
Sure. What do you want? Tips can be anywhere from thirty dollars to seventy dollars.
I said I just wanted to talk to you...
Okay.
I'm looking for Tod. Is he in?
What girls you got here?
I like it, Mr. Van Dorn.
What's that shade of blue called?
Overpowering?
Too bad. I wasn't in it.
You know her?
Tod might know.
You're not a film producer, are you?
Okay. My client pays for it anyway.
Tonight. When you get out, we'll go.  Why didn't you tell the other detective?
No.
What rate?
You never met a working girl before, have you? You think I like sucking off guys all night? Maybe I do. So what?  You can't even say it, can you?
You don't understand shit.
Did you ever live in a room with six people and you didn't have any money, any food, any furniture? Have your brother come out, his car break down, he can't get a job? Your friends stealing food, going through trash behind a supermarket?
You and I, Niki, have very different ideas about sex.
Not very.
Tod was.  He was with Ratan.
They believe in the 'TULIP.'
Wait, wait. I'm trying to figure this out. This is like Rona Barrett. Before you become saved, God already knows who you are?
Wow. Then why be good? Either you're saved or you ain't.
Why can't I meet him now?
Where does he live.
Just a guess. She ain't dead though is she?
Tod gave me the slip. I have to find him again. Where does he live?
What are you paying me for?
What have you found out?
I don't know.
What's it called?
I felt like such a shit, pilgrim, after what I did to you -- not that I did anything wrong -- that I kept investigating, poking around. There's some poor s.o.b. in L.A. with his face all bent out of shape who you've damaged his movie career. Lucky for him, people don't look at his face.
Like what?
I just heard. Who is he?
It's just a name.
Go home, pilgrim. There's nothing you can do. Forget this place. Start over.
They don't know. They were having some recreation deal out at Knott's Berry Farm and Kristen wasn't there when they got back to the bus and they couldn't find her.
Yeah. She's quite upset. I'm going to fly out today. They want me to bring some pictures.
That's not true, Mr...?
That's not true, Jim. In fact, I think you're very close to the type we're looking for.
I thought you were quite good in it. I also like the girl in it. Really thought she was good.  I wondered if she was still around. If she was still working.
Rucker.
Who?
I don't know what you're talking about.
That's all right.
It's cool. Why do you think I got in the movies? How much poon do you think you get in the car wash business?  Look, fifty thousand dollars buys a lot of pussy. You can get your joint pulled by beautiful girls every night for the rest of your life for fifty thousand dollars. So why fuck with the movie business?
...I'd just start my own business. That's what I did. Get into kid porn. That's big now. Why don't you come around the set? Meet some people. If you still want to invest, I'll ask around.
Calm down, mister. You don't want to get the cops in here do you? You got a family?
Why don't you just go outdoors, mister? Cool off.
You ever play Chicken?
He didn't look good at all. Something strange is going on. He's got himself into some trouble. He wouldn't say what.
To anybody.
My name ain't Niki. It's Pattica, like in Attica.
No, Andy. Don't know the kid.
Nope never saw her before.  Kurt, come over here. Don't use underage kids. Wouldn't touch 'em for all the cow shit in Mexico.  You recognize this piece of wool, Kurt?
You working in San Diego now?
Oh, <u>yes</u>? Well, that's all right. I've got a brother who's a real cut-up, too. I'll never forget the time we had this old TV set with no parts in it. Well, Tommy stuck his head behind it and started giving a newscast before the whole family. We were all hysterical. And here's little Tommy pretending to be Walter Cronkite.
Out!
You too, Buster. Stand over here. Lady, you're in a heap of trouble. I have you down here for several violations; speeding, resisting arrest, driving without a license, driving a stolen vehicle, possession of a stolen tree... Where's the tree?
Possession of a stolen shovel.
Lady, is it true you're driving without a license?
I'm a file clerk - Harrison Feed and Grain.
I see the eternal goddess of beauty and love. I see Aphrodite. The consummate woman.
You're welcome.  Did you know him?
Me neither. I heard he was eighty years old. I'll be eighty next week. A good time to move on, don't you think?
Oh, at the dentist's?
Oh, it's fine. Fine.
Heavens no! I don't have the time. But I like to keep in practice and poor Glaucus occasionally needs his memory refreshed as to the contours of the female form.  Do you disapprove?
Yes. Very much.
Over there by the courthouse.
That little tree. It's in trouble. Come on.
It is kind of rough.
Look, the ice is melting.
Well, I really don't drink...
My umbrella?  Oh, that's just a relic. I found it when I was packing to come to America. It used to be my defense on picket lines and rallies and political meetings - being dragged off by police or attacked by thugs of the opposition.  A long time ago.
Oh, Big Issues. Liberty. Rights. Justice. Kings died and kingdoms fell. I don't regret the kingdoms - what sense in borders and nations and patriotism - but I do miss the kings. When I was a little girl I was taken to the palace in Vienna, to a garden party. I can still see the sunshine, the parasols, and the flashing uniforms of the young officers. I thought then I would marry a soldier.  Later, Frederick would chide me about it.  He was so serious. A doctor at the University. And in the government.
But I don't play anything.
Is he? Ah, the police. Always wanting to play games. Well, here goes.
Vice? Virtue? It's best not to be too moral. You cheat yourself out of too much life. Aim above morality. As Confucius says, "Don't simply be good. Make good things happen."
Well --  - they say he was very wise, so I'm sure he must have.
I like you, Maude.
Pray? No.  I communicate. 
Where's that?
Boy! It sure has been a wonderful day. And you - you are beautiful.
What is it, Harold?
... of you. You'll all end up like this.
We <u>are</u> alone - you and me and everybody. But we can look at those stars and maybe someone down the beach or across the sea in China is looking at them, too. Someone we don't know and most likely will never see - that someone is breathing along with us. And the star- gazers of the past - from peasant to princes - and the star-gazers of the future - all of us breathing and looking up there. We are alone - but look at the stars and never feel lonely.
Here.
I have a sore throat.
Fay, I'll call you back.  What did you say?
To whom?
At a funeral.
I'm sure. But what else do you do with your time? Do you go to school?
Oh. Well, how do you spend your day?
Yes. What kind of things do you do?
Yes.
Yes.
I'd have liked to talk to him.
Yes, ma'am. Somebody had some trouble parking.
No more delays, Kirsty. No more teasing. Time to play.
Julia.
Yes. You're a girl who remembers her promises.
No! He SHOULDN'T be here! It SHOULD'VE been a trick!
I know.
What?
Are you crazy?
It's you! You HAVEN'T always been as you are. You were HUMAN. Remember. Remember all your confusions. Think!
What are you talking about? Who are you?
Yeah.
I saw it... him. But I got away. And I took the box. And I solved it. And they came.
Oooh!! Who was here? Nixon? Houdini? You mind sharing your mystic insights?
No, listen this: Sammael, the desolate one, lord of the shadows, son of Nergal --
Rotten eggs and the safety of mankind.
See? I don't like that --
"Paranormal"  But -- you read the transmission.
No. It was red. Bright red.
"In the absence of light, darkness prevails." For there are things that go bump in the night, Agent Myers.  We are the ones who bump back.
1945, you mean. Hitler died in '45.
Oh, please. I'm not "pure of heart."
Nah. I'll be around, Red, just back in the field.
"Myers", huh? You have a first name??
Grounded? Who's grounded?
In the end, after you've killed and captured every freak out there -- there's still one left: you.
Don't move. We --
No. Don't --
My job.
Father's back?  Still angry?
Oh-n-no -- I --
No one ever helps me. It's my job.
No. I never was.
Professor, that girl you were talking about --
I think I can help -- Talk to her -- I can bring her back.
No. Not this time, H.B. It's been months since I've had an episode. And you know what? I'm learning to control it.
What -- ?
You want to know -- Now -- ? Here? Red, white, whatever -- Guys are all the same.
Two steps back, please.
Look, do you want the bed in or not?
Oh, sod you.
It's just a puzzle box.
You solved the box. We came. Now you must come with us. Taste our pleasures.
It's important.
I don't remember.
Oh Christ.
I don't want to see the dress.
Forget him.
I'm very happy.
Just help, will you? Please God, help me --
There's very little I can do about it.
Like this? Look at me! LIKE THIS?
I saw everything.
Oh my God.
Like who?
I don't know. Probably wanted a hideaway.
So what's the argument?
Oh Christ. Julia...
I don't know, I haven't looked. You know me and blood.
I'll be scarred for life.
Are you O.K.?
O.K.
O.K.
Kirsty.
What's wrong with you?
I don't know where to begin...
What?
Just soda.
Do you care ?
Yeah, why don't I?
Am I?
O.K.
Call me tomorrow.
I love you, honey.
Of course.
Gone?
That's right. Cointreau.
Please. I want to see you home. All right?
Oh, I don't know. Up-tight. Frigid.
As long as you don't mind the smell of fur --
Will you GO, damn you?
'Bye.
I don't know.
IT WON'T GO ANY LOUDER.
I don't want old sad bastard music either.  I just want something I can ignore.
I wanna live with a musician.  She'd write songs at home, ask me what she thought of them, maybe even include one of our private jokes in the liner notes.
Oh no, Rob, that's not obvious enough. Not at all.  Dick, did you hear that?
But in your opinion, would I definitely go?
Because it's a brilliant film.  It's funny, violent, and the soundtrack kicks fucking ass.
How do you know about that?
What the fuck is that?
You are not in a band, Barry.  You are not a musician.  And no posters.
That was one of the reasons they asked me to join originally, yes. But --
How many tickets can I put you down for?
So?  You even said they're good.
They always seemed...
Do not get ahead of yourself.
Why?
Nobody.
I'm Caroline Fortis from The Reader. I want to do a story on you.
So.  Is now a good time?
Pardon me?
That's five.  So.  Why did you decide to deejay again?
Nice friend.
What's his name?
Oh, you know... a lot of people aren't too old for clubs but they're too old for acid jazz and garage and ambient and all that.  They want to hear old funk and Stax and New Wave and Old School Hip Hop and some new stuff all together and there's nowhere for them.
Yeah.  A billion.  Right... How are you?
Uh...yes, at the moment.
There's been a rash of them, recently. I find it a little unnerving.  In fact Marco called a few months back, and he wanted to see me, and rehash the past as they say, and I wasn't really up for it.  Do all men go through this?
Do it.  Do it.
I am fine...  I gotta go.  Goodbye.
You look upset.
Hello, Rob.  Remember me?  I'm Ray. Ian.
Good.  So shall we leave it at that then?
-- and who says I like Marvin Gaye, anyway?
Is that right?  I'd like a word with him.
Don't you think there are more important things to talk about than my record collection?
I don't know.  It's one of the things I thought of.
I don't know.
Well, if you don't know, there's a chance, right?  It's like, if someone was in the hospital and he was seriously ill and the doctor said, I don't know if he's got a chance of survival or not, then that doesn't mean the patient's definitely going to die, now does it?  It means he might live.  Even if it's only a remote possibility.
Okay, okay, we have a nine percent chance of getting back together. Does that clarify the situation?
Nevermind.
Is what better?  Better than what?
Jesus Christ, Rob.  Is that really what's bothering you?
No.  I was living with you, remember? We've slept together but we haven't made love.  Not yet.  But I'll tell you one thing.  The sleeping together is better.
Will you please just go?
Hi.  I've been looking for an envelope of my receipts from last month and I'm thinking I didn't take them with me.  Have you seen them around?
I'm sorry to call, but I need that stuff...
We'll talk some other time.
I guess.
I want you to say that you haven't, and I want it to be the truth.
Those look heavy.  Where's Ian?
That bad, eh?
I'm sorry to go on about it.  But, I don't know, there's a lesson here somewhere, and I want to make sure you get it.
I don't want to go back.
I want to feel something else than this.  It's either that or I go home and put my hand in the fire.  Unless you want to stub cigarettes out on my arm.
Ray's a disaster.  I don't know what that was all about, except that sometimes you need someone to lob into the middle of a bad relationship like a hand grenade, I guess, and blow it all apart.
Okay.
Look, we're okay now.  We just had a nice time.  Let's leave it at that.
Well I was gonna lie and now I can't, because you'd know I was lying.
To make you feel better.
Okay.
Hey, great idea.  What I'll do is, tomorrow I'll get a hold of a box full of mint Elvis Presley 78s on the Sub label, and I'll pay for it that way.
And hairstyles and clothes and attitude and friends and...
I tricked you into meeting some people you'd think were great.  I thought it would be fun to introduce you to someone with a Tina Turner album and then see whether you still felt the same way.
Barry?  Barry knows about this?
I'm going to talk to you.
I'm going to talk to you about whether you want to get married or not.  To me.
I mean it.
Right.  Okay, then.  Shall we go?
Are you persuadable?
Fair enough.
I'm just sick of thinking about it all the time.
Hey.  It's Liz.
You called this morning?
It's true!
If by "we" you are referring to men, then I have to say that just the once would do.
Yup.
No way!  I'd cramp his style.  And I wouldn't want to listen to all that stuff happening on the other side of the bedroom wall.  I'm way to unattached for that.
Oh, right.  Alright.
I use it but I don't understand it when other people use it.
Everything all right?
What do you mean?  Where did she go?
Meet a nice girl and have children. I promise the next time we talk I'll have it all sorted out.
He's in Jamaica with a twenty-three- year-old.  A friend of my daughter's. He had the fucking nerve to call me and ask me to borrow some money and I told him to fuck off, so he asked me to sell his singles collection and send him a check for whatever I go, minus a ten percent commission. Which reminds me.  Can you make sure you give me a five?  I want to frame it and put it on the wall.
Sure.  Ten cents.
Naw.  Those are for us.
No thank you, I'm fine.
I don't follow you.
Carl Smith.
Basil the II.
Good day, Miss Cartwright.
He's dead.  Whatever I may or may not feel means exceedingly little to him now.
The less exposure I recieve around government buildings the better.  You, as Mrs. Taupin, will attract considerably less attention than I.
Yes.
That would be difficult to explain.
He knows about you.
That's insane.
You kill with your left hand?
Is that a threat?
Empty.  And fear.  Fear of those that would kill you and fear of those that would love you.  It can never last, and in the end you always end up destroying both.
All of it finished.
I'm the last.  Oh Christ, I'm the _last one_!
Now there's a new topic.
What's all of this got to do with me?
All I need is for you to check the name.
It's that important?
It's bullshit.  Everything. My job, the people I get involved with, I'm up to here with it.
What are you doing man?
First food, no?  A good meal makes conversation so much easier.
You know me home.  Me name.
You are still so very young.
What?
No!
This can't be.
You recall how I spoke of the push you feel and how I make it less?
There is an imperfection.  For all your healing, if your head ever leaves your neck, you are dead. You can survive anything but steel against your threat.  Then it is over.  The end.
Go to hell.
I'll not take that kind of talk from you.  From those others below, maybe.  But not from you.
Do what you must.
Tradition.
They're nothing but boys.  It will be a slaughter tomorrow.
Not likely.
If you wish to play games, Major.
Stay out of it.
Who do you think I am?  One of your freckle faced children waiting to die tomorrow?  "Threaten you"?  You and I just living will always be a threat.  Forever.  Look at your life, Major.  Look at mine.  Nothing there but threat.  Threats and nothingness. It's what we live for.
Thanks.
Where did you learn that?
We ran down that Church Hill info. She's right.  There is no Richard Taupin.
Think we should call the local P.D. out there first?
Head still secure to the neck.
What are you doing here?
-Since you last saw me.
How do you do it, Kahn?  How do you live so full of life for so long?
I've had a few more concerns.
MACLEOD!
This isn't done.  Get up.
It's all we have.
American.
A mystery.
We were very close.
Just your pappy scared some.
The Sheriff has just received four more letters threatening his life, but he says nothing can interfere with his duty.
What's the idea of locking this?
I was having a little chat about you just this afternoon -- with our Mister Duffy.
Heartbreaking! How would you like to work for me?
Seventy-five.
My job, Bruce. I started it -- and I'll finish it.
I'll come a-running, pardner.
He comes by it naturally. His grandfather was a snake.
He certainly -- hic -- does!
And what's the matter with a thousand dollars?
On second thought, would you let me have it? I'll get the tickets.
Believe me, Bruce, I know what I'm doing. He'd get you in a crap game --
Certified and everything. Got it right here in my wallet... What? No, he's not here -- I'm in a phone booth.
Fine. And here's a kiss for you.
I'm sure you haven't any.
But, gee, Hildy -- he gave us that insurance business -- and you promised --
Hello, Bruce...
Yes!
Oh.
Well, Albany's a mighty good insurance town. Most people there take it out pretty early in life.
And remember this, Bruce! I love her, too.
So long.
And now I don't know where my mother is. She may be lost.
Gee! Take a look, will you?
I'll give you three minutes to tell me where he is.
Your luck's not with you now!
The power of the press, huh!
Hello, Walter.  Hi, Louie -- how's the slotmachine king?
Oh, yes I would. I'd know you any time --
Divorced me. It sort of makes a fellow lose faith in himself. It almost gives him a feeling he wasn't wanted.
Now, that's a nice thing to say.
All I know is that instead of two weeks in Atlantic City with my bridegroom, I spent two weeks in a coal mine with John Kruptzky -- age sixty-three -- getting food and air out of a tube! You don't deny that. Do you?
I know, Walter, but I --
I wasn't satisfied! I suppose I proposed to you!
Get away, Svengali.
Look at this! 
I know you, Hildy, and I know what it would mean. It would kill you.
Where'd you meet this man?
He does, does he? How did I treat you -- like a water buffalo?
You're not afraid, are you?
I might have, Walter, but you were never there.
So -- Sweeney gets twins -- and Earl Williams gets hanged tomorrow.
We're not interested.
Never mind it? That's not my money! That's Bruce's money!
Well, this expert Dr. Egelhoffer, from New York, decides to make Williams re-enact the crime --
I know. Where is he, I said.
Wait a minute -- wasn't it Stanley who discovered Livingstone?
I get it!
That one -- how you gonna take him? They'll see him.
Where's Butch?
Where's Bruce?
Hildy, you think I could? After this story?  Here! You're just nervous.
Was she? Did you notice?
Louie, where'd it happen? I'm going out!
What is it? Here!
Who did you talk to?
Uh-uh. As long as we were in there together pitching -- they couldn't lick us. Well, it's been a lot of fun.
I mean -- working together. Just like the old days. The things we've been through, Hildy.
Remember the time we broke into the D.A.'s office, and copied Fifi Randell's diary?
Yeah - but that time we stole Old Lady Haggerty's stomach off the Coroner's physician. We proved she was poisoned though, didn't we?
In the Shoreland Hotel. And our only chaperon was the poor old lady's stomach.
Well, if it's my last story, I'd like it to be a good one. But -- I guess I can't, Walter.
I don't know what to do, Walter.
It's awfully clear now. Bruce needs a wife who can give him a home -- and affection -- and peace. I couldn't do that for him, Walter. I'm what you made me -- a cheap reporter who'd give up her soul for a story!... Is that job still open?
Walter!
What would you do if it was a daughter?
Sure, Heaven! You've probably thought up another coal mine to send me down in -- to get a new story for your paper!
I was in here -- and they had some kind of murderer in with them. They were hiding him!
What do you mean, I handed her? The patrol wagon was on the wrong side of the street.
I don't think she's talking much... You know what I mean?
Western an' Thirty-fourth.
You got plenty of money?
Yeah! Well, I do the firing, too. Remember that, Duffy, and Keep a civil tongue in your head.
I think it is.
Hildy -- I can't. I'm busy -- I -- Let me up, Hildy. Earl Williams has escaped --
It doesn't matter. The publicity's the main thing.
Come, come, Sheriff, lightning doesn't strike in the same place twice. Nothing's going to happen.
Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot you were here. No, Mr. Williams, we still have some questions for you. Sheriff, will you kindly extinguish the lights?
Three bullets! Any good?
Give me a hand with her, will you?
This Egelhoffer's pretty good.
Don't you remember? He's the guy went to Washington to interview the Brain Trust, and gave out a statement that they were all sane. It created a sensation!
Who's this guy she's gonna marry?
The Crime Commission has offered a reward of ten thousand dollars for Williams' capture.
I'll have it in a minute.
No luck on Williams, yet -- call you back.
You ought to stay over. You always wrote a good hanging story, Hildy.
Hold her, boys!
What do I know about Williams?
The names are Merwyn D. Mayor, who is the Mayor's brother-in-law --
No, I couldn't do that.
I ain't got time, Fred, honest. I'll see you after.
We're up against a lot more than that with that nutty slogan you invented: 'Reform the Reds With a Rope'.
And you fell for it, Pete. It frightens me what I'd like to do to you.  Who else knows about this?
We got to think fast before those lying reporters get hold of this. What'll we tell 'em?
Sssh. Wait, Fred.  What?... Where?... Where? Holy Moses!
How would you like to have a job for three hundred and fifty dollars a month. That's almost a hundred dollars a week!
If we didn't have election Tuesday I'd have this on my conscience.
Aiding an escaped criminal! And a little charge of kidnapping I'm looking into.  But that's the jail! There must be somebody there!
It's a frame-up! Some imposter!
But, Hildy, I can't. He's accused of stealing a watch. And they found the watch on him.
Now, Hildy --
I can't.
Five hundred dollars.
Well, all right. But I'm liable to get into a jam.
-- You were with her. You were in the cab, weren't you?
I made it up just now, and who's asking you?  I know it's silly, honey, but do it for me, won't you?... Yes, right now.
Thanks. So long, Hildy!
Now don't get excited, Hildy! I don't know what you're talking about -- but is this Mr. Baldwin's wallet?
Is that how you came to shoot the policeman?
Sure you could, Earl -- but you wouldn't want to do that, would you? You wouldn't want to kill anybody.
Oh, I'm awful tired. I couldn't go through another day like this.
They're not human!
Never mind! Just play dead.
Yeah, I'm feelin' fine.
The reprieve for Earl Williams.
Huh?
No, I don't think so.
No, it doesn't.  Now, remember: you never delivered this.  You got caught in the traffic, or something.  Now, get out of here and don't let anybody see you.
No! It's easy -- it's very easy!
You can't bribe me!
You're insane!
Come on, fellas.
Say, Hildy...
Baldwin. The blushing bridegroom -- himself.
Wants Hildy -- and sounds very excited.
She and Mollie were talking.
Henry Chapman's daughter. It was Sheila. I remember her from last year.
Put your hand on mine, get the knack of it.
You're much more convincing when you're making it up.
Yes, you was. Make him talk.
Could.
Ask her yourself.
It's easy. I've done it.
He's the worst liar.
It's dinner time. It really is. Cross my heart.
A bit too quick.
Weeds will grow, Mac.
We didn't know that. It was a suicide mission. Machetes against artillery. Volunteers only.
Well, it's off ration. We know that.
There, there, my baby.
He said I was right. I shouldn't wait for him. I was better to make a clean break.
Now he's gone and made me fall in love with him, which I never wanted to do. I told him that.
It's not. It's happening to me.
Why? It's coming on its own. It doesn't hurt.
Grace!
Play something, Grace.
We did the decent thing.
We can't change what's past. Not even the war can do that.
Look after yourself, Grace.
And now we're glad you did.
Kids don't care. You're thinking of yourself.
Happy as can be. In the old groove.
Enjoy your last night...  ...where's Otis?
Who's your Daddy!
Almost there... are you in a hurry or something?
Are you two gals all funny with each other?
Yeah, I'll do something.
A missing girl. I use'ta go to school with her, she just up and disappeared some day... real weird.
I thought she tried to murder a witness for the prosecution.
Then the devil asks, "do you drink?" Guy says, "yeah"... devil say, "wonderful, Wednesday is free drinks night, best booze you ever had... all made from the finest stuff."
I don't know.
I'll help ya.
Well, technically I did what ya said.
Thanks.
Turn that fucking radio off!
Yeah, showtime for what?
I suppose. I mean they're obviously all bonkers, but I guess they're harmless.
Lock the fucking doors.
I gotta open the gate.
It won't work.
And I gave 'em directions out there, up by the old farm row... I figured what's the harm. Stupid kids probably going out to piss up a rope and got themselves turned around backasswards and got lost as shit.
Yeah, yeah, sure. You don't have to get all True Grit all over my ass... I'll give'm to ya... you can knock yourself silly for all I care.
That kid is one horny retard.
Yeah, I guess, you know next to wacking his weasel his other favorite thing is twisting sharpened pencils in the corner of his eyes.
Naw, he don't do anything else with 'em, but he did get caught once with a Planet of the Apes doll hanging out his asshole.
Had to take him to the hospital. Kid had Dr. Zaius stuck half way up his butt, couldn't get it out.
No dear, I'm fine. Now what kind of host would I be if I put my guests to this kind of work.
What happened? Oh, I'm sorry, it's none of my business.
I don't want to see that.
Oh yeah, murder museum... sounds fun.
It says, "records show that Ellie Thompson was born in 1914 of normal physical stature and lived a life of normal bearings, until such time that she was placed in the care of the Willows State Mental Facility."
I don't...  ...I just thought it was weird.
When?
I don't know, I think he's funny.
I know, but we can make it out of here. We can do it.
Help, help us.
Hopefully I can move things along here and make up the lost time by speeding all the way home... yes, Dad I'm kidding.
No please, let me sit this one out.
Christ, I hope this isn't more crappy folk art. It's so quaint... it's so primal... it's so crap.
Aw, shit...  I gotta pee anyway.
Tell me about it.
Yeah, she said we looked queer.
Not yet.
You find something, Georgie?
His name is Rufus, Rufus Jr., but we all call him R.J.
I'll bet you are... you are a naughty little thing aren't ya.
Oh, you mean on TV.
Aw, come on Jerry. We've gotten all we're gonna get out of this place and its starting to rain.
Huh?
Huh?
Oh, don't blow everything out of proportion.
Enough with the stupid voices.
Negative. Shit, we are so deep in the sticks we could walk for hours and find zero.
No, just a little too old.
Don't worry, I'm gone.
Well, Bill... he's a good guy, he's been great help to me... a real blessing... I couldn't have asked for a better specimen. I mean you don't know what a dry spell I've had, total block...  ...total block... but Bill he's OK.
I ain't sure that you really need to know. It's better you go home still dreaming about your kitty cats and puppy dogs.
Well, go get her.
I ain't got a warrant.
That's it?
I pray to God there is.
Right.
I always favored the Hulk.
Yeah, well I guess it's tough to sit on the sidelines and wait when your own kid's missing... besides, ain't no such thing as an ex-cop.
Right...  ...come on.
We found one.
Nothing! I'll be out in a minute!
Yeah, Natalie. It's hair. It grows.
Really? My day? Well, I had a sweet little mongrel puppie named Puff when I was a girl. This one reminds me of my dog, all shaggy! So cute!  I loved my doggie very much, monsieur.
Merci. I... Do you... would you like to go get a cup of coffee, perhaps?
Not at all.
I like it when you say my name. Is that stupid?
Oui.  Now you've got me talking French.
That would be good.
It's true. I wouldn't lie.
I don't know, Nathan. What are you supposed to do?
Hmmph. Hmmph.  Nathan, we have to talk, you and I.
No! It is now that you must decide.  I love you, Doctor Nathan...  ...but I will not wait. I will not be your chippy. I will not be your little Mademoiselle Parlez-vous side dish.  My love. I want to have a sweet tiny baby inside my belly... from you.
Urgh.
You think too much. I need a man who doesn't think so much but acts more than he thinks... is what I need!
That goddamn Neanderthal? I'm the one who gave him the idea for the combination bug spray-sun screen! Did you know that?!
Please let me go with you.
I want to be the way I was before.
Ouch. Yeah?
Always. Ow.
Tell me. I could use someone up my alley.
What do you mean?
Won't he be able to tell?
Rose, Nathan's no midget, but he's asked me to move in with him.
Nathan told my brother.
That's not necessarily a bad thing.
How's it going?
Tell her, Harold...  It's just that... It's nothing. It's just that the outside fork is the salad fork. One goes from the outside in as the dinner progresses.
I'm sorry that I became so upset.
I like you, too, Nathan.
Nathan!
Terrific. Can't wait!
Yes, darling.
Of course.
What?
It might behoove us to turn back at this point.
What?
Look at him. He doesn't understand English. He moves like an animal.
All right.
Uh-huh. Right, Gabrielle. Right.
You have to shave? Like an ape?
I love being female because it, how do you say, allows me to be close to men.
Please, Nathan. I really need this. You've been working late a lot.
Of course not.
I'm just preoccupied.
Nothing. Hard day. Gonna have a drink.
I had sold my fucking soul.
Oh boy!
Should I come with?
I fucked her! Okay? I fucked her. I'm sorry. But that's what the hell I did.
Lila, you don't intend to hurt us, do you?
Ooka.
And because you did so well, we have a little surprise for you.
Now, my diminutive friend, what can I do for you?
Oh please, is that as articulate as you can be after all the time I spent teaching you? We've discussed Wittgenstein, for Christ's sake. Not that you ever had anything very original or challenging to say on the subject.
No.
Yep.
I know. Been there myself. We've all been there, haven't we, Miss Packard?
She's a smart girl, Eddie.
Thank you.
That's the way it's done.
You ever played billiards before?
Deal the cards.
It's possible.
The night is two thousand dollars old.
Cash.
Cut.
Yeah? Why?
I lost twenty bucks.
You being cute?
Maybe he knows how to drink.
Okay, okay... What do I do now, lie down on the floor and, uh, bow from the ankles? What do I do, go home?
To do what?
You saw me beat Minnesota Fats for eighteen thousand dollars.
I'd say my game is about twenty per cent off. Maybe more.
Maybe you oughta give me lessons.
Like I told ya. My thumbs.
Miss Packard. How do you do?
Good. I'd hate to think I was putting my money on a cripple.
You hustlin' me?
How're the hands?
You gotta be hard, Eddie.
I'm a businessman, kid.
What's your game? What do you shoot?
Will you shut up... Just give me a drink.
What are ya, chicken, Charlie?
So am I... Sit down.  Would you get us a couple of drinks?
Talk to me, Charlie.
Aah! I've got no stomach for that any more. I've had that kind of life.
Never been out of it. I'm gonna beat that fat man... with that curly hair, and those diamond rings, and that carnation.
Don't worry about it. I'll raise the money.
What's the difference where? I'll raise it.  Is it all right if I have another drink?
Yeah. Just like that.
Well, hello. Haven't seen you in a long time.
Now and then. Why, do you?
You're very direct, Mr. Felson.
I don't play pool, Mr. Felson. I play billiards. My house, my game. You don't have to play if you don't want to.
Yeah, sure has.
Call it.
Yeah, I'm quittin'.
Around.
Cramped.  You always drink like this, so early in the morning?
I'm the emancipated type. Real emancipated.
I'm not.
I wanted to see what kind of a day it is.
What did you say that for, Sarah?
Eggs. How do you like them?
What's this supposed to mean?
More like a week. Look, I'll be back.
Come here. Come on, now.
If you were going to come back you wouldn't have taken me out tonight. You wouldn't have bought this dress. You're hustling me, Eddie. You've never stopped hustling me.
I'd know it, Eddie. I'd know. For God's sakes, what are you trying to do to me? I love you.
I'll be up later.
Why?
Well, what's the matter?
Would you get off my back, Sarah? Once and for all, will you get out, will you GET OFF MY BACK?!
Fats, let's you and I shoot a game of straight pool.
Nine ball.  Three ball.
Mm hm... Two ball, side pocket.
That's good, Eddie. For how much?
Let's go.
My name is Robert.
Dark and large.  With vines -- no, not vines.  Not alive.
What do you mean?
We don't know that --
Besides, if we get a lot of work done this summer it'll be done.
I'm am architect.  I'm working on a site back in --
If we want it, it is.
Because the sky is so clear out here.
It was all made of stuff that's happened to you in the last few days.  The sand pit in back of the house, and the meteor shower, and meeting your teacher and the colonel at school, and being afraid of the new kids because you don't know them ...
I will.  But isn't that odd -- about my dream ... ?
That's Ed.  Ed works with the Bell Telephone switching division.
Yes -- but ...
Why, yes.  Why?
I understand, Miss, that you have my son in your office.
About what?
But it's not, Jimmy.
They didn't find any signs of life on the Viking missions.
What? -- I... 
I'll pack us a lunch.  Hamburgers. You always like that, don't you.
Gardner?  Oh, um -- he's a new student. Just moved here.  Why?
If we do, we'll both die virgins. But at last we'll be together.
David, don't...
He's a good man.
My ex-husband works in satellite communications.
Think nothing of it, Spanky.
All he could think about was getting to you. There's still love there I think.
All you need is love. John Lennon. Smart man. Shot in the back, very sad.
It was turned on. I was ignoring you. What's the big emergency?
What happened?
Checkmate.
Three years.
College nickname.
Because last time I saw him I punched him in the face.
We've gotta burn the rain forest, Pops. Dump toxic waste, pollute the air, rip up the ozone. Maybe if we screw this planet up enough they won't want it anymore.
You as well.
I'm a pilot, Will. This is where I belong.
Please, you're not buying into any of this nonsense, are you? We don't have the manpower or the resources to launch that kind of a campaign.  Not to mention that this whole cockamamie plan is dependent on a machine that no one in the world is qualified to operate.
No Sir. Definitely not.
Well, er... it's slowing down.
It's... slowing down, Sir.
What?
Naw. I'll just tell my other girlfriends they can't come over tonight.
Butt-munch.
No. Exotic.
Don't get premature on me, Jimmy. We don't light up 'til the Fat Lady sings.
We're already over Mach 2!
Jimmy, stay with me.
We should leave too.
Not all too dissimilar to us. Breathes oxygen, comparable tolerances to heat, cold... probably why they're interested in our planet.  Hey, you wanna see them?
Marcus Brody, sir. And where is Indy?
And I am his.
You've got it!
It's today's mail. And it's been opened.
What is it?
I don't know. But someone must want it pretty badly.
Your father would know. Your father did know. Look. He made a map.
Arghhh! Oh!
What?
Don't worry. Doctor Schneider will be there to meet you.
Don't take that tone with me, my good man. Now buttle off and tell Baron Brunwald that Lord Clarence MacDonald and his lovely assistant are here to view the tapestries.
The Holy Grail, Doctor Jones. The chalice used by Christ during the Last Supper. The cup that caught His blood at the Crucifixion and was entrusted to Joseph of Arimathaea.
Every man's dream.  Including your father's, I believe.
What good is it? This Grail Tablet speaks of deserts and mountains and canyons. Pretty vague. Where do you start looking? Maybe if the Tablet were intact, you'd have something to go on. But the entire top portion is missing.
We're through!
Are you sure?
Look at the artistry of these carvings and the scrollwork.
You said go between them!
Where is it? I want it.
Yet you stood up to be counted with the enemy of everything the Grail stands for -- who gives a damn what you think?
I can reach it. I can reach it...
Don't call me that, please.
And the head.  You hit me, Dad!
Alexandretta... of course... on the pilgrim trail from the Eastern Empire. Oh, Junior...
There were rats, Dad.
Well, uh...
Umh?
You said he had two days' start. That he would blend in. Disappear!
All right, move! Move! Rock your Chair. Do what I do.
Head for the fireplace!
What?
What about Marcus?
That's not all we shared. It's disgraceful. You're old enough to be her fa... er, her grandfather!
And do I detect a rebuke?
More or less.  Son, I'm sorry. They got us.
Thanks.
I know, Dad!
Dad, we're well out of range.
You call this archaeology?
Junior...
I can get it -- I can almost reach it, Dad.
Junior?! Dad...
That was seven hundred years ago.
I'll take the camels.
I didn't come for the Cup of Christ. I came to find my father.
No. But I am interested in the occult. And this is a kryta.
Even if they were trying to scare us away, a devout Hindu would never touch meat.  Makes you wonder what these people are...
It's some kind of cult! And they've got the sacred stones that Indy was searching for.
I'm afraid they'll kill them! We saw horrible things down there -- they had a human sacrifice and they ripped a man's heart out!
Maybe... but how do you explain The Thuggee shrine I saw right below the palace?
And didn't the Sultan of Madagascar threaten to cut your head off if you ever returned to his country?
Kali Ma protects us now and for ever, and we must pledge our devotion by worshipping her with an offering of flesh and blood!
A bonus, Dr. Jones. That is poison. You just drank the rest of it.
It's just superstition, Shorty. Like a ghost story.
Nope, you got a little surprise over there, Shorty.
No.
Two are still missing.
You are in no position to give orders, Dr. Jones.
Mola Ram -- you're about to meet Kali -- in Hell!
They say we must pray to their evil god. We say we will not.
Don't get your hopes up -- where's the antidote?
He told me they knew I was coming here.
That's more food than these people eat in a week.  They're starving, too...
Stark naked? You wish... If you're trying to seduce me, Dr. Jones, this is a very primitive approach.
Just one arm!
Is that what you're hoping to find at this palace, Dr. Jones?
What does the writing say?
Yeah, I wish you'd thought of this sooner...
You're talking to an authority in that area.
You want me so bad, why don't you invite me?
I think you're too used to getting you own way, Willie...
Don't catch cold.
You're dreaming, Willie. You want to make it real, just knock on my door.
I'm coming, what's the rush?! Ohh! What's that?! There's stuff all over the floor! I can't see a thing!
That's it -- the release lever -- look inside!
Quiet!
I'm going down.
I'm not leaving without those stones.
What above the curves?!
Yeah -- this time you're gonna help!
And they don't even know what it really is.
They don't cry about you. They cry about the elephants leaving.
They got no food to feed them. So they taking the elephants away to sell them.
You're not gonna believe this...
I'm...inside you.
Yes?
Yes.
What is your name?
What street?
Where are we now?
You said it.
Then I'm crazy.
You're gonna explain.
Yes...Yes...I'll explain it all. Just put the gun down.
With a man in my head...
Who was that? Somebody out there?
Sorry...all this...buzzing in my head.  Why don't I just take you back to UST?
Why not?
Oh...Gooood!
Nothing. Just the cyclist. He's passed us.
Outrun them.
Then what are you stopping for?
See the codelock? Punch this in. 26993
What do you mean?
That's it. They know I'm in here. We've got to find them.
They think we're safe here. They don't really need us. They're probably long gone.
You are not alone. But you are incon- picuous...and, with our abilities...
We get on a plane.
What about it?
Nothing, but it's yours. Change it. Change your whole persona.
You'll be me.
Just get there.
What is it?
Good Idea!
I'm living on freeze dried limas and ham. Just eat it.
She's beautiful...! What do I do?
What's happening?
Try another language.
...Rene...
Maybe they won't stand on ceremony.
Why not?!
What glasses.
The blond...GRUNER. A killer.
How do you know?
Your data must be bad. Everyone can't be lying all the time.
This just won't work.
Not her. You!
Shit! You're in love.
You found her.
That's good. It's not better. Where?
Osaka?
Run, stupid!
Down to your heart. I'm gonna clean some fat out before you drop on me.
It is a blank. This is no time for Zen.
I know she's not with them. I know something else. What's bothering you isn't her.
Trying to analyze this stuff. Now...go to the medicine shelf and take ---- and ----.
You were with GRUNER!
You said 100,000 yen for the right Sony Walkman.
He didn't. He left us that walkman chip to confuse us. Would have kept most people busy. We were too fast for him.
Just fine. I'll do the driving from now on.
Aim what?
GRUNER switched the chip to him, not from him, then he led us away again...to Chiang Cho.
What exactly?
Looks like you can have all you want.
Rene?
You've changed your mind.
You're lovely.
I want you to know how much I appreciate what you've done.
I'll get us out of here.
That's nice.
RYUJI Bandaio. Grown near here.
Aren't we all.
What part what?
I insist.
Trouble...is, if we both get stuck here.
What a nerve!
Who's our little man?
Doesn't matter. Then put him away.
We met on the beach.
Yes. Joe.
He's not an ordinary man.
And how do you service foreigners.
I came for a rest. As, I imagine, you did. To get away with it all.
I think I've heard of you.
Oh.
Remember what?
Thanks.
Here?
Oh....Sure.
Nothing.
Yes?
Oh...I can't. Business.
I just work for the travel firm.
You are.
Why'd you run off?
Wanted to get to know you.
They kidded me a little.
I'm sorry. What will you do?
What's he done?
Oh sure.
Must be a pick-up, a rendezvous.
We figure out if it's in here.
I asked him.
He's a client of mine! What's the matter. You can't suspect Dieter. He's a famous photographer. He makes millions.
...across THE BORDER. Come on!
They asked about you.
They'll listen to what we say in here.
Why?
Why did you, then?
I was...crazy...desperate. I took it out on you. I didn't mean it. I know what she sees in you. You're kind and you're brave. If I ever get out of you, I'll be glad to call you my friend.
Why not, what are you going to do?
Her?
Doesn't matter. I'm on your side.
It was you.
I told you, I work for him.
We're not moving fast enough for him.
I know a nice island.
It is?
Just one. The back up.
Leaving, now go to sleep. ...all of you.
Yes.
Perfectly.
Poor bastard.
Whoever took it does.
What's that outside, Daddy?
In the backyard.
Oh, for God's sake, what has this guy got, a horse fetish?
Excuse me, Lowell. Sharon's on line 3.
Get me Wigand.
Good.
It's an alternate version. So what if we have an alternate version? And I don't think her being cautious is so damned unreasonable.
C'mon, what are you? And are you a businessman? Or are you a newsman?! Because that happens to be what Mike and I do for a living...
I'm not implying. I'm quoting. More vested interests...  "Persons Who Will Profit From This Merger...  Ms. Helen Caperelli, General Counsel of CBS News, 3.9 million. Mr. Eric Kluster, President of CBS News, 1.4 million..."
If we could take a look, Mr. Wigand...
Yes, I do. A .38 Target Master. In my gun safe downstairs. A .45 Gold Cup. A .22 target pistol. So what?
Yes. Yes, I do.  Yes, I get extremely emotional when assholes put bullets in my mailbox...!
Okay. 
No, no, we're fine...
And, I'm told there are questions as to our "star witness'" veracity.
You're getting ahead of yourself. We're all in this together. We're all CBS. We'll find out soon. Thank you, gentlemen.
Call me back in ten.
Okay.  Lowell?
Hey, it doesn't work? You've burned your bridges, man.
Thomas Sandefur...
No, thank you.
Can we talk about this when I get back?
"60 Minutes"?
Hello? Yeah...
I can't... I've got to fly to Boston tomorrow.
Jeffrey...
You're not listening.  Really know what you're going to do before you do it.
No. No, it's okay... How's -- how's the new place?
Okay. Thank you.
Good, well ask him if Arabic is his second language.
You eating with us?
What "Seven Dwarfs?"
Hardly new news.
What do you mean?
These people are putting our whole reason for doing what we do... on the line!
What?
No, I usually sit around in my hotel room, dressed like this at 5:30 in the morning, sleepy look on my face.
You and I have been doing this together for fourteen years.
Because I think Hezbollah is trying to broaden into a political party right now. So you care about what you're thought of in America. And in America, at this moment in time, Hezbollah does not have a face.  That's why.
Black, black...
What are you talking about? Where are you?
Good. I want to talk to you.
It was on C-SPAN. Yeah.
I can't talk about it. The work I was supposed to do... might have had some positive effect. I don't know... it could have been beneficial.  Mostly, I got paid a lot. I took the money. My wife was happy. My kids had good medical. Good schools. Got a great house.  I mean, what the hell is wrong with that...?
Then... you're in a state of conflict, Jeff.
I'm not pushing you around!  I'm asking you questions.
You believe that because you get information out to people... something happens?
Maybe that's just what you've been telling yourself all these years to justify having a good job? Having status? And maybe for the audience, it's just voyeurism? Something to do on a Sunday night. And maybe it won't change a fucking thing. And people like myself and my family are left hung out to dry. Used up! Broke, alone!
They're terrorizing us. Death threats?! To my family? My kids?!
...to talk about it. To think about it. I had a plan to ease her into it. But, I really -- I didn't know how to do that...
I heard.
She sued you for back payments of child support?
What?
I told the truth... I told the truth.
Jeffrey, where you going with this? So where you goin'?  You are important to a lot of people, Jeffrey. You think about that. You think about them.
I'm on a leave of absence. Forced vacation.
Yeah. Yeah, I will.
She's okay.
What do you mean followed you? Did you call the police?
You called me.
Good to meet you, Dr. Wigand.
Dr. Wigand, you do understand what could happen, don't you?
"The former executive has reason to bet on being sued, for major cigarette manufacturers..."
Possibly, yes. That is one of the possible consequences of your testifying here today. That's right...
Chapter and verse.
I appreciate all that, Jeff. But, upon reflection... we've decided to expand our zone of comfort with you.
Howard!
We'd better go before we get thrown out.
Few suicide attempts, little inpatient stint. Naturally, she misses her kids. Six weekends a year and alternate Yom Kippurs seemed harsh to us but -- hey -- all's fair. Anyhoo, she lives with a "nurse," takes her meds and goes to occupational therapy at a local sheltered workshop.
She makes felt wallets. Got one right here.
Well -- Marylin and Rex broke up and...
I just want to make sure that you both --
Is that... one person?
Mr. Dumbarton is, yes.
Shut up. I was a lawyer. Just like you. And my clients? Whores just like you.
So. I won't be seeing her? Your clients usually visit me after the settlement.
Everyone needs plastic surgery. You need it.
You want Botox?
No frown lines.  New watch?
Set one side for Bel Air.
We did not.
I was going to play golf. You were going to have Asian girlfriends.
I should be in therapy.
Miles! Don't waste time with someone else's queen, either.
Marvin says that Rex's will is four years old. He never redrafted it.
He manufactures staples and industrial brad-tacks. He's very successful.
Ruth Rabino.
In the Godfather, after the courtroom scene, Frankie Pentangeli opens his veins in the bathtub.
It's about time.
Oh boy. If he only knew.
I'll be right back.
Positano is beautiful. Remember when we were there, Rex? We stayed in the Santo Pietro? That hotel on the cliff?
See the tape. Then we can discuss my heart.
You don't believe in it.
Oh, I'm a lot like you -- just looking for an ass to mount.
Have you ever met Mr. Rexroth?
To him? He's a sick freak.
Although knowing you as I do -- there will be no settlement. This time it will be complete and total annihilation.
I don't feel victorious Miles. I feel betrayed, abandoned and humiliated. I have pictures of him with another woman...
You really think I engineered the whole thing. You think the marriage and the divorce was part of some scheme. You came here to celebrate because you think I'm without morality or soul. You --  sound like my mother.
You're right about me. I am worthless. I am nothing. I don't deserve to live.
Yes. I just got that, actually. It was a gift.
Me. Yes.
Yeah. Mom. Mom and brother.
No.
Did you just propose to me?
Yes.
I know.
I want this to be a marriage based on love, trust and community property. That's all I've ever wanted.
Well, I suppose I could "girly" it up for you with a little Fortuny, and some passementerie --
The IRS? They owe me. I'm expecting a refund.
What kind of "stuff?"
Those are gifts.
Marylin!
It's not something I wanted either.
Yes. I know. It's exactly how I felt when I realized you'd hired the goon to kill...
Your forgetting Rex Rexroth?
Murder?
Marylin.
Like I know his intention? Or yours for that matter?  I should join Sam. I'm too old for this bullshit.
Well what does he want?
So, Marylin. Is that what you said when you were a little girl?
It's not Ming. It's Tong.
He would invite these girls home from the staple factory to our condominium in Palm Springs. He had a device he called the Intruder.
Yes?
Marylin Rexroth? When does she --
Yes. Maybe you're right, Miles. Maybe we're being too conservative. Seventy five percent.
No. Not exactly. It didn't exactly cool. Marylin is a knock-out. And very sexy -- but -- there's a lot of it out there.
I don't know. I can assume...
I'm not sure.
Sorry.
No. You're not.
What...?
I'd stay away from her, Miles.
Mother?
Well, not just divorce. She used to say "I want to be divorced from some big dumb rich guy..." And I guess her dream is coming true.  I'm happy for you Patty
Muriel Rumsey.
What I'm asking isn't impossible. My daughter is somewhere between here and Miami. I want her found!
It's not enough!  Are you certain she's not with King Westley?
That's typical of your daughter. Takes those things for granted.  Why does she think I lugged her all the way from Miami—  for the love of it?
Oh, she does, huh? Isn't that sweet of her! You don't , I suppose.
If I didn't I wouldn't be here!  I've got it all itemized. 
The reward.
You're a peculiar chap.
A guy that'd fall in love with your daughter should have his head examined.
She grabbed herself a perfect running mate. King Westley! The pill of the century!  What she needs is a guy that'd take a sock at her every day—whether it's coming to her or not.
I asked you a question. Do you love her?
All right! Put me in chains! Do anything you want!  But I'm not going to eat a thing until you let me off this boat!
If Gandhi had a chef like Paul, it would change the whole political situation in India.
I'll get it annulled.
You're going to finance him, I suppose.
I won't thank you! I'll never thank you!
Oh, yes. I heard.
Sorry, Dad. I wouldn't hurt you for the world. You know that.
On the road.
He's marvelous!
No, I'll go through with it.
She hasn't had a thing yesterday—or today.
Terrible! Nothing terrible about her. She's great! Marvelous youngster! Got a mind of her own. Knows just what she wants.  She's not going to get it though. She won't get very far. Has no money.
I haven't the slightest idea.
There's another wire from Peter, sir. They're in Glen Falls, Michigan.
But the lady says—
Thanks.
Tonsil? Me? No! Me burn a tonsil?  "My tonsils won't burn— As life's corners I . . .
What're you gonna do about the papers? Somebody's gotta pick 'em up.
Maybe they do—and maybe they don't.
Yeah. I knew you'd catch on eventually.
Don't tell me your ticket was in it?
What are you excited about? You missed the bus, too.
Will you please tell me what you're raving about!
I didn't ask for your advice. 
You're not going to notify my father, are you?
Yeah. Yeah, it's a gift. 
Yeah. Yeah, not bad. How's your's?
Oh, this?—I like privacy when I retire. I'm very delicate in that respect. Prying eyes annoy me.  Behold the walls of Jericho![4] Maybe not as thick as the ones that Joshua blew down with his trumpet, but a lot safer. You see, I have no trumpet.  Now just to show you my heart's in the right place, I'll give you my best pair of pajamas.
Not at all. 
Why, you sweet thing, you. Where'd you get it pressed? 
Your hair's cute like that. You should never comb it.
I thought maybe—uh—"believe you me" told you a couple of snappy stories.
Santa Claus?
Oh. Is that how you met him?
Well, you were!
Next week "East Lynne."
What's the matter?
What do you mean—starvation?
To New York?
My uncle—Mother's brother—had four children . . . and I've seen them ride "piggy-back."
That's silly.
We're not going to sleep out here, are we?
Doesn't sound very exciting.
Needn't rub it in.  What're you eating?
Raw?
No!!  It's a wonder you couldn't get me something I can eat.
I hate the horrid stuff.
You're an expert, I suppose.
You're such a smart aleck! Nobody can do anything but you. I'll show you how to stop a car—and I won't use my thumb.
Just a road thief. Picks people up and runs off with their stuff. What a racket! 
I'm glad you think so. If you ask me, it's foolish. I told you there's no sense in our staying here tonight. We could make New York in less than three hours.
I would. But I've got a weak stomach.
Why, you bully. I believe you would.
You can't be hungry and scared at the same time.
You sound like a hobo.
Yep! The Walls of Jericho. 
Eight o'clock! Why, that's twelve hours!
Believe you me, you bore me to distraction.
If you don't get out of here, I'll slap that fresh mouth of yours.
What time is it?
What's 'at?
Bridge washed out—around Dawson.
Yeah? Where?
That's okay by me! 'Cause as far as I'm concerned, I'm through with newspapers! See? I'm through with stupidity! I'll never write another newspaper story, for you or anybody else, if I have to starve.  Yeah? What about my novel! When I get through with that—
Don't get sore, Joe. This is something you got to do for me. I need a thousand dollars—and I need it quick. I'm in a jam.
Never mind . . . Listen—suppose I should tell you that Ellen Andrews is going to have her marriage annulled.
Would an exclusive story like that be worth a thousand bucks to you?
Sure. I wouldn't blame you, either.
Well, I'll be—
When you sober up—come in and see me.
Yeah, but I got a bag. My wife gave me one for Christmas.
I ain't got a hat.
They're married all right. I just seen the license.
Said he was gonna stay a week.
Who?
Looks like it, don't it?  Here's the woman, ma.
Better start gettin' into your clothes.
Looks like we're going to be stuck for a long time. 
That's right.
What?
Okay. Just remember that. Now beat it.
When you're in a war, boss, you use every weapon you got.
Because you keep conning me, Dean. I read your testimony to the Warren Commission and...
Like I told to the Washington boys, Bertrand called that summer and asked me to help the kid upgrade his Marine discharge...
There were no phone records.
Frank, I don't want to hear it.
Twenty dollars each time.  Hell, it's no secret.  That's what I'm here for.
Y'ever heard of a double agent, Bill? I'm beginning to doubt Oswald was ever a Communist... after the arrest, 544 Camp Street never appeared on the pamphlets again.  Now here's another one for you:  What would you say if I told you Lee Oswald had been trained in the Russian language when he was a Marine?
Does that bother you, Bill?  I always wondered in court why it is because a woman is a prostitute, she has to have bad eyesight.
Let's start making some assumptions about the man.  Why would he leave a path as big as Lee Harvey Oswald's? This is not a thin trail, gentlemen, it is a very wide one.  Who found the evidence?  Who set him up?  Lou, Bill, Susie, I want you to go back and check all the sightings of Oswald in Dallas, New Orleans and Mexico in the summer and fall of '63 - see if it's the same guy.
Where you going, boss?
Oh, now you're saying Lyndon Johnson was involved?  The President of the United States?
Maybe 'cause there's some rogue element in the Government!
I don't see any violence, Jim.  Heart attack, maybe an aneurysm.  Looks like natural causes.
Calm down, Dave, what?
Dave, just calm down.  Meet me in the lobby of the Fontainbleau in 20 minutes.  I'll have a suite reserved for you under an assumed name.
Yeah.  Come on, Dave, come on our side.  I guarantee you the boss'll protect you...  Dave?
Photographs - compromising stuff. And he'll use 'em.  The Agency plays for keeps...  I knew Oswald.  He was in my Civil Air Patrol unit.  I taught him everything.  A "wanna be," y'know, nobody really liked him cause he was a snitch.  I treated him good.  He'd talk about his kid, y'know, really wanted her to grow up with a chance, but... He got a raw deal.  The Agency fucked him.  Just like they're gonna fuck me.
I'm sure you've seen this.  Perhaps you knew this man under another name?
What was so appealing about Houston?
Dave, may I ask why the urge to go ice skating in Texas happened to strike you during one of the most violent thunderstorms in recent memory?
And then Sunday?
Dave, I find your story simply not believable.
Oh man, why don't you stop.  This is too fuckin' big for you!  Who did Kennedy?  It's a mystery wrapped in a riddle inside an enigma.  Even the shooters don't fuckin' know!  Don't you get it yet?  I can't be talking like this.  They're gonna kill me. I'm gonna die!  I don't know what happened.  All I wanted in the world was to be a Catholic priest - live in a monastery, study ancient Latin manuscripts, pray, serve God.  But I had this one terrible, fatal weakness.  They defrocked me.  And then I started to lose everything.
Get some rest, Dave, and you'll feel better in the morning.  We'll talk then.
Well, I am saying it.  Bring in the jury.
There's nothing wrong with feeling a little scared, Jasper, Virginia. Telling the truth can be a scary thing.  It scared President Kennedy, but he was a brave man.  If you let yourself be too scared, then you let the bad guys take over the country, don't you - and then everybody gets scared.
Look, do you want the truth, or just what you want me to say?
I was scared.  It was all kinda queer, but it sure felt like two and two was coming up three... and then they took Mary's five snapshots from me, sent them to Washington, and when they returned them weeks later, two of them had the backgrounds mutilated... The only one we saved was in Mary's camera.  I didn't want to go to Washington when the Warren Commission subpoenaed me... so the lawyer come down here and interviewed me at Parkland Hospital.
I know.
Well... in an investigation we're conducting your name has come up a number of times.
David Ferrie.
That's what bothers me, Mr. Garrison. You see, they've been altered.  My statements...
Well maybe you're right, Jim.  I'll give you one hour to solve the case... until the kids are in bed.  Then you're mine and Mr. Kennedy can wait 'til morning.  Come on, everybody say goodnight to Daddy.
Liz, do I have to spell it out for you?  Lee Oswald was no ordinary soldier.  That was no accident he was in Russia.  He was probably in military intelligence.  That's why he was trained in Russian.
But why in the Lord's name would you do it in the middle of Easter Sunday when you knew we were...
Liz, I'm really sorry.  The meeting went much longer than expected.
It's not funny, Jim, I'm scared.
Our home, Jim!  A kidnapper, a murderer, who knows!
How do you know?  How do you even know what goes on in this house anymore!  You're too busy making speeches, stirring up every crazed Klansman in Louisiana after us!
I'm not fighting you, Jim, I'm just trying to reach you.  You've changed.
You never talked to me this way before, Jim Garrison.  I'm not making any threats.  I'm leaving you.  I'm taking the kids to my mother's.  I am - I am.
I remember he had some kinda thing wrong with his left leg.  He limped. Don't get me wrong, he's not one of those, you know, limp wrists.  He's a butch John.  You'd meet him on the street, you'd never snap.  You could go fishing with him, play poker with him, you'd never snap in a million years.  So one night we were over at Ferrie's place.  Having a party. Sometime in the late summer of '63.
And it ain't pretty  ..."the AD has spent more than $8,000 on unexplained travel and investigative expenses since November, 1966.
The Warren Commission call him?
If I were investigatin', I'd round up the 100 best riflemen in the world and find out which ones were in Dallas that day.  You been duck hunting?  I think Oswald was a good old-fashioned decoy.  What'd he say?  "I'm just a patsy."  Out of the mouth of babes y'ask me.
I've been called everything under the sun, Jerry.  Call me whatever you like.
I've already been warned by the Agency, Mr. Whoever.  If this is another type of threat, I don't...
Kings are killed, Mr. Garrison. Politics is power, nothing more. But don't believe me.  Don't trust me.  Do your own work, your own thinking.
No chance in hell, Mr. Garrison. I'd be arrested and gagged, declared insane and hospitalized... maybe worse.  You, too.  I can only give you background, you got to find the foreground, the little things... Keep digging.  Y'know you're the only person to ever bring a trial in the murder of John Kennedy.  That's important - it's historic.
I think it started in the wind. Money - arms, big oil, Pentagon people, contractors, bankers, politicians like L.B.J. were committed to a war in Southeast Asia.  As early as '61 they knew Kennedy was going to change things... He was not going to war in Southeast Asia.  Who knows? Probably some boardroom or lunchroom somewhere - Houston, New York - hell, maybe Bonn, Germany... who knows, it's international now.
Any chance of one of them confessing someday?
More than ten years.
I didn't say that.  All I know is he died suddenly just before the Warren Report came out.
Anything more specific, Jack?  It's important.
There was one guy, I don't know, big guy, business guy, white hair - I saw him come into the office once. He looked out of place, y'know - like a society guy.  Can't remember his name.  Oswald was with him.
You just need some sleep, Lou.  It won't look so bad when...
She's the best damn witness we have!
That's it.
And what would I have to do?
Virginia.
Mr. Ruby, I really can't see why you can't tell us now.
Well I don't know what can be done, Mr. Ruby, because I don't know what you anticipate we will encounter.
Three years.
Naw, man. I gotta be someplace. I was kinda hopin you could come with me.
Let me finish. Can I finish?
You think I wanted to spend ten thousand dollars on your ass?
I told Jackie, and Jackie said you wanted him.
She almost sounds scared.
What time do you have to be there?
The usual things. I'm a flight attendant with Cabo Air.
What's her name?
I thought you might want a drink?
What's your brand?
Was she helpful?
I had 'em too. I burnt those two Starky and Hutch motherfuckers down. Then their asses lucked out and found that coke.
Ask A.T.F. They might give you permission.
You went out this morning and bought a gun?
It looks nice.
I got a few. But I can't afford to start all over again. I got too much time and money invested in my records.
Uh-huh.
He called you?
If I get let off. Otherwise, fuck 'em.
I just feel like I'm always starting over. You said how many bonds you wrote?
I know, ignoring me. What're you up to?
What'd ya see?
How was it?
Oh, are you? Does she know that?
For now. These relationships never last too long.
They seem to like the idea.
Yea, but I'm going to dress it up. Put the money in a shopping bag and hand it to someone I meet here.
Right around here, in the food court.
Not really. But I knew this narcotics cop one time. Told me that in a raid, the whole package never gets back to the station. His exact words.
If I saw a way to walk off with a shopping bag full of money, would I take it?
When did you decide?
More or less.
Which one?
You know, a good cop won't let you know he knows you're fulla shit.
Don't be so literal. Ray believed it.
Well, you know I'm not going to show him the whole amount. He'll see fifty thousand.
Yeah, but I'm not in jail and I tried.
People talk to Winston. He's street, same as them, they trust him. They get busted, they know somebody who can bond them out. I thought I might drop in on him. He'll no doubt be surprised to see me.
I hesitated taking that much.
I'm fifty-five-years old. I can't blame anybody for anything I do.
I'm just tired in general.
I beg your pardon?
You know what's in the bag you're taking?
What the fuck is that shit?
You planted that shit on me.
You never asked me if I did or not.
Short of wearing a wire, I'll do everything I can to help you throw his ass in jail. And in exchange for my help, I need permission to leave the country and immunity.
A Broadway shopping bag.
What's her story?
What did you say?
But she mentioned Beaumont by name?
Oh, that's taken care of. I called the State Attorney's Office. You were no-filed this morning in Circuit Court.
I was told ten thousand in each pack.
I never have. It's not my money.
Not in the fitting room.
You'd take a polygraph on it?
I thought you were watching him.
What about me?
Buy ya a beer?
He told me to go outside.  "You may leave us now." It's all part of his pathetic attempt to be "the man." You know Mr. Walker don't you?
You believe that? Yeah, well, I guess you have to trust him.  I'd have second thoughts on that, but then I know 'em.
Kinda.
Hi, Melanie.
Yeah, do you like it?
Who you think got your ass outta jail?
Go sit over in that chair.
Baby, I didn't --
But you don't?
I got the woman covered. Where you thinkin' about doin' this?
I'll give ya ten.
The fitting room. There's a sign over the door.
I'm impressed. He knows a lot.
Four days ago.
Yeah, there's another hit left.
The roller disco one.
Yeah.
I went to a few just to meet women. But I don't like to dance, and it's so fuckin; loud. During that whole scene I just drank in bars.  Who didn't make the cut?
You been to Japan?
Who's arm is that?
That sounds like a problem.
Now that's over, let's get to know each other.
So what are you trying to tell me? I should get out of here?
Does that bother you?
Just stay right fuckin' here, all right?
Who's your partner?
That was Beaumont.
That's not what I meant when I asked did you trust her.
Yep.
Well, why the fuck keep her around?
That's what I gotta tell you. She bugged me the whole time. Got pissy with me 'cause I wouldn't let her carry the bag. Started running her fuckin' mouth... I couldn't remember right away when we came out where the car was parked, so she got on me about that. "Is it this aisle Lou- is, is it that one?" She was totally fuckin' with my nerves.
Maybe... but at that moment... I dunno...
How much it there?
That's why I never checked it. The bag felt right.
Tell me.
Where would you like me to put my ash?
Beaumont ain't going nowhere.  Where do I sign?
They fuckin' wit' her. They callin' it Possession with Intent. A black woman in her forties gets busted with less than two ounces on her, they call that shit Intent. Same shit happened to a movie star. It's Possession.
She had, I believe it was... fifty grand on her, too. There was a cop at the hearing. Young guy with L.A.P.D. wanted her bond set at twenty- five thousand, saying there was a risk of flight. Jackie being a stewardess and all.
You want me to speculate on what you do. I'd say you're in the drug business, except the money's moving in the wrong direction. Whatever you're into, you seem to be getting away with it, so more power to you. Okay you want another bond, and you want to move over the ten thousand you put down on Beaumont to the stewardess. That means paperwork. I have to get a death certificate, present it to the court, fill out a receipt for return of bond collateral, then type up another application. An indemnity agreement --
If I don't see it in front of me, you're right. It ain't shit.
Ordell, this isn't a bar, an you don't have a tab.
Falsely accused? She didn't come back from Mexico with cocaine on her?
She wants to give it to you herself and collect her ten percent. She also wants to explain why she had to hold on to it.
And you did that to protect my interest?
You get used to it after a while. Now tell me where my money's at.
That I gotta see.
I know where it is.
It's Beaumont.
Not if your ambition is to get high and watch TV.
I was gonna tell you...
He leave town?
No, thanks.
Just to see you. That's all.
Hello, Sam.
No, don't. But thanks.
How do you know?
Frank. It's Jake. Jacob SInger.
Maybe the demons are real.
Gabe?  What are you doing ... ?
Ah! I thought you were a mailman.
Ah! Well then, they're going to have to pay for that, aren't they?
He told me he was going to Hell.
Her knee acting up?
Wiggle your toes.
I had to get in there. A deep adjustment. Rest a moment and let it set a bit.
I'm walking, aren't I?
The postal service. I'm a mailman.
I doubt it's my mind that interests her. I tell you Prof, she's a fiery lady.
See them?  What do you mean? Physically?
Have you considered a doctor? A psy- chiatrist?
I'm afraid, Prof. Nothing makes sense.  Please help me.
Jacob Singer.
Of course not. You have all the blankets. It must be ten degrees in here. I'm telling you, Sarah, if you want to sleep with fresh air, you sleep on the fire escape. From now on that window is closed.
Guilty thoughts. See what happens when you cheat on me, even in your mind?
I thought you said it was a nightmare?
Goddamn it. I want Louis.
No. Have you seen my glasses?
The best.
Gabe.
Now? What about the boss? He's not gonna like it.
They weren't human!
Where?
If I could stop it, I'd stop it.
I don't believe this. I'm calling the doctor.
Get your clothes off.
That's your decision.
Lie down!
You are the most unbelievable woman I have ever met. One second you're a screaming banshee and the next you're Florence Nightingale. Who are you? That's what I want to know. Will the real Jezzie Pipkin please stand up.
Underneath all the bullshit, just love.
He did? When?
Why didn't you call me?
What? What do you mean?
Jezzie?
Let go!
Yep. Finally. I love you, Jez.
I tell you, it was so wonderful. I felt like a little boy. I saw Paradise, Jezzie.
Stick with me, kid.
No. Things are too hot. Later. I'll send for you.
I'm okay. I just don't want to lis- ten.
Goddamn it. Why do you say that?
Shit! Can't I just have a bad day?
Mid-town mostly.
Wake up! Stop playing with yourself. It's finished.
Yeah, sure. We were losing the war.
Like it was yesterday.
A couple of days later. It was fierce. You guys never saw it.
Yeah. But not with the Cong.
If you knew, why didn't you say anything?
So why tell me now?
Sometimes. When it's convenient.
Never?
Pleasant dreams.
Just relax.
I don't believe this. It's a miracle, Michael. A miracle.
Well that's good to know.
Glorious. I'm not surprised. I fed you enough of that stuff to send a horse to heaven. I'm just glad you came back.
No. I couldn't.
I don't know what to say.
You come near me and I'll blow us all up.
Count 'em on one hand.
She said I haven't been the same since then. Since that night. There's still this big hole in my brain. It's so dark in there, Jake. And these creatures. It's like they're crawling out of my brain. What happened that night? Why won't they tell us?
No. No. It's okay. I'm okay.
Pour it in.
Speaking of which, duck!
Alright, asshole.
Then break it! If you don't pull it, the ship's going to depressurize!
If the ship goes, so does Jaso.
No.
Why wouldn't we be. I mean, look around. So far so good.
Sergeant? We thought you were...
Explosive. We're blowing the walkway.
Somebody's gonna have to go back to the engine room.
What?!
He came for me, I had to run!
I think I broke my arm.
They're back here.
We could convert fission transistors.
Brodski I'll talk slow so you can understand me. She's thawing. If we don't get her to the lab, she'll die, and that will be on your bald fucking head!
Don't go out there. You can't win. We need to get off this ship. That's all there is to it.
So, you thought you'd be cool. Go against your father's wishes? Yeah, that's grown up.
And what happend to ...?
That sounds like Rizzo having faith in some of that future shit.
I think so, why?
We wait. I need about fifteen. Call me if there are any changes. If she farts I want a full report.
She broke my fucking nose!
I'd want her statements before we reach porch. Jesus, women.
Oh I like her a lot.
Just go! I've a feeling he's right behind us!
Later.
Try to calm down. Just think, you're going to be famous!
Crutch?
Kay-em 14.
You need to get laid!
Are there any other shuttles?
Ow!
Who are you apologizing to?
A real mamma's boy that one. Dissed his mamma and he nearly threw a tantrum. Little good it did him.
Ssh.
What?!!
But?!!
We just left old Earth. You'll never believe what we found.
Alright, I'm . . .  No way . . . is this a joke?
See you then . . . doctor.
Get him out of there!
Why don't you get it? He's going to kill us all!
You wanna die?
Scientists. Very intellegent men.
4You're not going anywhere.
You're crazy!
What have I done?! Idiots.
Listen up duck fuckers, you can't kill this thing.
Sure, Dad.
Here --  Take him home.
Get behind me, dummy!  Reverse her and turn -- he's taking too much line!  Wet my reel, quick!
Unbuckle me -- fast!  Grab the leader. He ain't normal, this one... they never --
What do we do? Get some help? Radio in?
Where...?
He's taken him!
Do you see the kids?
I never hear the whistle.
Here? You gotta be kiddin'.
Ow.  He's gotta be more careful in the water...
Michael! Come inside!
Can you do that?
What'll I tell the kids?
I didn't agree to that!
Be reasonable, boys -- this isn't the time or the place to do some kind of half-assed autopsy on a fish. Ben...  do you have all the pictures you need?
Let's all get out of here, this place stinks.
What kind of a shark did you say it was?
I don't know if I can do that without a...
Maybe we can save August...
My kids were on that beach...
You're tellin' me. I swear, this town has gone crazy.
Who are you?
Let's all have a drink.
It's called Territoriality. It's a theory.
Depth-finder, fathometer, sonar, closed-circuit TV -- fore and aft -- RDF, single side band...  And two loose nuts behind the wheel.
Sometimes.  Look here -- something big, probably a school of mackerel clumped together. And staying right with us.
They must've hit something.
That means closing the beaches.
This is quite a place.
You were on the Indianapolis? In '45? Jesus...
Wednesday... No, it's Tuesday, I think.
Oh, no, sir. I've never had a woman do that. I'm sure she drowned.
No. Cambridge. Harvard. My family's in Tuxedo, New York, though.
A thousand apiece, something like that. There's five of us. And we each kick in a hundred a week for beer and cleaning, stuff like that.
It's only two-thirty. What, are you tired?
I saw a show with sea otters, and a big turtle... Mikey loved it. Made me promise to get him one. Will you live on the boat?
He's busy.
I just found out about it -- but there's a bunch of Boy Scouts in the water a coupla miles down the coast from where we found the girl. Avril Bay, thereabouts. Chief went to dry them off.
Just a little appetizer. I want our porker to know we're serving. I want to put some iron into that big yap...
Real fine stuff but it won't mean a thing to Mr. Whitey, of course... he didn't go to schools in electronics. He was born with what he does best. Eat. He's a swimming appetite. 'Course he might eat this stuff, but then I've seen him eat a rocking chair, too.  Next time, ask me.
Let it go, don't waste your time.
Look -- you may be a big Yahoo in the lab, but out here you're just supercargo, and you'll do as I say, or you can take your gear and backstroke home. Now get down here!
No -- comin' right at us! Slow ahead, he'll hit us head on --  Slower! Throttle back ---
Well, I'm not going to commit economic suicide on that flimsy evidence. We depend on the summer people for our lives, and if our beaches are closed, then we're all finished.
I don't think so.
I'm not hungry, oddly.
So that's cool with you, then?
I did the prep questions for this lab last night. You can copy my answers if you need to.
Yeah. Um, I hooked up a whole private adoption thing. These married people in Saint Cloud are going to be the parents.
The guy is super cool! His name is Mark and he's into old horror movies and he plays guitar. I actually hung out with him today.
Yeah. Sure. Once Tino gets a new drumhead we should be good to go.
Were we together?
Your mom must be really glad you're not taking me.
Also, I think I'm in love with you.
Basically, I'm completely smitten with you, and I don't care if I'm making an ass out of myself right now, because you've seen me make an ass out of myself a million times, and you still want to be my friend.
I don't really know anything about it.
Excuse me?
But I'm going to give it up for adoption. I already found the perfect people.
Well, you're a brave young lady. You're made of stronger stuff than I thought. You're a little Viking!
They said they wanted to know about this stuff. They said to keep them updated, so I did!
You don't know anything about me!
It's called a spinal block, and you can't have it yet, honey. The doctor said you're not dilated enough.
It really didn't hurt that bad having him.
Yes they are, Josh. Since Mankato, they have been lying eyes.
Fine. Call me when you learn how to love just one person and not cheat at your brother's college just because you had four Smirnoff Ices and a bottle of Snow Peak Peach flavored Boone's!
Technically, that would be kickin' it Old Testament.
I don't get a klepto vibe from you. Evil genius? Maybe. Arsonist? Wouldn't rule it out.
Wow, you get a whole room in your own house? She's got you on a long leash there, Mark.
You weren't even alive!
Commercials.
I wrote that.
I didn't. But it's a three-way tie between the Stooges, Patti Smith and the Runaways.
Oh yeah. It's Herschel Gordon Lewis. He's the ultimate master of horror.
Frankly, this looks kind of stupid.
Here's to dovetailing interests.
Well, sort of. Vanessa likes Madison for a girl.
I'll handle this. I'm really good at diffusing mom-type rage.
Why?
Consider it your musical education.
Most Fruitful Yuki is bad ass, man. You should be proud to be the same condition.
No?
What's the matter?
But you're old!
Yeah, but didn't you love Vanessa when you married her? If you love someone once, you can love them again, I know it. My friend Leah has gone out with the same guy, like, four times. You're just not trying.
God, you're so young.
No thanks. I'm off pills.
Vanessa, right?
Yeah, but I hardly noticed it. I'm more worried about the part where I have to start wearing jeans with an elastic panel in the front.
Can I use the facilities first? Being pregnant makes you pee like Seabiscuit.
So, then, you really think you're going to go ahead with this?
This is the baby. Your baby.
What do you mean? You mean...  Do you think I'm going to flake out on you?
Naah. I'm already pregnant, so they figure nothing worse could happen to me. I gotta bounce anyway. It was nice seeing you guys again.
Your name, please?
Congrats.
The baby? I don't know anything about it yet. I only know it's got fingernails, allegedly.
Paulie Bleeker? I didn't know he had it in him!
Once! And she didn't die, if you recall!
I have no idea what kind of girl I am.
No, but you know Bren. She dreams big.
Think you can narrow it down for me.
Are you having boy trouble? I gotta be honest; I don't much approve of you dating in your condition, 'cause... well, that's kind of messed up.
Either I just pissed my pants or...
I think the last one was defective. The plus sign looked more like a division sign.
That is sick, man.
I couldn't do it, Leah! It smelled like a dentist in there. They had these really horrible magazines, with, like, spritz cookie recipes and bad fiction and water stains, like someone read them in the tub. And the receptionist tried to give me these weird condoms that looked like grape suckers, and she told me about her boyfriend's pie balls, and Su-Chin Kuah was there, and she told me the baby had fingernails. Fingernails!
Bleeker and I were going to go to Gettysburg for spring break.
There are ads? For parents?
I'm pregnant.
No way. No, I definitely don't want to know.
Or stage parents!
Share the love, Tits!
You sound shocked or something.
Yeah, well, Bleek trusted me. We're best friends.
I'm not jealous, and I don't care. I just know he doesn't like Katrina and I don't think he should toy with her emotions like that. She seems so nice and all.
Prom is for wenises, anyway. Once you're old enough to go, it's not cool anymore.
Oh no. Thank you. Come on in.
Vanessa has wanted a baby since we got married.
Hm.
I don't know. There's just things I still want to do.
I suppose anything's possible.
Not really.
Early Grayce if this ain't your lucky day.
I haven't... I'm a fast learner.
What's Early been in jail for?
That's not true!
Almost.
They ain't dangerous Adele. They're writers.
Go back to the car and keep Brian there. I don't want him in here...  Do it Adele... Now!
Thank you for what?  What are you thanking me for Adele?
She had a dream that somethin' like this was gonna happen.
Walter Livesy.
Vernon, Florida.
Turkey mostly.
Best kind.
How much do I owe you?
It's just a work in progress, kinda rough.
Who?
Henry Lee Lucas. Well he was only convicted of killing eleven but he claimed to have killed over three hundred.
Dahlia, no.
Yeah.
Ain't you goin' to record it?
No, it's all yours. It's on me... for saving my ass back there.
If you say so.
Two brothers, prospectors, lived here. Up until a few years back.
Thank god!
The party?
...I do.
...I think it's the best stuff I've done.
I still think we should have met them first.
Hey, I got some great stuff... it's okay.
Fuck!
I'm finished.
Oh come on, don't give me that shit... you wanted to take these photos as much as I wanted you too.
Oh, I don't know... I think that once I dye my hair blonde, buy a string bikini and cultivate that tan... I could be veggin' out with the best of 'em...  Like fer shurr!
No, never. Excuse me.
You sick twisted fuck! You don't know shit about me.
...I know I'd love to smash this bottle right in your fucking face.
Who are you?
Without his car?
No, but I can tell you he's not gonna be too happy about this.
Yes!
You fucked it?
Hell yeah. That bitch was bleeding. When I first put it in she screamed real loud. I saw her bite down on the pillow.
Hell's yeah. She was so clean.
You could tell she took care of herself. She had all these powders and creams in her bathroom.
Right.
She's probably smash you in the fucking face.
Yeah, I feel dehydrated.
Unzip my pack, yo.
Yep.
Yeah me too nigga.
He looks like my uncle.
Oh. You like her?
Yeah. She's only 13.
Yeah.
Bet.
I guess so. I gotta stop off home too.
You are?
Why not? You stink.
Na.
I don't know. But all I know is that I kicked him so many times my fuckin' toe feels broken.
Yeah. Do it again.
Nuffin' G. Just forget it.
Come on bitch. Throw your fists up.
Tonight?
Trust me. Don't be nervous.
Why is that?
I don't feel so well. Have you seen Telly anywhere?
What?
But I only had sex with Telly.
Oh it's OK. That's life. Maybe tomorrow I'll win lotto. Who knows? You don't. No one does.
No.
Mine?
Yeah?
I'm not sure. He said something about meeting Darcy. I think he likes her now.
Because he can like climax you up to that...
Have you ever swallowed it before?
Right. You know it's not like... You know there's a difference between sex, making love, and fucking!
Yeah.
Yeah. It depends. Cause like this one time with Eric, when we got blasted at his house. And Smash J and DJ Flipper was there...
But then the sex gets into the way and you're like: What happened! What the hell happened?!
Yeah. Fifteen minutes to a half an hour. Hard and deep.
He still does.
Four-thirty in the morning?
Paul it's Telly. Open up.
Yep.
And we were like underneath the sheets. We were going at it like crazy. Oh my God that shit was so good! It was like hard...
Yo, let me get in your parent's room man. Just fir a little while.
You like to play games, don't you, Peter?
His victims aren't random.  It only means that they appear to be random. There's a connection, we just have to find it.
Let's see how much he wants to play.
How'd you get in here?
I used to.  With my old man.  He taught me how to hunt and trap.  Trapping's a lot harder than most people think.  We used to go after Raccoons mostly. They'd get into our garbage, our fields.  When an animal can't live peacefully with those around it, it has to be destroyed.  But they're crafty little devils.  You see the trick is, you can put your trap down, but no Raccoon is going come near it unless you lay down the scent.  You ever smell Raccoon scent?  Smells like shit, but to a male Raccoon it smells just like pussy.  He'll walk right up to that trap, even though it don't look nothing like a Raccoon and stick his Goddam head right in it.  You know why?  Cause he can't help himself.  The scent drives him.  So, if you want to catch a Raccoon all you gotta do is figure out where he is -- lay down the scent -- and sooner or later he'll walk right into the trap.
Well then, you just gotta find out where he is -- and once you're sure where he is -- you shoot the fucker.
No, I need the original note.
Sit down!
He's got an answer for everything, but he doesn't have an alibi.
What was your relationship with her?
It's a voice modulator.
You weren't mad at him for picking up the phone?
Did anyone look suspicious?  Think!
But a hundred men could move him.
You couldn't find your dick in a wind storm!
Do you know what I'm doing right now, Peter?  I'm looking at the name of the girl I'm going to kill tonight.
Because she's the type.
Why are you doing this?  You must have some idea of the pain you're causing people.
If it's so important, why don't you just tell me?
The police haven't told you?
No!  Wait!!
You told me.  When you called you said she was in the other room.  Drop the knife.
Thanks.
Set up some pieces on the big board?
Never mind.  He died two years ago.
He already did once.
Not really.  It's pretty boring.
Nice meeting you.
My cheering section.
Not much.  There's no sign of a break in.  I think she let him in.
No prints.
Well, the fact that he views this as a game suggests that he is trying to prove some sense of superiority -- and the way he murders confirms a need to be in complete control of his victim.
I know that.  I've seen the photo's.
You know, I hate to say I told you so, but I warned her.  Coming home at all hours of the night.  A young girl new to the city.  This neighborhood ain't what it used to be.
She called to give me my schedule for tomorrow.
I don't know.  I was afraid there'd be hours of questions.  I can't afford to miss a game.
"Wee Willie Winkie runs though the street."  We think he might be making a reference to himself.
It doesn't make sense.
How can he be playing Chess with you? You're not making any moves against him.
But he had to dump the body there to make the move.
Chess is a reflection of life.  Life is violent.  The strong win.  The weak perish.
Each circumstance requires a different tactic.
Getting too hot in here for you?
Nothing.  I just came in for a steam.
I don't think I could.
You sound like my mother.
You're not?
No.  But I'm open to distractions.
I dunno.  Where's Erica mother?
It must've been very hard on Erica?
Would you settle for pepperoni?
Because to follow the game he played he had to move to that grid?
I'm not looking for an apology, Peter.
I can't think any more, unless it's about you.  I'll be in the middle of a match and instead of thinking about my next move, I think about how you look when you smile.  Remember how you said that I hide behind my chessboard?  Ever since my wife died I've been...  I've been afraid of getting too close to someone again -- afraid of losing them.
It's not that easy.
You're getting sloppy, Yurilivich. You're nervous?
Well, you should be, because this time I'm going to win.
Well, you're beautiful.
We're not married <u>yet</u>.
Maybe you'd better look around for another candidate. I don't think my skin is tough enough to survive a lifetime of you and your brush.
Colwyn.
No. They watch me closely, but they haven't harmed me.
In a great fortress in the mountains. Wait. Something's happening.
Colwyn ...
You must move away from the Center.
You have rope?
You won't have to.
Reach out farther. Call to her.
She was in a great fortress, first in the mountains, then in the jungle. How is that possible?
Then even if Lyssa tells us where she is, we'll never be able to reach her, for they will never allow the Fortress to rise near us.
What do you see?
She is too deep. The curved tunnel we saw is part of the Vortex, the place of The Beast.
He has come for Lyssa.
No. She must agree of her own free will.
You are young. You don't understand the attraction of great power, and you forget the pain of long waiting.
Lyssa, your bracelets. Bend them straight and cross them.
Where the spiral begins.
Cut. <u>Cut</u>!
No! You cannot know that!
We must enter the swamp.
You will not, then?
What business?
I was hoping I might be your friend.
To the place where Death lives.
They do not exist, except in the waters of the Swamp, where they will remain.
Yes, my lord.
At the gallop!
The Swamp of Betrayal. Be glad we don't have to cross it.
No.
I'd wish for a puppy.
I only want one.
The greatest boon of your otherwise worthless life, blockhead, is the privilege of dining on boar roasted by the hand of Ergo the Magnificent.
The one with red eyes was a Dark One, the other was a Cyclops, and it was not you he meant to kill.
If that were so, you'd be dead now. He was aiming at the Dark One, for there is ancient hatred between them. Once his race had two eyes, like other men, until his forefathers bargained with the Dark Ones: they gave up one of their eyes in return for the power to see the future. But they were cheated, for the only future they were permitted to see was the time of their own death.
And who is <u>he</u> that they should join <u>him</u>?
Well, at least I'm glad to see you have a sense of humor. That's the first smile I've seen on that gloomy face of your's ...  ... isn't it? It isn't. Oh no. Oh dear. Oh now I've gone and done it.
Then he will die!
We will have to try again. His knowledge is great. Without it, we cannot hope to win.
With an old voice?
There's an Emerald Circle a few leagues from here.  We'll find her.
The Widow of the Web?
She has the power to kill.
It's a hundred leagues from here.
It is not necessary. They will not follow.
No, she was not as beautiful.
You said nothing. You told me nothing.
Where is he? My son.
Yes.
Of what?
Why must you know?
You cannot stop time. Go now, before it runs out.
Huh? I see, but this is the FBI, little girl, and I can't let you in.  But if you leave me his money, I'll give him it myself.
No... I can't... I got tired. I want to live my way.
Yeah.
Dirty work, and I kill no women and no kids.
Listen, think about what you want to do, but don't worry, your money is there and it's safer than in a bank... Banks are robbed every five minutes!
What if you can't approach the car or he changes car?
Oh really?  But can you miss the car?
Yes.
Mathilda, stop, please!
...17.
...Later.
Huh, really? What? Come on, I'm waiting!
...Yes.
Nothing, for the moment.
Good! Snipers can't be in position.
Let me work. We'll get out, I tell you!
Not at all, Mathilda! I tell you because it's true! You'll buy the globe you told me about and you will choose, OK? We'll go where you want! I swear, you'll see, Mathilda!!
...I got lost, Mister.
Huh, that's good!
...And how much is it?
Yeah... And still in Messina.  He's my uncle.
You're right, son. You must care the links with your family, always.  It's the only important thing in the world.
Why am I such an authority?
If you can't redo these six hundred miles when you're rested and ready, how are you possible going to walk another two thousand-five hundred miles in your present condition?
What?
I think my uncle is suffering from a condition called Mania which is linked with depression.  It is a time when an individual will act over-confident, and will act out impractical, grandiose plans. Sometimes these plans can be dangerous.
Are you and your friends planning on driving soon?
No, I just don't want anybody dying because I didn't say something when I had the chance.
That's enough.
I'll kill you!
Pardon?
I'm going to ask you a question that may sound peculiar.
You have?
Okay.
You're talking to me?
You like to take walks?
Please not, 'The two kinds of people' speech.
He's plastered.
When I was ten, my family lived in Pacifica for a year.  I used to go to the beach everyday that summer. I never felt so happy, carefree. It was a magic place for me... That's where my heaven will be.
Yes.
Do you believe a person's soul lives on after their death?
About my love for her.
Not our problem.
Maurice and Ellen Parker... it was issued in Philly... Mr. Maurice Parker has come a long way from home.  Why?
You tell stories?
Mammoth.
I always knew you had good instincts...  Goodbye Kris.  I'll see you when I get back.
I told you.
Pacifica, California -- it's a coastal city.
She knew you loved her.
So I've been informed.
Saluting.
Which hospital?  Did you take me back?
Steph.
I need your help.
You should.  Children are a blessing from God.  I have four.
He's getting my sweater from the car.  I said there was a breeze.  I told him not to go.
Yes.
Confused.  I'm not sure what to do now.  I'm not sure what he wants for me.
What do you mean?
Evening News?
This isn't right.
What do you think I should get?
...Noooo.
No.
No.
Water?
You what?
Of course.
Maybe another drink first. More tequila?
No, just drunk... but that's OK. Where's your car?
Are you serious.
No, I can't have dinner with you.
Well, then I guess this is our first date... or our last. Until now, I wasn't sure it was either.
What are you thinking? Are you angry with me?
I'm going to move to a smart hotel, tomorrow if it'll make you feel better.  Let's talk about tomorrow. Wanna do something?
There's no reason to blow all your money on a hotel room.
So... I'm not too concerned with long term plans.
Don't be silly?
What?
Why don't you go in and sit down. I have some gifts for you.
Sorry.
Because... it's better for me that way. OK?
I expect some kind of loyalty here. Just because I fuck for money doesn't give you cause to start picking up women and leaving me looking silly.
Very well... umm... I never expected to have to ask you this again... but how did our evening go? I remember getting to the casino... I remember kissing you... that was really nice but everything after that is a blank.
I warned you...  ...but I'm sorry.
That's amazing. What are you? Some sort of angel visiting me from one of my drunk fantasies? How can you be so good?
Yes... I'll give you that.
You be careful to. I'm going to miss you.
I didn't know I'd ever need it again.
Oh, Ben... you look so very sick... my love... you're so pale.
Suits. I didn't tell them anything. You know anything about gears?
Yes, that would be great. Are you her for the convention?
I want this, Sera. I need this!
I am lonely, Yuri.
Where have you been staying?
Yuri... are you...
I once had to judge a Theta Chi Tighty- Whitey contest. Trust me -- I can handle anything.
Get up.
He's an ass that's gonna try.
You took my class in LA. You had the best high kick I've ever seen. Are you one of my lawyers?
I'm a fraud! But it's not like normal people can have this ass! If my fans knew, I'd lose everything. I've already lost my husband. I rather be in jail then lose my reputation!
Did she have a weapon in her hand?
Because they got wet.
Due to the fact that you retained the residence, Ms. Bonafante is entitled to full ownership of the canine property in question and we will be enforcing said ownership immediately.
He's gay -- he isn't Brooke's lover! He's making it up. Whoever killed Heyworth is paying him off.
I'm impressed that you took the initiative to go there and get it. That's what makes a good lawyer. And on top of that, you gained the client's trust and kept it. That's what makes a great lawyer. You're smart, Elle. Smarter than most of the guys I have on my payroll.
No!
No.
Relation?
Too bad you and I are the only ones.
I think you should go with red. It's the color of confidence.
The professors? Yeah, they tend to do that. Socratic method.
Speak up in Donovan's class. He likes people with an opinion. Sit in the back for Royalton. He tends to spit when he talks about products liability.
Wow. I'm glad I met you.
My money's on the angry daughter or the ex-wife.
She's completely untrustworthy.
And D) Brooke is obviously hiding something.
But maybe it is --
How do you figure?
No, she can't move for an hour.
Did your daughter ever say anything to you about Brooke and Heyworth's relationship?
Blondes are discriminated against worldwide! Brooke's a blonde, and people are saying she's sleeping with the cheesy pool boy and shooting her husband. If she was a mousy brunette, it would be, "Oh, the poor widow."
It would be a full-service law firm, by and for blondes, providing positive blonde role models and community outreach in high blonde areas. I mean, think about it -- name one blonde intellectual role model.
That is a direct result of anti- blonde discrimination!
What?!
Are you asking me on a date?
Why not?
You're applying for my internship, aren't you?
You should. Do you have a resume?
She could make you drop three pounds in one class. She's completely gifted!
Your what?
My family expects a lot from me. And I expect a lot from me. I plan on running for office some day.
I'm seriously in love with you -- Isn't that enough?
Sarah was my girlfriend at prep school. We got back together over the summer at my grandmother's birthday party.
I gave her my word, Warner.
See?
I'm covered in very expensive Egyptian mud -- hardly naked.
Well, that's what we're trying to prove didn't happen. Do you have any reason to believe it did?
I didn't stick around long enough to watch him stick his swizzle stick in her mouth, but I'd bet my next check that that's where he was about to put it.
It's not a Theta --
Helloo... you let him have anal sex with you.  Helloo... you let him videotape you diddling yourself.
Pull up next to him!
Faith.
Precisely.  Faith has persuaded them a pygmie with a sling can kill an armed giant.
Then we smash 'em?
Nay.  This is a private affair, no audience welcome... Better you watch the dismantling of our enemies... and, look you, see the moat is set aflame.
Always.
No.  Smashing is not required.  I have a surprise for our tiny invaders... Raise that hatch!
Your words sting more sharply than your whip.
You are cruel!  Your heartless jesting worse than torture!  How can you speak of love when you see what I am!
You lie!  You wish to humiliate me, as if the form I'm forced to bear were not punishment enough!
Not from me, surely...
What do you want from me?
What will become of me then?
And, now?
Oh, no, never... nothing like that... never crossed my mind.
Then you'll understand my quest.  An ogre named Blackheart has killed the last stag unicorn and stolen his horn.  The world outside is cursed, plunged into eternal winter.  Unless I return the alicorn, the earth will be frozen forever.
It's terrible.
Oh no... Don't you understand?
We be honored, friend Ogg.
Dance, Jack!  The night's but begun.
Twas the Princess Lili gave me the answer... have you seen her, by chance?
Please don't misunderstand.  I am grateful for your hospitality and --
If you're looking for enchantment, Jack, that I can give thee...
Then, what's gone wrong?  Why did it happen?
And if she thinks me a liar?
Bravely spoke.  You've the heart of a champion, true enough.
Now, Jack-lad, no one's asking ye to skewer the worm.  Even St. Michael'd have a job on his hands for all that.  But the serpent hoards a pile of booty, Achilles' armor among his treasures... if we find our way within the mound and him asleep...
You do the praying.  I've work ahead.
Better we eat him than the other way round.
Something's coming.
It would appear so.
Blackheart?
Jack, Jack, it's dwarves live here. Hard-working chaps.  Hammering in the forge all the live-long day. Make the most wondrous things, they do.
Very secretive, they are.  Keep their feet covered up.  Best if you don't mention it.
Willful creature, that one...
We'll find it.
But seem to have gotten lost on the way.
It feels wrong, Jack... like a trap.
And frog don't fly and bite like tomcats.  It be magic, Jack... powerful ogre's magic.
That's it!
Can you save her?
Sunlight, you say?
Mean you to seek him out below?
Did you bring me here to sup?
Listen to him.  Not in the mood...
I'm not denying it's a joyous day --
Wolf-slayer, worm-sticker... give a cheer for the champion!
No, no, no... this is different!
Very thrifty.  Even got your arrow back.
Nay, Sire, I'll cling to it as to life itself...
Sorry.
I may have said perhaps...
Or perchance...
Sport, indeed.
All right.  I'll show you something sacred.
Only were he a fool to boot.  See yon viper?
Be patient.
They rival the angels of paradise.
Tis a fair question.  If you be a virtuous maid the unicorn will lay his head in your lap.
Not if you be chaste.  Tis an awesome test of virginity.
I'm not your judge... nor have I any desire to witness the trial.
I don't know.  They've hurt the unicorn.
I don't want to be reminded of what happened.
Let it.  Haven't you a cozy bower we might hide in?
Then, perchance you'll me.
Do you wish it, Jack?  Wish you this our wedding band?
I was bewitched... it's better this way...
No... it's not you he's afraid of, it's... light...
That's why he goes masked during the day...
In the dark... where I join him...
I can't have been under much more than a minute.
But... I am a Green Man.  I have no title, nor lands... scarce even a few vines and threads to keep the cold from my body.
Ouch!  Something's biting me.
Pinching me!
Everywhere!  Ow!
Grand champion, is it?  And what great cause leads you to me?
Aye.  And it is the trouble befallen us that brings me here.  I entreat you to tell me the cause of our surrounding sorrow, most lovely of the lovely.
Come sit beside me, sweet boy, and I'll draw you a map.
Ask away, sweet man.
Is she fair, this princess?
Far as you're concerned she's dead, believe it or not.
What shape I take matters not.  Long you for another?  I'll give you your heart's desire.
You... you... you mortal you!
And as barren of love as stone.
We wait.
Watch behind or I'll never collect on it!
Up ahead!
His honor, I suppose... seeing he no longer can defend it.
Bah!  You faeries have the morals of ferrets.
Oh, but I have.
I slew the Lindfarne Worm with it.
May God protect you.
That very nice.
You follow.
You've been inside?
We did a lot of the wiring too.
Since seventh grade.
Mom said I should.
Who are all these people?
No.
Monday.
I'm not shaving my legs or pits this summer, I've decided.
I need to ask you something, Mr. Nelson.
I want you to try something with me, okay?
Maybe your tongue...I don't know, my mouth is numb.  Why did you do that?
What did you think it would be?
What are you doing here?
I don't know.
He jumped into the ocean.
Come over to my house whenever you want. I'll tell my mom.
I'll get your back.
Really?
His parents took his car.  They're making him ride a bicycle the rest of the summer.
I don't even...what do you mean?  I don't even know what that means.
Hand me a towel.  Hand me a towel.
What?
I guess I'd just be jealous if I were him.
After your last extension request and with Design Review and the Board of Adjustment and the appeals to the city council, was there an amended permit?
What are you on?
It may sound that way, but I react out of fear.  My life has nothing to do with what I like or don't like.  You haven't been listening, have you?
She's out with a friend.
Uh huh.
I don't know.
You'll know me by the time we're through.
If you hit me, I'll call the police.
Goodnight.
I warned you yesterday.
No.
You snore at night.  That bugs me.  Can I take you out?
I'm gonna take a walk.  I need some money.
What I'm not.
Getting high, I guess.
I haven't used anything for two days. I'm trying.
Yes.
Well, congratulations!  You fucking pulled it off!
Good for you.
We just weren't very much alike, I guess. I don't know.  I liked your dad more than I liked you.
Do you know what I'd give to have this! Forget how I got it!  I can't afford dirt in this town.  I live in Riverside, Goddammitt  And you get to piss in the ocean.
I know there's an explanation.
I don't let him.  He just loves to.
Where is he?
I can't leave the house?
We have it on video!  Was that when?  My parents were down for his sixth birthday! I remember that.
I think so.
This was my very first slow dance.
Oh, I'm worse.  Much, much worse.
I can hire workers to help me.
Going on?
I'm an idiot to have you up there.
You got any weed?
Should I?
What would you be if you asked Adam and Ryan to run in now and hug you?
Sooner than the Fall.
Hey.
No.
Okay.
I didn't go in your room.
I don't know what I'm doing.
Can we really help build a house?
Nigger.
There are ways around that. Right sergeant?
But you can't.
Well, alright then. What do you think about this new tie?
Over forty years now. Me and Ray Gibson out there.
Yes, sir.
He's right, Gibson. Put down the gun and we'll work this out.
I was hoping you were gonna say an engagement ring, Claude.
He seemed like a pretty good lawyer to me. His offices take up an entire floor of that big, new building on 125th Street, and he was using all these words I never heard before. He even offered me a job.
That's because I've never been here before.
Well, if you must know, bank teller at First Federal of Manhattan. I'm responsible for keeping track of hundreds, occasionally thousands of dollars.
Damn straight, it is. I got my own set of keys because I'm supposed to open up. So if I ain't there 8 a.m. Monday morning, there's gonna be hell to pay.
I don't know. Bank teller. Sounds like ladies work to me.
You gave up baseball to be a bank teller? I can't latch on to that.
You're talking about giving up baseball to be a bank teller.
That thing? Who'd you steal it from?
Hey, man, don't ever call me that.
Yeah, I want some pie.
What gave you that idea?
Still got that ten dollars?
While you were upstairs doing God's work, I was getting jack-legged by a fool with four threes.
My daddy's watch. This is the dude I was telling you about --
Spanky's gonna be pissed? Poor Spanky. Fuck Spanky! What the hell kind of a name is Spanky, anyway? You're responsible for this situation. I blame you for everything. If it wasn't for you, I'd be home having a hot meal right now.
Shut up. It's too damn hot. What do you know, anyway?
What about you, Radio?
Wait up there, Claude. You give that guy your corn bread and the next thing you know you'll be ironing his shirts and clipping his toenails.
So?
Forget it.
On your behalf. What happened to we?
You know what, Claude? This whole time we've been down here, you've done nothing but think about yourself, acting like this whole thing is my fault. That plan with your cousin, did that include me?
Cookie didn't draw it. I did.
How the fuck are we gonna do that, Ray?!
What am I gonna eat?
Hey, man, is Babe Ruth in the lineup today?
I'm not gonna let it go. The man needs to explain himself. Makin' promises.
They're called pilots! I'm serious, Ray. I'm not in the mood for one of your stupid, fucked-up plans right now.
The only thing I regret is the day I met you.
I didn't do if for you, anyway. I just ain't no boot-licking trusty, that's all.
That was five years ago.
You sure looked funny running for those pies, bullets flying all around you.
What the hell are you doing in that trunk?!
I ain't escaping! We're picking up the new super just like I told you.
I said you're soft.
An erection, huh? Haven't had one of those in a while.
Never thought I'd hear Ray Gibson say that. Hell with you then. You'd only slow me down anyway.
Well, if you must know, they could be closer.
I'm all right.
'Preciate it. Claude.
You killed Santa Claus?
Why ain't that pick swinging?
New York. That's up north, ain't it? They'll find we do things different down here.
Move it out.
My corn bread? Oh no, my friend. I love corn bread.
Hey, Ray...
I think that old man lost his marbles about a hundred years ago. Come on, let's get this over with.
It'll be too late.
I prefer bourbon.
If somebody deserves respect, Mr. Pike, they receive it from me, convict or no convict.
What difference does it make? Natchez was better off without Winston Hancock! Who cares if a couple of no- account bootleggers went to jail for his killing? At least the state of Mississippi got 40 years of cheap labor out of the deal!
Sure don't. Mind if I ask where you got it?
Jenny?
They're called subways. A nickel will take you from one end of Manhattan to the other. Helluva ride, too.
You mean the Boom-Boom Room?
Green's the only color that matters under the hill. They got gambling, girls. You oughta check it out.
But you do. What does that say about you, Ray? What does that say about me? I've given you a lot of leeway over the years on account of your father. But he didn't last long enough to teach you the meaning of the word respect so I guess I'm gonna have to school you myself.
He's sick?
Let her go.
Yeah, get out of here! Beat it!
Brilliant. This is so much fun. I never want it to end.
I was going to let you out, eventually, Cassius. I swear.
Urr... uggg... errr...
Maybe try the opposite of that.
I'm not a hundred percent on that. God said when the time comes, you'll know what to do.
He'll be here. Just keep your cool, kid.
I can't screw.  I can't screw.
That turn you on there, RuPaul?
Come on, there's like ten million people in this city and the clock is ticking.
Nobody's as evil as my brothers. Those dudes put the wick in wicked.
Maybe you love her. But what do I know? I'm baked out of my mind.
Everything's fine, pop.
This is bullshit, man.  I'm gonna win the Superbowl this year, with or without you!
Oh, and don't forget, you're shoving a pineapple up Hitler's ass at four o'clock.
Put it back on my head. I'm falling apart here.
Don't worry about coming up with anything. It's cool.
Well, I thought that after messing with your head, I'd give you a little kick in the keester.
So go get 'em, Dad!
Well, I guess I'm going to have to take a mulligan on this one.
I will, Dad. But in the words of Motley Crue, this will always be my... home sweet home...
Coulda been much worse.
I know, your wickedness.
It's Stanley, sir.
I gotta say this cake tastes a little funny.
Oh, would you grow up.
Gotta be one of his disciples or something.
We know where to find Nicky.
Can't Beefy use his penis powers to get us out of this?
Absolutely nothing. The Blizzard always came straight with his messages. But wrap your minds around this one.
Whoa, that chick must be the real deal, then. Later on.
Oh, that's terrible, Reege...
Dude, it's us. Let us in.
I'm sorry. I just assumed. Your accent maybe. Where are you from?
"Octopus people?"
No, for you! How old are you, Billy?
You walked in. I saw you. Don't you remember?
Where do you send them?
Do you know how long all this will last? Not thirty years... or thirty thousand years... but thirty thousand years... and you'll be part of it. Ages will roll... Ages. And you'll be here... the two of you... eternally frozen... frozen... beautiful.
Let me sculpt you and I will show you where the others have gone.
Open your eyes once, idiot.  It's not every day that a Sandman son is born. I'm telling you, Francis -- that's him!
Yes.  But you look a little rusty to me -- what were you doing, wondering?
...and he was hunting the first one, this one. Wasn't he? Wasn't he? This one was running, the other one was hunting him...
Please... No.
No.  Just no.
A friend of mine went on Carousel tonight. Now he's gone.
Then it's still no.
Both... running's what I'm interested in.
A Runner gave it to me.
Maybe you'll think of something...
Maybe they're angry because they're grown in meccano-breeders.
That's nothing... there's a Sandman behind us, too and there'll be more soon. Take me to them.
Yes.  I don't know what else to do -- with him following us.  Why do you keep running from your --
We'll convince them.
It's brighter there... besides, we can't go back.
I guess so... I know I felt something I never felt before... and I didn't like it... not a bit.  I'll tell you one thing... Sanctuary better be worth it. That's the last place for me to live now.
Why don't we rest here? We know we can eat these.
Yes. You and I, Jessica. 
Of course.  I don't know where...  I just took them for granted.  It's our only chance.
But there are so many of them. Do you know each one separately.
All this. All of it.
Hello.
A Sandman can get as sick of his face as anyone else. Where's the doctor?
For as long as I can remember.
Gracious... no.
I'm sorry but I don't have anything to give you.
What a pity. I was hoping you'd be here to bury me.
More... many more.
I don't think so.
No, I'm okay.
Yeah.
Sure, I'm okay.
This is our bedroom.
What do you mean by that?
I forgot. Anyway, I hate the idea of acting paranoid.
No. Fred hates them.
Maid? Relative?
I don't know if I want to stay here. I don't feel safe.
Right... This just glided along.
Yeah... Laurent.
Are you positive he knows?
Okay.
Alice?
Alice?
Yes, I believe so.
Feeling good, Arnie. Ready to get to work.
The night before you showed up in the slammer...
Do ya good.
Sit down.
I gotta headache... What's goin' on?
No.
Out in back.
He's in the infirmary, being examined.
He... He can't talk. it appears as if he can't talk, anyway.
What's the word on the street?
We'll get a tail put on him.
I'm not entirely certain, Captain. You'll have to see for yourself.
You say you haven't seen your son since the day before yesterday?
What about yesterday?
Yes, and we need to talk to him... if we can.  Mel, let's get Peter in here.
Coming up.
He won't give his name.
FUCKIN' "A".
I like to laugh, Fred.
A videotape.
I don't know... There's no return address on the envelope... In fact, there's no address on it.
Huh?... oh, yeah, it is.
What night?
Called? When?
Yeah?
I guess so.
Thanks, guys.
But that doesn't solve the problem. Who is doing this? And why?
But...
Thanks, Mr. Eddy... whatiya need? Just the regular tune-up?
Fifteen car lengths. About two hundred and seventy feet.
No... Thank you!... I'll be bringin' the "Caddy" by tomorrow.
Yeah... How ya doin', Pete?
Yeah?...
Sure.
Sure. Sure I do.
No... I really don't want to talk about it.
You fuck me whenever you want... You don't call... Tell me who she is.
What's the BITCH'S name?!
It's always been a source of deep regret, but the mountains surrounding us have made reception almost impossible.
Yes. Those are our own people. They never venture beyond the point where you were met this morning. It is much too hazardous.
Yes.
I'm a paleontologist.
This is the only thing I was able to save when those heathens surrounded me.
Sir Henry Derwent was knighted, and he never got beyond the mesozoic era.
Well, it's a good morning, anyway.
Why, of course. Yes.
Oh, really?
Do you suppose we stopped someplace during the night and changed pilots?
All right, all right. Keep quiet.
Ha, ha - who are you to be talking about a mask? What do you mean? You've been wearing a mask ever since we met you.
Sounds like a stall to me.
And be poisoned out here in the open?
Plumbing. Everything modern. I'm going to run pipes all through the village—
Nothing. Why?
Oh, no - you don't want to go yet, honey.  She'll stick around too.  Is that right?
He must have had a heart attack, or perhaps the fumes. When the plane landed he was dead.
So there are others?
Who, for instance?
Shall we go inside? I should so like to show you some of our rare treasures.
A Belgian priest by the name of Father Perrault, the first European to find this place, and a very great man indeed. He is responsible for everything you see here. He built Shangri-La, taught our natives, and began our collection of art. In fact, Shangri-La is Father Perrault.
Why not? She's an attractive young woman.
I don't need any advice from you! Get me a doctor!
Well, we've been expecting this particular shipment for the past two years.
Yes.
How can we get in touch with them?
Don't believe him, Bob. He's just trying to get out.
Father Perrault is dead.
Aren't you afraid to leave? You don't want to look like an old woman, do you?
Personally, I've enjoyed your community very much. But my friends do not care for this mystery. They are determined to leave as soon as—
But to be candid, Father, a prolonged future doesn't excite me. It would have to have a point. I've sometimes doubted whether life itself has any. And if that is so, then long life must be even more pointless. No, I'd need a much more definite reason for going on and on.
I knew you'd understand. That's why I came to you for help.
Aha - very good, Freshie.[3] Very good. You'd better put his name on the list and make out a report later.
Yes.
The bloke up there looks a Chinese, or a Mongolian, or something.
What are you talking about?
You're a strange bird. No wonder Gainsford calls you the man who always wanted to see what was on the other side of the hill.
What's on your mind, Bob? You talk as though we're going to have trouble getting out of here.
There must be some connection between the plane and this place. They must have deliberately brought us here. Why, Bob? What reason could they have for doing a thing like that?
Good heavens, Bob, we've been here two weeks and we haven't found out a thing.
George. George - do you mind? I'm sorry, but I can't talk about it tonight.
I don't see that there's anything to say.
You can't leave, George.
I'm tired of owing you things. You're free to go. Go ahead.
Oh, George . . .
George, I may be wrong, I may be a maniac. But I believe in this, and I'm not going to lose it.  You know how much I want to help you, but this is bigger, stronger if you like than brotherly love. I'm sorry, George. I'm staying.
Yes, the little Russian girl.
I'm Alexander P. Lovett, sir.
Of course. We never left the air. I know - I didn't sleep the whole night long.
Brilliant!  Can anyone here fly a plane?
We'd be eternally grateful if you—
Oh, I know. It was full of this and full of that. But you were accomplishing nothing. You were going nowhere, and you knew it.
Don't worry about the pigeons. From now on, you can put flutes on my tail and bells on my feet!
All of it. Father Perrault and his magnificent history. This place, hidden away from the rest of the world, with its glorious concepts, and now you come along and confuse me entirely.
On the contrary, you're not strange. And that in itself is confusing. I have the same idea about Shangri- La. The sense that I've been here before, that I belong here.
Then it wouldn't be a garden spot for long.
Bump?
Forgiven.  You know, when we were on that plane, I was fascinated by the way its shadow followed it. That silly shadow racing along over mountains and valleys, covering ten times the distance of the plane. It was always there to greet us with outstretched arms when we landed. And I've been thinking that somehow you're that plane, and I'm that silly shadow. That all my life I've been rushing up and down hills, leaping rivers, crashing over obstacles, never dreaming that one day that beautiful thing in flight would land on this earth and into my arms.
I don't know. I'm a paleontologist, not a Foreign Secretary.
English!
We didn't get much information out of him, did we Bob?
Go? Where?
Well - no - I think I'd better wait. Yes, yes. I will. I'll wait.
I'm sorry.  I haven't even got any cigarettes left!
You'll tell me some of the things I want to know, won't you?  You'll tell me who runs this place. And why we were kidnapped. And what they're going to do with us!
It's not even a fucking door.
Your supervisors have no idea why you're here.
For instance...  It says here you lost your parents at 15, and, since then...
Yes, sir.
All the time, sir.
I'd go with number three.
Yup.  Sure is.
Why?  What are you gonna do?
What?
She didn't even know you. .
Just so I understand... you're "thing" is... acting like an idiot?  Or is it actually being an idiot?  Besides--
Let's see... that was second gear..Kay shifts into THIRD.  Jay winces.
I dunno. Why did that family need all their luggage for a dinner?.
Where to?
Get back in the car!
Since as long as we've been keeping records...
All of it?
I'd double it and add 20.
You know, there's something we never really thought of...
Actually, you may have.
Come on now.  People are smart.
But, unfortunately, you're even less attracted to guys you've never seen before.
The what?
Seriously.  I'm not going any further until you tell who you are.
Fine.  Good.
What about the other agents?  Ella? Tee?
Jesus, everyone's moving.  Could be an assembly.  Does it look aggressive?
Keep an eye on things there.  We'll see what we can find out at Ernie Goosels.
What do we have?  Are we showing anything?
They went right to the President.
Where's he making his big speech?
Just a guess.  But I think found a nest.
If I may, sir... what exactly are you offering?
And I assume you're bringing this to us because we're the most powerful country on the planet...
Can you see?
They're inside.
Please --
Agatha, you're never going back there.
She died?
I know... I do, too...
How did I not see this?  Agatha, who killed you mother?  Who killed Anne Lively?
It's all I could safely move.
How can I do what I do now?  Let's just say I spent a lot of time in the prison library.
How do I find the --
Show me just Agatha's data stream.
So she cleaned up.  Where is she now?
Uh-huh...
I understand.  Sir.
Yes, sir.
So give him a tour.  He doesn't know enough to ask the right questions.
What?
We won't let them.
Then come to my house.  We'll talk --
Everybody runs.
Yeah?  So?
Nope.  Somebody's thinking about this one.
That was easy.
Any ID on the shooter yet?
They did.  Make yourself comfortable.  We'll be back in an hour.
You ever get any false positives? Someone intends to kill his boss or his wife, but they never go through with it.  How do the precogs tell the difference?
Then why can't they see rapes, or assaults... or suicides?
Cops aren't allowed inside the temple.
Just a nickname.
What does he think of your chosen line of work?
There hasn't been a murder in six years.  There's nothing wrong with the system.  It's perfect.
Do I know you?  Who are you?
There's no way of knowing for sure. She could've forgotten whatever it is you're looking for...
I need your help.
Rufus, for Christ's sake, get up.
So?
I love you, too!  I love you daddy.  Love ya, dad.
I feel bad about that.  I need you to forgive me.
NO!
The precogs were wrong.
Who said I would?
The what?
I'm not.  I was trying to heal them, not turn them into... something else.
The innocents we now use to stop the guilty.
The safest place of all.
He's dead, Lara.
No, it isn't, Lamar.  There was nothing anyone could do.
I thought you were retiring?
Sean --
Anne Lively... But I never said she drowned.
What?
Yes.  This is from the twins, Arthur and Dashiel.  Agatha's stream was missing.  Now this one is from the cyberparlor.  Anderton downloaded it directly from Agatha. Watch...
I don't understand --
I know.  He came to me, told me about the missing data stream.  He was concerned that you might find it.
Danny, tell me what you're thinking.
How?
We teach the tech's to identify them and disregard...
Nothing.  No footsteps coming up the stairs.  No hovercraft out the window.  No clickity click of little spyders.  No one crashing through that door.  And do you know why I don't hear any of those things, Danny?  Because right now, the Precogs can't see.
People have gotten the message.  Gum?
Somehow, I don't think that was Walt Whitman.
How can you even tell?  You know how blind you are without your glasses.
I don't have any cream.  Sorry.
We used to, every summer.
But there's still the other two.
Do me a favor, Arthur, keep him on til I see what's happening.
You're Bobby, right?
No thank you.
When served warm --
So?
No. That's cool. Bring me back eighty.
Yeah 'women.' If I was a fag I could get laid in a subway.
Don't worry about me getting in. Just tell me where it is.
He's okay.
But maybe that's okay. Maybe that's just what you need.
You wanna get us busted? If Max found out you were turning tricks --
No more.
Show uncle Ricky what you made.
You gonna bust my horns, or you want spaghetti
Mommy's not home?
What time is it there?
If they asked for her, they're probably expecting blowjobs all around.
I'm not gonna mention Ricky to him.
Leave me alone. I haven't touched anything in months.
Yeah, well Max offers a lot of things. And I got news for you. He's not the sweet old man you think he is.
How could you let her see this?
What'd you say?
I don't give a shit. I work for her. No touching.
Come on, dude. The other chick's giving my best man a blow job in the toilet. I know the drill, I'll wear a rubber --
Yeah. Where is he?
Nah, man. He's just making contact. That's our man. The Welsh guy.
Ruiz don't like using names on cell phones. He refers to him as the Red Dragon.
What do you mean 'troughed?'
So, that's it. I'm out?
I don't understand.
I know.
Yeah. Sorry.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Traveling light. I like that.
You don't know where you're going?
Yeah.
Don't know much. I hear he runs a tight ship.
Thanks a lot. Don't worry about it.
What about boxing?
I'm not gonna bring it up to him.
I thought you hate that club.
Then why do you try to get in?
He didn't say we need guns.
Bullshit...
You wanna go right now?
Fuck him.
C'mon, man, not in front of the baby. Put on your seat belt before I get another ticket.
See? Now everyone's got one on.  What do you got there?
I'm not taking her to a bar.
This paint sucks. The white shows through.
Pretty nice.
I don't want to show up hammered. We're supposed to be representing Max.
Shhh... Hello, room service?
Forty-six.
Relax. You got one-fifty. You heard the guy.
Don't play dumb. You know what I'm talking about.
They said a hundred thirty-fifth and Twelfth.
What the fuck do you...
Look, man, I never met Ruiz, okay? I don't know what the fuck I'm picking up, what the fuck I'm dropping off, who the fuck I'm meeting. All I know is Maxie's still pissed at me cause I sold his fucking van.
What did I 'get?'
About what?
Fuck this.
I swear to God, I didn't do anything.
We're getting whacked.
C'mon, man...
Hey, Jimmy, where they taking us?
Wait a minute. You want to look at fucking penguins now?
You couldn't even get a hand job from bridge and tunnel posse, how you gonna get a gun?
Why?
I did! I paid for half the fuckin drinks!
Yes I did. You asshole! What about the room?
No more, man.
You're not getting a gun.
Easy...
That's a good idea, maybe I will!
You see a Ricky Slade?
Drinks are free, right?
Yeah. Me and my boy here are gonna be in New York overnight. I want you to pass the word around to the honeys back in business class that you all got plans for tonight. I'm talkin' a California style, Tupac, gangster pool party back at the hotel. And make that drink a double.
I'll tell him someone else told me.
So we just go eat with him and that's gonna solve everything?
Watch it...
Does anyone want another?
No, thanks, man. We got to head out.
Soho Grand, right?
Yeah. Grab one of the cards behind you. Call that number. It's my cell.
The 'job?' Alls I know is I'm taking you to the Soho Grand.
Not usually. Mostly Trustafarians.
She poured it for --
Unless spoken to, ain't that right, Horrace. Didn't you say that?
Four mimosas.  You'll love them. So here's the plan. I didn't say shit to Maxie, cause the man has acute angina, and I don't want to get him all worked up.
Shut it, man. Shut it. Tom is a square. He don't but dabble in shit. Maxie had me hook up a loan-back with him, through an Austrian passbook account.
What?
So, you must be the Red Dragon.
Mmmm-hmm. Where's the, uh, 'Dragon's lair?' Where do you live?
Yeah. This shit's fucking brilliant. I just fucking love the fact that you have kids driving around in pickup trucks with a mouthful of this shit, speeding their brains out. I gotta bring a case of it home to my mates. It's illegal back home, you know.
Bet you like that shit.
Heard where?
My papa taught me one thing: don't never bullshit a West Indian bullshit artist.
No, my mama. She's from Grenada.
'Cause I want in. And it don't take a lot to know you there, daddy.
Solid, daddy.
I'm working on it.
You din't have no 1, 2, 8.
Then skip it, man. But you slipping, baby. You done slipped.
I ain't drinking hot piss with you. Come on, Sam.
I don't want your money.
Now.
I can show you how to get out of prison. And it's no hype.
That's the last stuff you'll ever get from me.
When you go busting your fists against a stone wall, you're not using your brains. Cause that's what the white man wants you to do. Look at you.
Man, you been locked up too long, everybody conks. All the cats.
Let it burn. Maybe you'll hear me then.
Man, I don't want to hear all that.
Tell you this: you ain't no fool.
Look 'em up and and out what they mean.
Start at the beginning. Page one, the first one. Here --
A black man playing big league ball is something.
No. That's the name of the slave- master who owned your family. You don't even know who you are. You're nothing. Less than nothing. A zero. Who are you?
Who are you?
For evil to bend its knee, admit its guilt, implore His forgiveness, is the hardest thing on earth --
You can grovel and crawl for sin, but not to save your soul. Pick the lock, Malcolm; pick it.
I'm sure we can. This is a new sister, Sister Betty.
Brother Benjamin, do not rush, it has to be exact.
Next week, Brother Minister.
Shall I tell my sisters that we oppose marriage?
How do you like it?
The talk is everywhere!
Bembry saved my Life. The Honorable Elijah Muhammad saved my life.
You have to sleep for three.
Is my family here yet?
I'm not saying anything, preacher. I'm proving to you that God is black.
Please, go ahead.
Sure, man.
The sentences to run concurrently.
What for? I ain't white and I don't put out.
Brother Malcolm, I want you to meet Brother Earl. He just joined the Nation.
...That isn't a whore?
C'mere.
You hear me, girl?
What's your story, baby?
Lemme feed you, sweetie, while they hot.
Well, all reet, then.
Fine as May wine.
Naw, you missed me, copper. Try this on for size.
The hell you are.
You're too small to be Bogart.
Tell him about Baldy.
Yeah.
It isn't a hype, Shorty. And I meant what I said: join us.
How's the rest of the gang? You seen anyone?
What can you do?
So what about him?
Might be all right.
Watch your tongue, boy.
Believe it or not, you're safe here. The Judicial police will kill you. If they can.  This page?
Then I hope the one who gets me has got lots of kids. What do you want?
Off the top of my head, I don't know what they could've been.
[It's a permit to carry a gun in Columbia. The gun you're about to find in that suitcase.]
I'll call you tomorrow.
He's an old fashioned patrone with the worst reputation. He's high on my hit list.
How do I contact you? We still don't have the ATM info.
I show, you give me the information?
[The boss did or his brother.]
[The ransom money. At the drop. He said Tazinari, one of the policemen had taken it. He was crazy.]
[Not for a long time, sister.]
[I don't know. We were just given instructions to take her.]
[Who ordered it?]
[How do I recognize him.]
[Mr. Creasy. What do you want?]
[It's all up to you, commandante. Tell me about you and 'The Dreamer'.]
[And?]
[His lawyer. Jordan Kalfus.]
[That's what everybody keeps saying.]
Yes.
Nine millimeter. A Sig Sauer 226.
I'll probably kill them. Is that likely?
Fuck, I love Mexico. I live like a king down here.
Not for eight months. I was in Columbia looking around, but, nothing seemed interesting.
A bodyguard has to be close to someone all the time. Willing to talk. I'm not good at that.
Ein Klines Bisschen. [A tiny bit.]
The United States.
Why not?
Places where the road bends, places away from buildings, places where the traffic thins out. But you don't have to understand. I do. So no talking.
I go to school, don't I?
Calling for Emilio's macaw. I thought I heard him.
Maybe. Did you hear him?
They can stay for two weeks. I don't care.
I'm too old for him. Don't tell my friends.
Yes.
You need to practice.
It was in a book at school. Concubine.
But the Emperor of China had 1000 of them! How can that be?
I had to do my homework on them when I worked there. Also I enjoy history.
No, that was in Columbia.
I don't understand.
Good things happen, too, Creasy.  Like meeting me.
There's no such thing as tough. You're either trained or untrained.
Now that's a question. I don't know about your Mom. For me, the problem isn't in the glass. The problem's in between my ears.
You should break all my fingers, Creasy, then tape them back together. I won't be able to play the piano, but I could still swim.
Dyslexic?
It's war. The weakest suffer the most.
We'll be okay once she realizes I'm not a new toy.
You're paying me to protect her, not amuse her. Right?
Stay here. If you do something stupid, we won't get her back.
And now every mother with money in Mexico City wants bigger and better bodyguards. My own wife included.
Her beauty fucks with your mind.
When?
This is Mr. Creasy.
Well, think about going to sleep. Good night, baby.
You're going to miss Mexican Halloween. The Day of the Dead.
Lisa Martin Ramos, Mr. Creasy.
What? Who?
[Is that good or bad?]
So am I.
This is my jurisdiction. I want these men as much as Creasy does.
She's all right, Andy. It's just that I get one Saturday night off every three weeks, and I was expecting something better, that's all.
You call her up for yourself, Angie. I don't feel like calling her up.
My mother, boy, she drives me crazy.
Where?
Oh, I couldn't eat nothing. My mother just stuffed me right up to the jaws.
I don't feel like going, Angie. I thought I'd take this girl to a movie.
She musta kept you inna shadows all night.
He was here last night till about two o'clock. I hear you really got stuck with a dog last night.
I came to see you. How you feel?
I feel fine.
That's nice. I gotta letter from my husband's cousin in Abruzzi. His mother died.
Do you remember Emilio DiGiorgio, owned the tavern in Abruzzi?
You know the old man upstairs in this house. Old Irishman, always drunk. He got pleurisy. He was inna hospital two weeks. He died yesterday.
It's her baby too, you know.
This afternoon, about four, five o'clock.
You know what they say. They say things are no good in this house. Catherine, your son is married. Leave him in peace. He wantsa be alone with his wife. They don't want no old lady sitting inna balcony. Now I tell you what I think. I want you come live with me in my house with Marty and me. In my house, you have your own room. You don't have to sleep onna couch inna living room like here. We will cook inna kitchen and talk like when we were girls. You are dear to me, and you are dear to Marty. We are pleased for you to come.
These are the worst years. I tell you. It's gonna happen to you. I'm afraida look inna mirror. I'm afraid I'm gonna see an old lady with white hair, like the old ladies inna park, little bundles inna black shawl, waiting for the coffin. I'm fifty- six years old. What am I to do with myself? I have strength in my hands. I wanna cook. I wanna clean. I wanna make dinner for my children. Am I an old dog to lie in fronta the fire til my eyes close? These are the terrible years, Theresa! Terrible years!
Who?
Your son Marty?
Were the lights on?
I don't.
It's my feeling that you really want to buy this shop, Marty.
I really should get home...
I really should get home, I told my father... Well, I suppose a little while longer. I wonder if there's any place around here I could put some makeup on...
I'm afraid of being lonely.
Oh, I'm fine.
Maybe that would be a good idea.
Okay.
It's a very sad business, I tell you. A woman, fifty-six years old, all her life, she had her own home. Now she's just an old lady, sleeping on her daughter-in-law's couch. It's a curse to be a mother, I tell you. Your children grow up and then what is left for you to do? What is a mother's life but her children? It is a very cruel thing when your son has no place for you in his home.
It's silly of me to argue about it. I don't know the people involved.
No, I'm not kidding.
I came up to dance, wadda you think? You here with somebody?
Oh, no! She died right in the hospital...
Sure, what?
Sure, great if you ain't married.
Waddaya talking about, do you know what you're talking about?
What girl, what does she know?  Why don't you let her hold the baby once in a while?! Your mother, boy, she wantsa take the kid for a day, that's fine!
Thomas. He told me it was a very nice place.
You not ugly.
Oh, it's a sad business.  My sister, Catherine, she don't get along with her daughter-in-law, so she's gonna come live with us.
Oh, sure.  Siddown, siddown. Marty, tell her siddown.
I offered her, Ma, she don't want nothing.
I don't know. I don't think so.
You don't like her. You only met her for two minutes.
Hiya, Ralph...
Waddaya read there, Joe?
What nurses?
Get ridda her. This is money inna bank.
That's swell, Missus Fusari.
She's right. She's right. Young husband and wife, they should have their own home. And my sister Catherine, she's my sister, but I gotta admit, she's an old goat. And plenty-a times in my life, I feel like throwing the milk bottle at her myself. And I tell you now, as far as I'm concerned, if Catherine wantsa come live here with me and Marty, it's all right with me.
Well, I don't know. He sits arounna house alla time. You know a place he can go where he can find a bride?
Siddown, Thomas, siddown.
Aunt Theresa, you got this big house here. I mean, you got this big house just for you and Marty. And I thought maybe Tommy's mother could come here and live with you and Marty.
I'm gonna see you tonight...
Lemme tell it, Tommy.
I don't care about the intention. I just know your Cross Action is a plus on our side. I've seen it come through four times.
You talked to Walt?
Didn't recognize you, Red. When you get the clamp all the way down, open it as wide as you can and see if you can close it on the artery.
Never this close.
Where you think you are, boy? They probably never seen a olive in this country.
I've always had a hankering for blonde pussy myself. My wife's hair is a wonderful golden yellow, and this time of year it gets even lighter.
There's only one way.
You really think we hurt him that bad?
Hey, you been sneaking some reading outside the frigging Bible!
That's okay. Live a little, learn a little.
The door, Frank, the door! Where you from anyhow, Alaska?
You make a mean martini, kid.
We been had.
This outfit needs somebody who can find his way around the pulmonary anatomy when the bases are loaded.
Not without lots of praying and kissing the dice.  It's a different ritual but it works the same.
You know damn well I nearly puke when I look at her. I don't even think she's a real blonde.
I not only say it, I'll back it up twenty buck's worth.
Yeah, if I can.
Be right with you.
Like the Spearchucker said, that's possible. Anyway, it's been an interesting association.
No. The only thing to do is write General Hammond.  But it's hard to find a place around here for a private discussion.
You ever caught this bread, and forgive our syndrome before, Duke?
A football game?
What?
I want to talk to you, Pierce.
Obviously you don't think so, and I don't know why.
Right.
I'm sure we could find a date for your team. Why don't I take it up with Henry?  Thanks for the drink, boys.
I though you said we didn't have a drop.
All you have to do is ask.  The quarterback is saying they'll run the old Statue of Liberty. Their left end will come across and take the ball out of his hand and try to get around our left end.
If you don't know what you've seen, why should I?
As far as the greens maybe. I don't know if my putting would come back or not, without some practice.
Like the Rock of Gibraltar.
Radar!
Hiya, Ho-Jon. You got a piece of a shell in your chest, but we'll take it out as soon as you've had more blood. Hey, Radar!
How about squeezing him through into Dartmouth? If all he wants to do is catch lobsters, he can learn that here.
We'll need room. The sixth rib goes.
What do we do?
Be kind of rough on him if there's no blood. Why don't we close up and sit on him a couple of days?
They're coming.
Okay, Major, honey.  I'm going to have a couple shots scotch and go to bed. I'd normally ask you to join me but obviously you're a female version of the routine Regular Army clown. And that turns me off, so just leave my outfit alone and we'll get along fine.  See you around the campus.
Well, for college players that have been out of training seven or eight years...
We may be in trouble, I can't catch my breath. I've got the occupational disease of oversized ex-athletes.
There's nothing ridiculous about it.  A kid like you...
Something else we have in common.
You're leaving tomorrow?
Though I guess who it'll really be rough on is your husband.
It could be a purely impersonal thing. What matters is the therapeutic value of relieving your tensions.
I didn't mean with me.
It happens to be a matter of life and death.
I'd be crazy to think my virtue, such as it is, was more important than his life...
Second pint.
Yeah!
Homosexuality.
Big day. Two jaws to rebuild.
You can cut the bow.
I – wouldn't – wish – it – on – a – maneating – shark.
If you mean...  She is a lieutenant in the Army Nursing Corps, Captain.
Major Burns will be out of your tent in twenty-four hours.  Tell them Captain Pierce and Captain Forrest are on their way.
It's the only way we can make enough to put Ho-Jon through Androscoggin.
I did. First and only blow. So far.
I deeply regret this unfortunate incident. We try to remember we're a military organization.
I'll tell you my news. I'm retiring from football.
Yes, sir?
I can try, sir.
Damn.
The way I run an organization, any man in it has the right to speak his mind.
They can't do that to me!
Good morning.
I been out of action since I got over here five months ago.
No, we had a clear soup to start. This is a thick one and you ought to taste it. There's nothing like it back home.
A big, rich slob like D. B. Norton buys a paper—and forty heads are chopped off!
Yeah. You, too? Oh, Joe . . . oh, I'm sorry darling . . . why don't we tear the building down!
Against what?
Hello.
No.
You were? I thought you were chasing me?
Oh, I'm sure I can.
A hundred dollars!
A third party?
Yes, I know, dear, but Mrs. Burke had her baby yesterday. Nine pounds! And there wasn't a thing in the house—and then this morning the Community Chest lady came around and—
You remember those lovely people your father used to take care of? I thought I'd buy them some groceries. Oh, Ann, dear, it's a shame, those poor—
Darling, there are so many complaining political speeches. People are tired of hearing nothing but doom and despair on the radio. If you're going to have him say anything, why don't you let him say something simple and real, something with hope in it? If your father were alive, he'd know what to say.
You bet I will, Ma.
It isn't the money. We're after circulation. What we need is fireworks. People who can hit with sledge hammers—start arguments.
Oh!
There is no letter.
There is no letter. I made it up.
Uh-huh. You said you wanted fireworks.
Holy smokes! Wasting my time listening to this mad woman.
Oh.
No, no, no! You can't take pictures of him like that—eating a sandwich—and with a beard!
I got it all ready. Here.
Well, what about it?  Let them see him!  We'll go them one better. They can also hear him.  You own a radio station, Mr. Norton. Why not put him on the air?
That's fine, honey. Now, get out!
Say, all this John Doe business is batty, if yuh ask me.
Yeah, a little.
I used to pitch.
The heelots!
Sure. Mostly often.
Yeh. Er, and my boss, Mr. Schwabacker made a job in his warehouse for old man Delaney—
The elevators are still runnin'.
What was I doin' up there makin' a speech, anyway? Me? Huh?  Gee, the more I think about it the more I could . . .
Better make it doughnuts, huh?
John Doe Club?
Hiyah, John.  John, I want to have a little talk with you.  What's the matter—are you falling? Come here.
Yeah. It certainly is.
You're all wet. Miss Mitchell writes those speeches and nobody can make her write that kind of stuff.
Why, D. B., you're not going to fall for—
Okay. I just came in to get warm, myself. Come on, let's go.
I think maybe you'd better. And Connell—I'd like to have the John Doe contract, all the receipts for the money we have advanced him and the letter Miss Mitchell wrote, for which I gave her a thousand dollars.
That's right. You got it! Sure! He came in here and I made him change his mind. "Bulletin editor saves John Doe's life." Why, it's perfect. I'll have Ned write it up.  Oh, Ned!
Willoughby. John Willoughby, Long John Willoughby they called me in baseball.
It's not a lie! Nickels and dimes! To stuff into their own pockets! You can read all about it in the newspapers there!
That's too bad.
Well, I was just thinking about this John Doe business. Why, as soon as it comes out it's all a fake, you'll be washed up in baseball, won't you?
Feller runs the Chronicle .  Here's the speech you make—and it's all written out for you.
I think it must have been a sea- gull.
It was Warriors plus 6 this morning.
May I come in? I would just like to ask you a couple of questions.
Man, what's this about? Ya know, you were robbing a store. It wasn't personal. It was his job.
Are you going to turn on me too? Who helped you when you were strung out? Who gave you money? Who bailed you out of jail?
Particles, man. I feel them all the time. I feel them in my arms and legs man, that's how they punish me.
Tell him what, what do you want me to tell him?
Is that where you're family lives?
Then where's my FUCKING car!
Absolutely. Bank robbers are generally your smartest criminals.
Wait a minute, lemme see that.
Well he's a little fucking agitated -- he ripped the phone out.
What if you and me got into a struggle... and my gun went off?
Only at the very end.
A little exercise in lateral thinking. The obvious solution isn't always the only solution... See you tomorrow.
Spent my whole life there. I just wanted to get out for a while.
We could fill it with water.
Every couple of months, huh?
Do you really?
I think I can handle that one.
Then get out of my face you worthless piece of frogshit.
What? Bring somebody in so he can cut his nuts off?
It's against my nature.
A dirtbag behind the counter holding a sawed-off. A Berretta nine millimeter in his belt. A female hostage, red dress, on the floor in front of the cereal display. Male hostage, jeans and blue checked shirt, three feet to her right. Another male hostage, white pants, green shirt, Nikes, laying in front of the magazine rack. A female dirtbag with a gun under her shirt, sitting against the beer cooler, trying to pass herself off as a hostage, and there's a special on toilet-paper, four for a buck twenty-nine.
Now she's going out with Greg Barnett?
Yeah, first and second.
How much you wanna bet?
Occasionally you lose.
I don't know, but I've got to get on there.
You live with it... and they haunt you. It doesn't leave.
You've got to decide that for yourself.
I'm okay. Korda... went down the side of the building...
Husband came home. Found that guy and his wife "in flagrante". Now he's holding her at knife point.
Don't know. She keeps screaming to stay out. He keeps screaming to stay out. We decided to stay out.
What do you want from me?
Don't try to make me feel guilty. The whole time we were together, you went out of your way to prove you didn't need me. Now, suddenly, for one night, you need me again. I can't do it. I can't be more than your friend. Because I know what will happen. In a few weeks you'll be back on top, and you'll shut me out just as soon as you don't need me again.
If you did, you never showed it.
I was going to catch the last half on TV.
Mmm, needs a little something.
Veronica, it's not easy for me... I don't know if I can change overnight. But what I'm telling you is that I want to share everything with you, because I don't ever want to be without you again.
...Let me just show you.
Hmm?
You've changed you know. I don't think there's anything you can't do once you put your mind to it.
I mean I said this trip should be a 'roadtest'.
Come on. Stay up there, Cozy Girl...
Depends. What's up?
You let us worry about that.
Okay, I think I could swing that.
What happened to your Trans Am?
Who's running it!
Just that I'd talk to my superiors.
-- Two million people lost in the digital night.  What do they seek?
To live forever.
-- No.
Guests?
True.  But why?
In here I am.
It's not real.
-- He will.
New York.
The weather.
-- Yes.
Good question.
Insurance.
No.
Who are you?!
-- The inside?
Her?
Yes.
Way you kiss me.
I know.
There?
Resurrection.
-- Transmit now!
Uplink selected.
Speed?
IMPACT IN EIGHT SECONDS!
Yeah, right.
I'll be at the Observatory Sunday.
Activating Power Beam!
Thank you, Dulcea.  For everything.
What does that mean?!
Where did it originate?
Close.  Billy, you are the Wolf, cunning and swift.
TRICERATOPS!
I am the crane, agile and sublime!
WE'VE GOT TEN TRIACS BEFORE WE'RE TOAST!!
OUR MORPHERS ARE ON LINE!
THERE'S THE COMET!
Be the swallow.  Be the swallow...
A real shame.
BULK!!
Look closer.
How about Major Moron?
Did I say anything?
BUT I'M YOUR COUSIN!
Quack like a'duck!
You forgot to say 'Simon says."
Well, if I did I certainly wouldn't say it to you!
Strength in numbers!!
LET'S DO IT!?
You've got the public upset, Al.
And a lot more. Can we talk?
But ya got a Boss.
Got the same problem with my pop -- garlic. Nothin' you can do.
That ain't exactly been the lucky spot lately.
You scare me, Charlie.
I trust Mr. Johnson filled you in on the revisions.
Mr. Rothstein, Can I be frank? You're a gambler, and I know you've had losses. I also know you could sell to Maranzano or Masseria for fifty G's, but nobody sells to those guys once. So if ya really got another buyer, and ya wanna welch, I ain't gonna beef.
Could we step outside?
I cannot bear to look at that hideous suit one minute more.
Which is why he doesn't need us.
He's hidin'. Word's out Tommy Reina's goin' over ta Maranzano.
What are ya thinkin', Charlie?
We're gonna be the winning side. It's like Rothstein said about that guy in Austria. We're gonna use Maranzano and Masseria. Let 'em knock each other bloody. And then, when everybody's screamin' for peace, we step in to make it. What they're fight in' over, everybody will beg us to take.
For being a bootlegger?
I must be going.
I'm already late.
It's too late.
Why? You're the innocent one.
Guess I'm not a single type guy.
I'll talk to Nucky. Get you set up like the fuckin' Prince of Wales.
Like a party for all our friends.
It'll just be a few minutes.
The fat man's scared. Scared of us, and scared without us. Same with Maranzano. We gotta get their minds back on each other. This fuckin' peace is killin' us.
What's your problem?
Is there a fuckin' point comin' up anytime soon?
Come on. Tell us, Shitface.
Yeah. And no more Tommy Reina.
He's trying to make it.
Wassa matter, Mr. Big Shot. Don't have time for my business no more?
That little party's gonna make you a lotta money.
You can't kill me. You gave your word, Charlie.
I must know more of you, my son.
Don, you talk about honor, but you mean vendetta. Killin' an' more killin' until nobody can remember how it all started.
Sittin' around gives me the piles. You got a proposition?
Jesus.
If it comes to that. Yeah.
I'm comin' for my twenty thousand.
Switch hands.
I'm serious. It was bicameral disjunction - right brain and left brain out of balance. He was a rightie, so I made him switch the pencil to his left hand. Just to see what'd come out.
Left-handed, he was <u>funny</u>. He'd been doing all this scary, intense work...then he found out he could draw this stuff, and make me laugh, and he liked that. <i></i> And then the nightmares just...stopped.
Most we've ever used is half a CC.
Sad commentary, huh?
I want him to have every chance, Doctor. We can certainly give it...three months.
Do you know what kind of opportunity you have here? You gotta <u>strike</u>. I'm talking mansions. Lamborghinis. Champagne for mouthwash when you brush your teeth!
Why?
A piñata. That's a <u>great</u> idea!
He's stuck in a loop - a nightmare loop. <i></i> Anybody here know what Oneirix is?
Kool-Aid!? But who'd would want to -
Home sweet home, huh? Actually, I was expecting something a little swankier. How much loot does old Stu rake in, anyway?
<u>Well</u>, Miss Smarty, if I didn't go out, I wouldn't <u>need</u> any pants. Now would I?
I don't think so.
This is hard for me, Julie...very hard...but it's been three months now, and... <i></i> I gave the order.
Yeah. To see if he could expedite my case. But I wait, and I wait, and...I'm starting to think I'll never see her again.
Kitty...<u>my</u> situation is really not important. The thing is, my girlfriend is now living with, and possibly engaged to, a demented monkey.
You can't do this! You'll get in trouble!
Thanks, Kitty, I'll never forget you for th--
Sorry. The women here aren't my type. Most of them aren't even my <u>species</u>.
Maybe he wanted to pick out his own casket?
Like you'd know. You started out on the back of a napkin, you little...<u>doodle</u>.
Stu... It's a <u>party</u>.
Oh, <u>sure</u>. Mr. Action Hero! Why couldn't I be Arnold Schwarzenegger's figment?
What happened?  Did you lose your keys?
Well, I'd love to see inside your club.
Uh-huh?
That's the Satan's Disciples' New York headquarters.
No, I'm working too much, I don't have time.
Behind the books.
Oh, it's so nice to meet you.
My daughter lives right across the street from the Satan's Disciples' clubhouse, and I was so worried about her ... so, I went over and introduced myself. And they were the nicest people.
If it's about the bikers, dear, I don't want to talk about it.
Oh, I don't want to be in the way. You've got your career and everything.
Goodbye, sweetheart.
It's Marika.  Is Paula there?
Oh.  I thought today was Saturday.
Oh, it was such a big scandal.
... Manly?
... Oh ...
Yeah.
Oh, yeah ... yeah ... it's a hellhole.
It was done to stop me from talking about a section of the Appropriations Bill!
I did not--
I give that Trail Blazer five more minutes to show up--  --*five more minutes*!
I would cherish you--and stay sober.
You got worms.
You know--little worms--ambition.
What show? Would you mind telling me what's coming off here?
Who?
Frankly, kid--are you goofy?
They decoyed the little General off to a tea party to keep him out of the Senate.
He isn't going to hurt enough as it is. *She* has to twist a knife in him, too--the regal jackass! "I'll turn my glamour on him," she says--
No. How'd you feel? Quick.
I apologize.
I'll cherish ya.
Have *you*?
We're gonna get married.
Susan? Nah!
He's a house-afire!
Can't that wait, Hubert?
Why, I think it's very sweet of the children--
All set. Foley's rooms in the Senate office building--nice, big clean desk--lot of Senator stationery to write his little boys on--and Foley's secretary, Saunders, to make it look like the real thing--
I--I couldn't, Jim. Those men were--
I *won't* send Horace Miller!
Jim--the answer to a prayer--manna from heaven--the man *we want*--and the votes *we need*--
Jim--when the lightning hit, I--I just--
Me! Jim--how--?
Oh, a *boy*!
Excellent! Excellent! My boy, I'm convinced our State has a great debt of gratitude to you--
Why, of course.
Uh--could--could I help--?
Taylor! May I ask what *Taylor* has to do with it?
The porter's got them. They're coming.
What makes you think he's got *anything* to do with it?
To--to a reception--uh--for a princess-- I forget her name--
His last fight was his best, Jeff. He and his little four-page paper against that mining syndicate and all to defend the right of one small miner who stuck to his claim. You know, they tried everything, bribery, intimidation, then--well--
The *Bills*? Jeff--let me advise you-- as your father would--politics is a business--sometimes a cruel business. In your time here, you couldn't even start on those Bills. They're put together by legal minds--after a long study. Why, after twenty years, I can't understand half of them myself. No, really, Jeff--in your own interests--
Well, why not do it? There's a job for you. Get a Bill started to accomplish it--present it to Congress-- it would be a great experience--
What's to stop you? Saunders will help you with it--
Here--where are you running off to?
That's all right, my boy--don't bother--
Good as new! It's quite all right--
Every *aspect* of this matter--the gentleman's attack on that section-- everything--was dealt with in the committee hearing--
The committee ruled otherwise! The gentleman stands guilty as charged. And I believe I speak for all the members when I say that no one cares to hear what a man of his condemned character has to say about *any* section of *any* legislation before this house!
The gentleman has said repeatedly that he is speaking to the people of his State. He has been waiting, as he so fancifully puts it, for them to come marching here in droves. Would the gentleman be interested in knowing what those people have to say?
Excuse me for interrupting, Governor, but--  --that plaster's gonna harden any second, son.
The man downstairs said number--
Oh, no--no!  My dear *Senator*--it may be customary out on the prairie to take French leave of people and not be heard of again for five hours--
There *what* was?
Oh--a wonderful thing--yes. Get you right in the mood--yes--yes.
You *couldn't*?
Yes. Sure. It was his idea. *I* should have been the one to think of it--
Right.
Oh, just a day--
Committee, huh?
Why?
Some committee's got it.
What's that?
*This* is.
He did?
City-dwellers never do that--for fear of what might drop *in* 'em.
No, they couldn't. Father was a doctor. The kind who placed ethics above collections. That speaks well for Father but it always left us kind of--  Could we get on with this, Senator?
I don't see where we are *with* it.
Terrible, thank you.
Why?
I also answer to whistles.
Now, *Susan*--that's really a *pretty* name--
In Terry Canyon?
One of the plagues on members of Congress--office-seekers, cranks, people with pet bills. Get my son into West Point--or *outta* West Point. I've got a scheme to put people to work. How do I get rid of cockroaches? Some woman's composed a hymn to replace the Star Spangled Banner. Want to hear it?
Second drawer.
Do you want to dictate them?
Saunders--
Yeah. I see. Well--that's about the only thing to do. Don't you think?
To a hard night's work, son. Come on! 
Not *me*! Joseph Paine is the man they ought to be listening to! Come on!
You see--if we could take the poor kids off the streets--out of cities-- a few months in the summer--learn something about Nature and American ideals--
How are the pigeons?
I'm splendid, too.
Well! You don't say!
You're not going to take your *suit* off!
You were about to recognize me, sir--
Mr. President--I stand guilty as *framed*! Because Section Forty is graft, and I was ready to say so. I was ready to tell you that one man in my state--Mister James Taylor-- was putting that dam through for his own profit!
Oh--you're *sure* of that now?
A pet idea--you know--pension bill-- save the buffalo--you've got *one* notion you think would be good for this country, haven't you?
What do you mean? What's going on?
Listen, Joe--at least--after a day like this--I got one good bust coming before I start showing him monuments--
Yes--
But--you love him, don't you, Saunders?
I know, but is it worth the risk of a scandal now that a new man is going to the Senate?
Joe--do you mean to say--do you think you can actually *handle* this--this whatever-you-call-it in Washington?
Glad to know you, Senator. Meet the boys--
Sure! The fight's in the open now-- to a finish--!
Keep doing it! This is the whole works, Joe--we're out of business of bigger than we then we ever were. We can't miss a trick--we can't stop at *anything*--till this yokel's smashed up and buried so deep he'll never--!
All right, we'll take Jeff with us--
Senator Paine.
Will Senator Smith yield to--?
Order!
Will Senator Smith yield to his colleague?
Morning, neighbors. Morning.
Deeds?
Uh-huh.
Sometimes he whistles.
Yes, you own it.
Uh-huh.
Yes, indeedy.
Thank you very much.
I haven't.
No!
Yes!
Yes, but I—
Well, I guess I've told you almost everything there is to tell. My folks live in a small town near Hartford. I'm down here alone trying to make a living.  Oh, I'm really just a nobody.
Oh - uh - nothing.
Oh. What's happening about the opera?
What did they say?
What are they going to do?
Yes.
Me?  Oh, I see a small Ohio farm boy becoming a great soldier. I see thousands of marching men. I see General Lee with a broken heart, surrendering, and I can see the beginning of a new nation, like Abraham Lincoln said. And I can see that Ohio boy being inaugurated as President—  Things like that can only happen in a country like America.
Yeah. Anyway, there aren't any photographers around.
Oh, that—
He sounds like a person worth while knowing.
Sure. I can sing "Humoresque."
No - not at all. I couldn't sleep either.
I'd like to read it some time.
No, I don't mind.
No. It's nothing.
Hello.
What's gotten into you, Babe? I remember the time when you'd blast this town wide open before you'd let Cobb get away with a thing like this.
Listen, Babe - get me some stuff on this guy, and you can have—
I was the world's sweetest ingenue.
Last night he proposed to me.
Yes.
I'm going to tell him the truth.
Boy, was he burning.
Come on - let's go!
Yes, I know. A week's gone by and we haven't got the Power of Attorney yet!
Yes, sir.
Let me go! I wanna see him!
Let me go!
What was that you said he was?
But your honor—
Yes. You see, rich people need someone to keep the crowds away. The world's full of pests. Then there's the newspapers to handle. One must know when to seek publicity - and when to avoid it.
What?
I'll tell those mugs to keep their shirts on, that you'll be right down.
Not much. He's an uncle of mine, I think. I never saw him, but my mother's name was Semple, you know.
Who - me? No.
What for?
Oh, yes, there've been a lot of them around here already. Strangest kind of people. Salesmen - politicians - moochers - all want something. I haven't had a minute to myself. Haven't seen Grant's Tomb yet.
A lawyer representing some woman with a claim against the estate.  Tell him to see me at my office.
That's very kind of you. Are you related to him?
Huh?
Why do mice go where there's cheese?[3]
Some other time, Cobb. Some other time.
They'd call you anything if you gave them half a chance. They've got you down as a sap.
That's my job. I'll take care of that. I'll keep that stuff out of the papers - if you'll help me. But I can't do anything if you go around talking to people. Will you promise me to be careful from now on?
Will you tell the gentleman I'm not in?
Excuse me, gentlemen, there's nothing natural about that .
That's fine. Thanks. I'll look 'em over later.
That's awful. The poor woman should be taken care of immediately.
You'll excuse me, won't you? I'll be right back.
Oh no, I'm not. I don't like your face. Besides, there's something fishy about a person who would settle for a million dollars when they can get seven million. I'm surprised that Mr. Cedar, who's supposed to be a smart man, couldn't see through that.
No use in getting tough. That'll get you nowhere, Mr. Deeds.  You know, we've got letters.
Why, you must drink! All poets drink!
Take the stand!
Oh yes, I was getting to that, Your Honor.
Oh, the poet? Where?
Thanks, but Miss Dawson and I are going out to see the sights.
I don't know.
Now you keep out of this!
What's that?
I'd venture to say, sir, you don't remember much of anything that happened last night, sir.
You have no pants, sir.
Looking for?
Get out.  The evil finger's on you. Get out!
How did they threaten you?
Really? You think so?
I understand. I just want to know what the argument was about.
Uh-huh. What are they?
One hundred books?
Uh-huh.
What's that?
No, not really.
Not any more.
It could happen. What about his state certification exams? The records seem to be in order.
Dorothy Fowler. Fantastic woman. She passed last year in a train wreck. Damned Amtrak.
And please, for whatever small way I may have encouraged this, accept my apologies.  There is good news, though.
And the experiment is in here?
My name's Gilroy. I'm from the State Certification Board.
Nope.
We've been talking about her, mostly.
No, sir. I was empathizing. Sorry.
I'd better get in there.
I think it's like... inquisitive.
You're terrible. I'm never telling you anything.
Doc.  Ainge...
Where am I supposed to eat?
It's a pleasure to meet you.
Lily.
Come out this way. There's no shame in getting a little therapy... is there, Althea?
Thanks for your help, Lionel.
Is she a friend of yours?
Mother... go away!
Why don't you tell me?
Could I see Sofie, please?
Well, I gotta say, Mrs. Cook, you're right about that.
I saw it. I saw it in your eyes.
I'll come to you. We'll try a little walking.
Maybe you'll catch it.
We'll turn back anytime you want.
Something's bothering her.
What?
No.
So the headaches may not even be a part of this?
You actually address yourself by name in your thoughts?  So you really think having two opposing ideas in your head does some kind of damage?
Oh... this makes me sound irrational, which is probably right, but there was something about him saying this -- it was maybe the millionth time he'd told me about some preference of his. Well, I was so... tired of it.  Seems like my whole life someone's been telling me... I'm just not getting it right. Can we rest for a second?
In the capitol for Boy's Nation. Five days. Why?
You like it?
Yeah?
I don't know if --
No, it is not something I've heard about you! It is someth--  Why? Is there something I should have heard about you?
I think so.
What was that?
Part of it. We were watching "ER" until someone called.
You're not the only one...
Will you be here?
It's a big part of the show.
It's my bit for the community.
True. Should we stop them?
What'd he say?
First off, he tells me to stop smoking cigarettes. I told him abso-fuckin'- lutely no. As you can see --
No kidding... Panda. Where'd that come from?
Nah... scotch.
Unbelievable...  ...And Lily named her dog after him? Far out.
Yep.
You are Panda, monarch of modems.
Holy shit!
Everything flows from that, and what doesn't... can be easily purchased.
I'm honored.
Skip, you know that it's improper -- completely unethical -- for a licensed psychologist to carry on a romantic relationship with one of his patients?
I suppose your extended training was at an institution in that area?
Oh, yeah, very tough. But I guess that's good... to keep out the quacks.
The ritual to bring the body of Anck- su-namun back to life.
And then killing your sister.
Just looking for you, O'Connell! I wanted to be with my friend!
This is Prince Imhotep, High Priest of Osiris.
When Ramesses destroyed Syria, it was an accident. You are a catastrophe! Why do I put up with you?
Who needs smart women? I put up with you because your mother and father were our finest patrons, Allah rest their souls. Now straighten up this mess!
To have stopped this creature? Yes!
-- then perhaps, the golden Book Of The Living can return them to the underworld.
-- And read the sacred incantations contained inside it.
Correct, And that's when --
Yeah, get me a glass of bourbon, a shot of bourbon and a bourbon chaser.
Want to know?
The only thing that scares me, Mister O'Connell, are your manners.
Yes, I'm hoping to find a certain artifact, a book, actually, my brother thinks there's treasure. What do you think is out there?
And the fact that they say it's made out of pure gold, makes no nevermind to you, right?
Oh that's comforting.
What are those mirrors for?
The ten plagues?... You mean all ten plagues.
What?... Oh yeah, that was just um, you know, figure a speech.
I have no choice.
Drunkard? Fool? Rat-bastard? Please call me something original.
Oh no, not another worthless trinket, Jonathan, if I bring one more piece of junk to the Curator to try and sell for you.
After all, you rode us night and day to win that bet.
Still...
Yes. He's more than four thousand years old and still decomposing.
Shut-up and get me off of here!
Read the inscription on the cover!
What's it look like!?
Yes,... I see.
Yes, I'm all tears, now let's see who's inside, shall we?
What?
I was only strangling her... I've killed hundreds of women. It doesn't mean a thing.  Pootchkie, you're over-reacting. This is our night. It's what we've lied for... cheated for... murdered for. She's just a plaything, a trifle... You're the only woman who's ever meant anything to me. I adore you. I worship you. I want to make you my bride.
Do it, big boy!
Atta, boy!
I'm the Bowler.
He was cute though.
The Inscrutable Six?
What did he mean?
It's me... Elizabeth.
Thanks.
Well, I give to the United Way, and I feel that sort of covers --
Captain who?
You're dead.
Just a waitress.
Me.
You're a spy.
Roy.
Not tonight. 
I just want to be a superhero.
And you are a fool.
He is in love. His anger is gone.
LOOK!
What have the famous superheroes got that we don't?
Yeah.
But we know they're out there. Hundreds -- maybe thousands of lonely, unknown superheroes, who desperately need a cause...
But look at him... and look at us.
Like what? Cutting off my own ear?
Shhh.
No.
Yes.
Anybody got any?
Oh hi, Mom.
Looking for... the TV Guide.
But... the silverware?
Jeffrey... this is wonderful.
Who are they?
I got this cousin. He's a real doofus, but he claims he can become invisible.
Yeah, but how do we get to them?
But we gotta find out what's going on in there.
You know, General Kutusov, there is a very strong possibility that the fire was not started by Napoleon's troops but was organized under the orders of Rostopchin's secret police.
I have no doubt that he has, Your Majesty, but does he have any strong moves from which to choose?
And, what a delightful idea!
I'm sorry, I was at the theater and I didn't receive your note until I returned to my hotel.
Are you serious?
Properly arranged, yes.
The Empress, your son and the whole court left two days ago for Rambouillet.  Marshals Mortier and Marmont are probably still in Paris, completing the arrangements.
I don't know, sire -- she had the Tsar's personal physician.
I have never heard an unkind word about her spoken.
Bertrand, sire.
To Joseph Bonaparte -- Dear Joseph, I have been informed by my wife of the cold and spiteful treatment she has been receiving at the hands of my family, since my departure.  I am also informed that you have refused to pay over to her any of the money I left with you expressly for this purpose.  Must you, too, take this opportunity during my absence to indulge the petty jealousies of the Bonaparte family?
Let me see it.
Ajaccio.
I haven't been back for ten years. Is your family still there?
His paws are frozen and he cannot walk.
My God -- don't you recognize Mouton -- our regimental dog?  I would rather eat Cossack.
At first, it hardly seemed more than a routine fire.
What is that?
But this is not a matter which can be settled tonight, surely?
This morning, a Lieutenant and three soldiers came to our house and asked if we had weapons.  I explained we had only my late father's sword, which, in fact, was not a weapon but only a keepsake of memory.
I fear our meeting is long overdue... Napoleon.
Yes -- an excellent idea.
I'm afraid he has been rather upset by the outcome of the battle.
Francis, may I ask whether you wear warm winter underwear?
Yes, it is.  It must be one of the worst nights we have had this winter.
Yes, I am, sir.
Are you staying with a friend, sir?
Would you like to take me there, so that we can get warm, sir?
Do you have three francs, sir?
No...
And you, Junot?
Well, you shall see.
You are very kind, Madame de Beauharnais.  Do you have some sherry, perhaps?
I thought I was.  I was confused.
Of course.
One had better legs.
Promises mean nothing.
Open the door.  It's me.
Five minutes.
Indeed -- well, you may tell Dr. Corvisart, I should be entirely satisfied with half her success.
What are you talking about?
About Hippolyte Charles.
Yes.
Yes, of course.  What do you want?
Ah, you must forgive me, my dearest Marie-Louise, I saw it during one of my stays at your palace -- at Schonbrunn.
Oh, my dearest child -- you must not worry about anything.  I will teach you everything that you must know.
Does she deserve anything better?
I did not ask her to go to war against me.
Alexander and I are friends.  We have reached an understanding.
You may save your philosophy for the magistrate, Monsieur Varlac.  I am only a simple officer in the army, and to me what you have done is called murder, and his always been called murder by honest men.
Eugene de Beauharnais.
Citizen Bourrienne to see you, sir.
My mother has always loved me.  She would do anything for me.
If the French army had been commanded at Jena and Auerstadt by a tailor, the King of Prussia would certainly have gained the day.
Thanks, Unc.
Uncle Elroy, who's that girl by Day-Day's car?
Never...  But me and Suga can get real nasty in that Jacuzzi, though.
I'm his cousin.
That's cron-don, sir.  My mom hates for me to smoke, so she made me bud-brownies. Wanna bite?
Come on, Day, try it.  For moms.
What about the dog?
Well get along with this one.  Go ahead of us.  Don't get seen and don't let that mutt out of your sight.
Joker, he just got out of the pen.  Li'l Joker, he just got out of Youth Authority.  And Baby Joker, he just got out of Juvenile Hall.
I went back to Watts to sell my old car and met her on the way.  Worst day of my life.
That ain't the worst part.  Her little sister, Baby D.  She's the one that gets real physical.  But I got a restraining order on her, too.
I know what 'cha thinking.  I thought the same thing.  But it can't happen.
D'Wana brought Baby'D up here.
Still gonna smell it.
I didn't see nothing.
Naw.  I bet'cha it's something better than air.
It is easy. You know why?  'Cause they're not expecting it. Now, Roach, you gotta occupy Cheeco. Long enough for me and Day-Day to take a good look.
Naw, you go first.
Hell yeah, I remember you.
Better sooner than later.
What are you doing here?
Hold on.
Well bring yo' ass on...
I do.
All damn.
I feel you.  I've just been practicing that one move all week.  I thought that was it.
Are you out your mind?  I'm not messing with them S.A.'s boy.  You must be crazy.
Where's Craig?
I don't know, Debo.
He moved out to Rancho Cucamonga with his cousin Day-Day.
Yeah.
Huh?
Don't worry 'bout nothin', big bro.  He in the best fuckin' hands in Rancho Chocomunga, baby!  This my world, you just a nigga late paying rent.  Ain't that right, nephew?
I don't know.  Suga, go ask Miss Ho Kym if she seen them.
Oooh, ba-by!
I threw my back, again.
Uh, yes..
What?
Oh, yeah?
What can I do for you Mr....Watson?
I...
My security people are right next door.
It was because I had this...in my pocket
I saw her die. She was shot. With this gun.
I don't know. The only thing I know about him is that he works for your husband.
And your husband works for somebody else.
I'd prefer we didn't refer to it as my last speech.
I love it when pistolero's talk of trust.
For not believing you.
What?
I'd like to know what...
Yes, I'm listening.
It wasn't loaded. I didn't put the bullets in it.
Tell me why I miss him.
That's right, I killed him. He fucked up one too many times so I put a bullet in his eye. Then I put two more into him just to make sure. Now that was somebody I loved.
Keep your voice down.
How do I know you won't kill my daughter once I'm gone?
Well, you can trust Eleanor Samara Grant.
You've got to trust me. I'm putting my daughter's life in your hands. She's only six. She's just a little girl. Please, please, trust me.
He'll think you're in the crowd until the end of the speech. Wait a minute.
I'm sure. It's her husband. He's her Campaign Manager.
I know. Brendan, listen to me. Someone is trying to kill Eleanor.
Right.
Over and out.
I promise.
I'll have you out of here in two shakes o'f a lamb's tail.
Keep it.
Sure. Go down past the bar. Take you right out there.
Oh, man...
What?
Hi.
It's already done. I've already done it. You have to pay me now.
I think this is worth a dollar.
Gimme a dollar.
What?
I see. Where is this gun?
Not very far, honey-pie. Not far at all.
A surprise?
You' oughta learn to relax. I told you I've got it under control.
Go ahead, sugar Die.
Do it!
What gives?
He carried on some; kicked.
How come you got that stickknife hid in your bed-blankets, Preacher?
Keep talkin', Preacher.
Shoot, a horse-hair'll hold a lumpin' whale.
Don't need no soap. I'm boilin' down the fat from my hog.
Come on!
String that Bluebeard up to a pole!
Icey, I don't want a husband.
John don't like him much.
The boy worries me. It's silly, but it's like there was something still between him and his Dad.
What!
I know you did, Reverend. Oh, I know how you tried!
Sshhh...
She's gone to Moundsville.
John, where are we g --
That's Daddy!
Hurt her nothin'! Wash her's more like it!  Ruby!
She talks to herself.
A feller can't just go around with run-down, busted watches.
Huh?
You ain't my Dad! You won't never be my Dad!
Getting Pearl to bed. I --
NO, -- it ain't fair to make Pearl tell when she swore she wouldn't. I'll tell.
In the cellar. Buried under a stone in the floor.
Yonder.
Yes?
Because John said I mustn't.
Will you buy me a choclit sody?
I was praying.
No, Harry! I thought --
Yes.
It's not in the river, is it Harry?
It's about that John and that Pearl?
It was with this left hand that old brother Cain struck the blow that laid his brother low --
Them kids!
When did I ever?
Pearl and John.
Look, I know it's been frightening, I know your dreams have seemed real. But... it's okay. Okay?
Oh -- jeez -- Glen! Rod's gone ape!
Yeah. Something slippery all over here...  Tina?
Slept like a rock.
Okay, okay.  I think.
And if you can't do that, you sleep.
I guess those people don't wake up to tell what happens.
My dream.
You got a sane explanation for what he did?
What the hell you doing going to school today, anyway -- your mother told me you didn't even sleep last night!
You don't know he did it.
Hi daddy. I know what happened.
Nan, I --
I'd've canned your ass if you hadn't. What you got?
Terrific. What the hell was she doing there?
Keep your head -- this is a fucking flesh and blood killer we're talking about.
I won't.
It happens all the time.  I've got some warm milk all ready for you. Why don't you jump into bed?  I'm gonna turn on your electric blanket, too. C'mon, now. 
Great
Nancy?
Yeah. Just had a little dream. I'm falling right back to sleep.
Put that damned thing down!
S'curity.
Dead and gone.
They say you've bottomed out when you can't remember the night before.  No more drinking, Baby, suddenly I just don't feel like it any more.
Well then how can you say somebody else was there?
I mean, it was as if there were four razors cutting her at the same time. But invisible razors. She just... opened up...
Right. Well, she didn't, exactly...
I dreamed about this guy in a dirty red and yellow sweater; I dream in color, y'know; he walked into the room I was in, right, right through the wall, like it was smoke or something, and just stared at me. Sort of... obscenely. Then he walked out through the wall on the other side. Like he'd just come to check me out...
Naturally, Comrade.
Good evening, Ninotchka.
Well, I've saved up two eggs and each of my friends is bringing his own so we'll manage.
I have nothing to hide.
Thank you, Anna. I'll dry it up here when I wash it next. I should hate to see our country endangered by my underwear.
What do you wear in the morning?
You know I told you that Pavlov and I are going to get married when he comes back from the maneuvers. Would it be asking too much...
Just for the honeymoon.
All right, let's uphold it for another ten minutes.
He's a bad man. Sends people to Siberia!
Or it might be the firing squad!
That's another thing... it's spring.
...des raisins de Madère, des framboises... 
Leon, how would you like to have three lifelong friends?
How many families live here with you?
Just see how happy the people look... from here....
No, no.
Well, gentlemen, I'm afraid our rates are rather high.
Which part of the room is mine?
With two f's, if you please.
Good old Razinin! Is he still alive? How does he manage?
With our cream situation what it is, it is Russia which should apologize to the cats.
We have opened a restaurant...
The Duchess...
Well, gentlemen, how about my proposition?
Leon... Leonitchka...  Why are you so good to us? 
Decidedly. Yesterday I was greatly amazed when I came from the market and found that you had made your bed, sir.
Well, sir, if you should do it again, which I hope you won't, please remember the order. Counterpane, blanket, blanket, sheet, sheet.
General, please... if you hear any rumors that I am a charitable person, will you please kill them at their source?
Thank you, Louis.
Comrades, if we ring nine times... let's go in.
If Lenin were alive he would say, "Buljanoff, Comrade, for once in your life you're in Paris. Don't be a fool. Go in there and ring three times."
Oh, Leon, you are so good.
How can you find somebody without knowing what he looks like?
It's a real Paris reunion.
...so it blows up that big... what they call an Omelette Surprise!
...it is in the air... it may come around the corner as you walk down the street....
My name is Count d'Algout. I telephoned.
Get out of here!
Comrade.
Two thousand francs.
A day.
Just three people in a room this size? Whew!
Leon, Leonitchka, she is not going to negotiate! She is going to fight that injunction. She's going to make a precedent of it!
We did our best, Comrade.
I will not repeat your mistake. I will have no dealings with the Grand Duchess nor her representative.
Yes, Comrade.
Not always... look at me... I've been back twice. 
The Grand Duchess Swana... active in the White Russian movement?
So it's love which drags you to Moscow.
Oh no. No visa.
Why should I take a chance?
Me?
Gladly.
You're welcome.
No... I am looking for the Eiffel Tower.
Madame, it is that kind of approach which has made Paris what it is.
Nothing has occurred recently to shake my confidence.
Now I didn't say that either... naturally nothing would please me more.
He takes good care of that.
Thank you. I've had all the calories necessary for today.
We take off our hat and coat.  We sit down -- we make ourselves comfortable. We adjust ourselves to the prospect of a most enjoyable evening. We look at each other. We smile.  Well... we don't smile. How about some music?
Oh, I see. What do you use instead?
You know I want to...
Send me a plate of raw carrots and beets, beets predominating on a ratio of sixty-forty... What? There is a strike in the kitchen? Good! Will you assure the strikers of my hearty sympathy in their cause. I hope they will not weaken in their demands and tell them to put no dressing whatsoever on my vegetables... What? You won't serve me either? Now look here, Comrade, I think it is a fine idea to let the capitalists go without luncheon but when you keep food away from me you're weakening the people.
What are you after?
That's not a laugh! I mean a laugh from the heart. Now let's see. I'm going to tell you a funny story. Just a moment... I've got it! Well, it seems there were a couple of Frenchmen who went to America...
Do you like Scotch stories?
So do I.  Now, here's a great one... Ha! Ha! Ha!  Well, maybe it's not so good. Let's forget it! How's this? Two men are looking at the moon. One says to the other, "Is it true that a lot of people live on the moon?" "Yes, it is," says the other, "five hundred million." "Whew!" replies the first, "they must get pretty crowded when it's half moon!" Ha! Ha! Ha!
I've never been here before. I wonder whom you're thinking of. Oh, I know, a girl with a map, figuring out each step, worrying about north and south. Today... now this might shock you... I went up to a taxi and said "Eight Rue du Bois"... and here I am.
A wonderful idea! Radio or records?
Leon, I want to tell you something which I thought I never would say, which I thought nobody ever should say, because I thought it didn't exist... and, Leon... I can't say it...
Anything, Ninotchka.
I promise... I swear.
Ninotchka, you're jealous.
My darling.
From goats to grapes. That's drinking in the right direction.
There have been cases... but the headache the next morning is worth while -- if you drink it with the right toast.  To us, Ninotchka!
A funny story?
No, darling. I'll tell you another story, a much better one.  The only thing that will be over on Thursday is the lawsuit. There will be no Thursday for us. Not next week or any week. We won't let it happen. I'll tear it out of the calendar. Is that a good story?
Comrades! Good people of France!
No speech?
Well, then we turn twice to the right and stop at seven...
...but big.
The one I got they wouldn't let me read.  It began, "Ninotchka, my darling," and ended, "Yours, Leon."
Good morning, Swana.
You'd be surprised how many nice people dine with the Guizots.
Sweetheart, we won't have to bother about our future if you are willing to raffle off your past!
Yes, I'm your little Volga boatman.
A couple of bloodhounds and we have Uncle Tom's Cabin.
Rakonin, bless him, has given me the most amazing news!
Is this your new dress suit?
It's a dream of beauty. He never takes my word for anything, but I was right, wasn't I?
I'm going, Leon...  but before I leave I must compliment you on your gown, Madame Yakushova. Is that what they're wearing in Moscow this year?
I'm the one who should apologize. I should have talked to you before.
I'm afraid that's what it is.
Has done what?
Do you expect me to believe that?
Just in case they don't give you your visa to Russia I want you to know that I have signed a contract for my memoirs and rented a lovely little château in the Touraine, and if you feel the need of a change...
Dear me... I must be losing my finesse. If I'm not careful I'll be understood by everybody.
If you were encouraged to come here by our meeting last night I am afraid you misunderstood my attitude.
We have nothing to discuss.
People cannot be taken away, madame, neither a hundred and sixty million nor one. Not if you have their love. You hadn't. That's why you're not in Russia any longer, and that's why you came here this morning.
I told you to go, madame.
You were very careless with our precious jewels, my dear. They're too expensive a toy for two children to play with.
Don't worry. Fortunately last night a very trustworthy friend kept his eyes open. Perhaps he overstepped his function as a waiter but he fulfilled his duty as a Russian.  I just put this on for sentiment. The rest are absolutely safe. I assure you. But if you feel like notifying the police...
Won't those two years in court be expensive for you? I know that money was no object as long as you could squeeze it from the pockets of the people, but now...
Go on.
Yes.
I need very little sleep. We must be extremely careful what goods we take in exchange. I have already started a survey of our most urgent needs.
No.
That is for me to decide, Comrade Yakushova.
This will do. 
What is it, Rakonin? Did you lose your job?
Thank you so much, my friend. I will get in touch with you.
You did say it, sir.
But sir, we'll have to start over from the beginning.  We don't have the staff to ...
Pay him.  Pay him what he wants.
What?
Uh huh ...
Good.  You know how I feel about loyalty.  I'm not going to let any of my people go to jail.  That I promise you.  The important thing is to keep this away from Haldeman and Ehrlichman. I'm trusting you to do that, John.  I have complete confidence in you.
Yes ... I got the money.
It's the fall of the Roman Empire, are you blind?  And we're putting fig leaves on the statues ...
Yeah, I knew it.  I knew it from '69 on, and I said it all along, didn't I ...
I figured that out.
Christ, we created Frankenstein with those fucking Cubans.
Dick Nixon saying "I'm sorry"? That'll be the day.  The whole suit of armor'd fall off.
Jesus!  Through a window?
Is it legal?  I mean has anyone ever done it before?
I don't know if I'd go that far, sir.
Is the war worth it?  Is it worth a one-term presidency?  Because I think right now that's what we're looking at.
Forget it.  Ehrenberg's paid three times that much ...
It's marked.  Also there's June twenty third.  And this year -- March twenty first.  Those are the ones ...
Damn right.  And there's still a helluva lotta people out there who wanna believe ... That's the point, isn't it?  They wanna believe in the President.
This could trigger the impeachment. They'll go to the Supreme Court next.
Can the president afford to ignore a subpoena?
Congress is considering four articles of impeachment, sir.
Cox!  Fire him.
I'm afraid we have another problem, Mr. President.
It's totally out of context.  I was protecting the national security.  I never intended --
Can we get around this, Al?
That's right ...
I know it well, sir.
Sir?
It was just a fishing expedition. Apparently it was their fourth attempt at the DNC.
It's possible they were looking for evidence of an illegal Howard Hughes donation to the Democrats, so the Democrats couldn't make an issue of your Hughes money.
It was right after the Pentagon Papers broke.  They went in to get his psychiatric records.
That's right, and it's more a problem for Ehrlichman.  He fixed Hunt up with the phony CIA ID's, but ... what else does Hunt have on us?
How is this national security?
I'll talk to Helms.  Oh, Pat asked if you're coming to the Residence for dinner tonight.
I, unlike Senator Kennedy, have a plan to end the war.  But not for peace at any price, but peace with honor!
They had us bugged.  Christ, he had everybody bugged.  Yeah, he was gonna support me in '68, but he was also threatening me.  That was Hoover: he'd give you the carrot, but he'd make damn sure the stick went right up your ass.
I tell you, the soldiers were provoked.  Now stop this pussyfooting around.  Dead kids!  How the hell did we ever give the Democrats a weapon like this?  I mean, if Cambodia doesn't work, we'll bomb Hanoi if we have to.
Don't forget, the most important thing in your life is your relationship with your Maker ...  Don't forget to be on God's side.
Wait till the Mai-tais wear off.
Don't let it lose us the right-wing vote ...
Let him finish, Bob.
I believe you're right, boss.
Put Townsend in Belgium; it's available.
Why me?
Then this shall be our little secret.  Remember that I see into thy soul as God sees.  Thou may fool the world. Even thy father.  But not me, Richard. Never me.
What about happiness, Mother?
I promised the American people peace with honor in Southeast Asia.  That could take time -- two, maybe three years ... In the meantime, your agency will continue at current levels of funding.
Yes.
Well, we'll lodge a formal protest.
It is not my practice to spy on the president.  Doctor Kissinger manages to convey his innermost secrets to the world at large on his own.
Is that why you and Kissinger are negotiating with the Chinese?
But ... if we were able to separate China from Russia once and for all, we can -- we could create a balance of power that would secure the peace into the next century.
You must be familiar with my favorite poem by Yeats?  "The Second Coming"?
Edgar, think twice.  He works in the kitchen.
Turn this crap off, Clyde.  It's giving me a headache ... You may go, Joaquin.
How about you?  Are you going to win?
I'm trying to spare you an embarrassment.  Johnny Roselli is on his way back here.
Yes.  Your old friend from Cuba.
I know you've been very careful not to.  That's why I'm concerned.
I always get my man.
I won't tell him if you won't.
"A warrior with nerves of steel is yet broken by a thread of silk." Nietzsche.
Remember -- listen up!  Fire team discipline is there at all times. Keep your radios on at all times during the entire penetration.  Check yourselves.  Phony ID's, no wallets, no keys.  We rendezvous where?  The Watergate, Room 214.  When?  At zero three-hundred.
She's quite pretty.
Agreed.
That sonofabitch Kennedy is coming back down here tomorrow.  Dick, we're willing to put up a shitpot fulla money to get rid of him -- more money'n you ever dreamed of.
What do you mean, Jack?
The American people put me where I am.
Exactly, yes, Mr. President.  That is my contention.
... because people have got to know whether or not their President is a crook.  Well, I am not a crook.  I have never made a dime from public service ...
Fung pi!   I've only managed to change a few things around the city of Beijing.  I want to know your secret.
Looks can be deceiving ...
You just came down here for the weather, right, Mr. Nixon?
You know, this kinda thing, you gotta be brutal.  A leak happens, the whole damn place should be fired.  Really. You do it like the Germans in World War II.  If they went through these towns and a sniper hit one of them, they'd line the whole goddamned town up and say: "Until you talk you're all getting shot."  I really think that's what has to be done.  I don't think you can be Mr. Nice-guy anymore ...
Four.  Two boys.  Two girls.  And eight wounded.
How do you know that, John?  Did we try?  Are we just giving up like the rest of 'em?  What's Hoover found, for God's sake?
... but it was all we had.
You're shittin' me.
That man up there lived in similar times.  He had chaos and civil war and hatred between the races ... Sometimes I go to the Lincoln Room at the White House and just pray.  You know, the liberals act like idealism belongs to them, but it's not true.  My family went Republican because Lincoln freed the slaves.  My grandmother was an abolitionist.  It was Quakers who founded Whittier, my hometown, to abolish slavery.  They were conservative Bible folk, but they had a powerful sense of right and wrong ... Forty years ago I was looking, as you are now, for answers.  But you know, ending the war and cleaning up the air and the cities, feeding the poor -- my mother used to feed hobos stopping over at our house - none of it is going to satisfy the spiritual hunger we all have, finding a meaning to this life ...
What?  Win Vietnam, sir?
The hell with 'em.
POWs.  And their families.
Sir?
... and get rid of all these "goddamns" and "Jesus Christs"!
I know ...
It's not fair, Buddy.  I can take the insults; I can take the name-calling. But I can't take the losing.  I hate it.
Maybe I should get out of the game. What do you think, Buddy?  Go back to being a lawyer and end up with something solid, some money at the end of the line ... You know, I keep thinking of my old man tonight.  He was a failure, too.
You know how much money he had in the bank when he died?  Nothing.  He was so damned honest ...  But I miss him.  I miss him a hell of a lot.
It's over, Dick.
The girls will grow up.  They only know you from television anyway.
You're ruining us.  If we stay with you, you'll take us down with you.  This isn't political, Dick.  This is our life.
No, I'm not!  I'm finished.
Buddy, look at me ... just look at me. Do you really want me to quit?
Are you serious?
De Gaulle's gonna be there.  And Macmillan.  And Adenauer. Nixon can't not be there.
Do you really want this, Dick?
Then I'll be there for you.
Will you ... would you kiss me?
Then what are you scared of, honey?
Thank you.
Don't be ridiculous!
No ... it's just going to start now ...  If I could just ... If I could just ... sleep.
Hi, Happy.  Well, you're obviously making him happy.
The "crises"?
The Republican Party was never home to extremists.  You should know better. This guy's as stupid as McCarthy, and McCarthy never did you any good in the long run, now did he?
I deduced it. Once you walked in.
I generally make a fresh pot ever week even if there's some left over.
I don't know. Nothin'. Wouldn't be no point to it.
All the time you spend tryin' to get back what's been took from you there's more goin' out the door. After a while you just try and get a tourniquet on it.
Couple hundred on his person. Those hombres would've taken the stash.
It's not me he's in trouble with.
Some pretty bad people.
These people will kill him, Carla Jean. They won't quit.
If I tell you where Llewelyn's headed, you promise it'll be just you goes and talks with him -- you and nobody else?
Yessir. We should a brought wieners.
That's very linear Sheriff.
Llewelyn Moss?
Sir, I don't want to picture that.
He's goin' back out there and he wanted to know if you wanted to go with him.
I can't plan your day.
Lord no. I'm not retired.
I don't know. Had dreams.
Well I didn't see it.
I don't say anything. Except it was foreseen.
No. I found it.
Why would we go to Odessa?
Well -- how come?
You know what's goin' on?
No. This works better. With you gone and I don't have the money, he can't touch me. But I can sure touch him. After I find him I'll come and join you.
I know where it's going to be.
Is Llewelyn there?
In the truck.  I'll get it.
Not a bleep.
I don't need to talk to you.
Yeah. I know where you're going.
No. Do you?
Sixty-nine cent.
I seen you was from Dallas.
I was just passin' the time.
Now is not a time. What time do you close.
Sir?
...Where you want me to put it?
Yessir, be here til ten tomorrow morning.
Let's just call it square.
You seem pretty sure of the date. Did I ask you to sit?
That's not an answer.
Yes?
I'm sorry.
I'm just one person. Don't matter the size of the bed.
You want to change rooms?
Another additional.
Yeah but no one ever sees that. I like a man that'll tell you he's married.
I know, I've seen him. Sort of.
I know what it is. He won't find me again.
I'm a welder.
So what does that make me? Your buddy?
Too late. I spent it -- about a million and a half on whores and whiskey and the rest of it I just sort of blew it in.
To kill your wife.
No I don't have it.
Twelfth Infantry Batallion. August seventh nineteen and sixty-six to July second nineteen and sixty-eight.
No, it's nothing, I... my piranha just mauled me a little when I layed their food out.
Yes it was. Betty saw the whole thing! Your killer's name is Chloe...
Anyway, so what?
You said a woman couldn't have done it.
So you're saying Betty Sizemore -- our Betty Sizemore -- who you were in swing choir with -- has now hired somebody to scalp her husband in her own kitchen while she watched? You're amazing.
No, we're bringing the community into the effort to find her.
I'd like to apologize for our local boy. He's been in love with Betty since the fifth grade, y'see. He means well, but he's in over his head on this.
We think we know where Betty is.
I know plenty.
Fuck you, Roy Ostrey!
Hmm.  So, Del get that car he sold you up and running yet?
'Kay, good. Bye, then...
I have no idea what he was mixed up in... it was always something.
...to see you.
This is really awkward...
...what're you saying?
Honey, I'm really sorry, I was gonna call you about tonight. Larry's got a lodge meeting. There's no way I can get a sitter this fast.
Maroon.  I stole it.
I gotta go make dinner.
Are you and Larry happy?
What are you talking about?
Do what?
But I'm the one who's sorry. Letting you go was the biggest mistake of my life.  We were thirteen days away from getting married and... I just got scared. It's a mistake I've had to live with for six years. But it's behind me now...  And I hope you can put it behind you. I've missed you... David.
There was no plan! I was just young and stupid and scared!
Wow... You just gave me goosebumps, you know that? You make it all sound so real. Great improv...
...but I love listening to you, so that's okay...
Why are you screaming at me? I mean, what am I... why am I here? I don't...
Mmm-hmm. Listen, I forgive you, Mr. McCord...
What's so special about it?
All right, then. Actually, I'm glad you're going out. I got something going on tonight. Some serious clients, with real potential.
Thanks, Roy, you're sweet... a big liar, but sweet. I liked your editorial this morning...
Well, I was worried about you and I wanted to make sure you were alright... and I guess I was sort of hoping I could ask you about what happened...
You did? Was it anyone that you...?
I begged him to let me put that on!
Hi, I'm Betty. I'll take a Miller, if you got it...
Betty Sizemore. What do you mean you wrote it?
No, no, no. We know all that. What happened with you?
He has no heartbeat!
Oh, I dunno... but just once I wish I'd run into a guy who noticed the Koi before my tits.
Who?
If you didn't want to do it, you should have said so! Is this about gas money?
Oh, God! You scared me! Yes...
To a party in the Hollywood Hills.
Yes. I'd never been in a place like that before.
No, almost never.
Does he ever talk about medicine? His patients, the hospital?
Where are you going?
There was blood everywhere, Rosa. I saw it, I think I watched the whole thing happen... Oh my God...
I don't think so.  Rosa, I didn't kill Del... they did.
Did you know the most brutal, inhumane prison of the entire war was in Georgia?
If we're for real?
No...
The Indians, Injuns, whatever. They're always drunk and doing stupid things.
Driving their cars into trees... puking on the sidewalk... stupid shit!
...and put them in your mouth.
That's what I thought.  You better give me another example.
Actually, I scalped him, and then you killed him.
You think so? Joyce says she's timid.
A 'Finn?' What is a Finn?
It's not an exact science, Wesley. He said they'll be here... My Houston contact has always been very reliable.
Betty would never dress like that. She's not some trailer park slut!
Worse... you're in Texas.
...yeah, I got it.  Come on, you're stretching out my vest...
Aren't you a sweetheart... no, not quite. Anyway, she's been with us awhile.
I can't tell you how much it hurts me to hear that you married him.
I'll think about it.
"Would you like ground pepper on that salad, Ms. Branch?" Remember?
No! Let me try this!
Then do as you're told. Get her back.
Ahh, Mercedes, I think. Black.
Better.
What are you talking about? Killing's totally natural. It's dying that isn't natural...
Ahh, I hate this town! Places like this just make you small...  I should have never come back here after college.
Probably the same thing my mom would do if I got engaged... have a heart attack.
I'm the one who watched the show... I was...
I wish I could help you, but I can't.
Is this Neighborly Life Insurance?
Our pleasure, Big Dan.
Do not seek the treasure!
No, they never did turn me into a toad.
Good Lord, what do we do?
Don't know, Delmar-though the blind are reputed to possess sensitivities compensatin' for their lack of sight, even to the point of developing para- normal psychic powers. Now clearly, seein' the future would fall neatly into that ka-taggery. It's not so surprising, then, if an organism deprived of earthly vision-
Gopher, Everett?
Course it's Pete! Look at 'im!
Oh my God!
Okay, Pappy.
Problem a p'seption.
Assa good idea, Pappy.
In any state.
Well now, I don't believe assa property scription.
Cain't beat 'em, join 'em.
Enticements a power, wealth, settera.
That's good, honey.
- in the gods - Huh?
You said -
Well, we need that ring.
Uh-huh.
That wasn't my doing...
Well sure, honey, but...
Don't I know it.
Sell that. I figured it could only have painful associations for Wash.
Pete, don't be ignorant-
Million point two.
Pete, the personal rancor reflected in that remark I don't intend to dignify with comment, but I would like to address your general attitude of hopeless negativism. Consider the lilies a the goddamn field, or-hell!- take a look at Delmar here as your paradigm a hope.
Quitcha babblin' Pete - time to skedaddle.
I shoulda guessed it - typical womanly behavior. Just lucky we left before they came for us.
I cain't help it, but that's a wonderful thing to say!
It just never fails; once again you two hayseeds are showin' how much you want for innalect. There's a perfectly scientific explanation for what just happened -
How can I lay hold a the Soggy Bottom Boys?
He's a suitor!
Yes, sir.
What for?
Thank you, sir!
You were out at sea! Hey, guess what? I graduated. I got my degree.
Yeah, I made some money down there, then I talked my way into another college and I did it. I wasn't magna cum laude but I did okay. You should've seen me in my cap and gown.
Wha-chu-say, palequero? Short time, long time, only ten dolla.
Nobody. Just a girl I've been making it with the last couple of weekends.
What if I want to talk about her, pard? What then? You know, that's all I've ever heard from you, since I was a kid... you never want to talk about that, man, and it's important.
Don't lose any sleep over it. I wouldn't mind being the first woman to fly a jet fighter in combat.
Ever heard of knocking, mayo?
I don't mean anything by it.
I'm doing okay, sir.
Stop eyeballing me, Mayo, or you're out!
Get on your feet and find out how good, sir.
Well, goodbye.
Pardon?
I called you Sarge.
No, sir.
Yes, sir!
But you knew right off what I was talking about, didn't you, Paula! Did you let that boy --
Yes, ma'am. Four long, hard weeks of sacrifice for my country... for my people... for you. But I survived.
What do you care? Suppose I was pregnant. Just suppose it. You don't think I'd try to make you do anything you don't want to, do you?
Oklahoma. I can get my old job back at JC Penney's. In a couple of years, I'll be floor manager. Oh, you're gonna love Oklahoma, Lynette. You and mama'll get along just great. Of course, money will be a little tight for a while, but we'll make it.
Don't worry. It grows out about an inch by them.
Great.
Big Sid came in about two and a half seconds, then had the nerve to ask, 'Did you make it, too, sweetheart?'
No, but I told him I'd be at the Town Tavern next Saturday night, and he sounded like he might come.
I haven't made up my mind.
Lynette, just keep your mouth shut until we get to the motel. Will you do that for me, please.
Of course. I don't want no Okie from Muscogee. I can get that right here in Port Angeles.
No, and I'm not looking for one either.
Not me.
To meet interesting people, improve myself. You wouldn't believe the losers we got over in Port Angeles.
You're a very pretty girl, Paula.
God.
I understand. Maybe we'll see each other after the show...
No, it's okay. It was a great free meal. Everybody was so uptight I felt sorry for you.
What would you do differently?
Why'd your mom marry that guy if she didn't love him?
Twenty-two years ago.
So?
Why'd he do it?
I'm not playing any games! Go look at Lynette's!
Come on, Paula! You were looking for a ticket out of here and you didn't care who it was, any more than you cared with the last class of candidates you and Lynette fucked your way through, looking for a husband! Or the class before that!
Beware of the Puget Debs -- and we all laughed, especially him.
Hey, Sid, thanks.
Yeah. All week long.
He said he grew up poor?
A little.
You'd better get smart, man. It's time to walk away.
That's what they want you to think, but I saw where she lived, what is she's trying to get away from.  Just take my word for it, pard. Break it off now. Do it this week.
I can't let her go off and have the kid by herself and not do anything. If it's my kid, too, then I've got a responsibility, don't I?
I don't know... I felt like... like I was suffocating... Christ, Zack... I was so scared... so godddamn scared...
I don't get it! He's the best candidate in our class! Ask anyone! The best student! The best leader! The best friend to everybody! Couldn't you bend your goddamn standards just a little?
A woman and a little girl, both asleep upstairs.
Who's the clown now?  Huh?!  Who's the fucking clown now?!
That's right.
It's not her fault, it's not her fault, the guy must have called them.  Look, look, look, she's telling us.
You finish.  Then we finish.
You're here with me, you're already on the hook for one.  Buy one, you get the rest for the same price. You know that.
Hey man, it's the neighbor's house, who breaks in through the neighbor's house?!
Shut up.
She lied.  Cops woulda been here by now if she called 'em.  Besides, Junior cut the phones.
We'd like to come in.
Evan, I am so sorry, you were a saint to wait for us!
I said open the door.
Could you slow down a little?  Or we could wait for the car...
This is it?  I told you on the phone, I have to be moved in in two weeks.  Sarah, please don't bounce that here.
Got us in here, didn't I?
PANIC ROOM!
Wait.
They can't.  They can't get in here. No.  They can't.
I don't know, why?
Blue is phones?
Uh uh.
He --
I was trying not to tell you...
What if I keep dropping?
They're hurting us, baby. Huey locked up. Bobby Seale running all over the country holding things together. Cy dead. Little Bobby... I don't recognize half the faces at meetings.
That's just it Huey. The pigs don't know how many Panthers there are. Both of us show and they might start putting 2 and 2 together. We're not even two hundred strong yet... but we got 'em guessing thousands.
Yeah... whatever you say.
Fuck how they operate. Just do it. like your man says, "By any means necessary."
Who's they?
Party needs the bread.  Be hip to the struggle, only a dollar!!!
Yeah, it was alright. Hey, can you give me a lift?
No, Panther Headquarters.  Least that way we could hang out more like we used to.
Can you make a deal with them?
That would be an excellent start.  Tell him to keep a low profile.
Chief Dorsett, if the Black Panthers are going to remain in your jurisdiction, some fundamental changes in attitude need to be made...
Cut the crap, you've been taking the man's money for years. Now it's time you earned it.
Yeah, but aligning with white organizations. I'm not sure now's the time.
Not good enough Rodgers. Not good enough at all. Black terrorists on the floor of a State Capitol. I will not say this again, these Negro Commies are to be stopped and now. You tear them down. Either from the outside or the inside.
Rallying cry, it's an insurrection. Seale, that god damned Cleaver, Where the hell do these guys come from?
Yeah... but it seems they're bringing Malcolm's widow Betty Shabazz to town, to speak at a rally, do an interview for Ramparts.  And they want us to help with security.
We need money first...
Wait a second there brother...
I don't know.
Yeah I know. You're smart Judge. You ain't no bourgeois nigger like those Paper Panthers across the bay. I need every good man to help us with the security on Betty Shabazz, particularly soldiers. You do solid on that I might have something else for you, something real important.
Bullshit...
Not at all.  I'll catch you later.
What?
Why didn't you tell me?
Yeah... Look man, what I gotta say. It's just you, me and the rats, right? Alright... well... Sabu's back.
No... wait, there's something else, something weird. I hear he's set up down at that warehouse on fifty deuce. He's talking big and living bigger.
Yes... No... Mom it's not like you think. They're alright. There out there trying to do something.
You call that a compliment?
That would be nice.
You're the worst of that sort. You're the sort that gives that sort a bad name.
I've just been inside the mind of a genius.  Lord Cornwallis knows more about war than I could in a dozen lifetimes.
Oh, right.  Baking powder, we need baking powder.
Thank you.
Thomas is dead but you've done nothing for which you should be ashamed.
Do you?
With a lace table cloth?
I will do so as soon as possible.
Probably.
Difficult, sir.  This is, as you pointed out, a civil war.
You know how old I am.
And the dogs, too, I'll wager.
Father?
She got me at a more impressionable age.
I see, do as I say, not as I do.
I stand corrected.
You said bribery twice...
I'm a parent, I don't have the luxury of principles.
Last anyone saw, riding hard, northeast, his staff a hundred yards behind, trying to catch up.
You expect Cornwallis to be held here by militia?
How many men does Cornwallis have under his command?
Goodbye, Harry.
Thank you.  Maybe all of this will buy him some peace.
Robert.  Robert E. Lee.
I'm familiar with appropriate behavior at a military parley.
Six-pounders.  Lots of them.
Quiet.
Yaay!
Yaay!
To remember.
I know.
And I'm going to eat his breakfast cereal, too, even though it tastes like boogers. And...and...
Well, but Missus Creed! It ain't quite that way, deah!
Ayuh, I think 'twas. If I see Louis come home before I go to bed, I'll tell him to--
Movin' in's mighty thirsty work. I usually sit out on my porch of an evening and pour a couple of beers over m'dinner. Come on over and join me, if you want.
Ayuh--they get older as you go toward the middle.  Pete LaVasseur's dog is buried there...  the Stoppard boys' racing pigeon that Missus Cowley's cat got...and I think that's the cat himself right there, although it's been so many years I can't tell for sure.  Missy Ellen! Come over here just a minute!
I think it is so, Ellie.
Maybe when they call I'll just tell Ellie I haven't seen the damn cat around. You know?
Yes.  Where are we going, Jud?
Is there quicksand?
Whose burying ground?
Don't worry about that.
What?
Well...a touch of the flu...
This babe has said enough.
You're thinking of things best not thought of, Louis.
The power of this place is old and always restless. Sometimes the dead do more than speak. Remember, doc.
You don't understand--
Timmy Baterman. That was wrong.
Jesus, the road!
Jesus, Rachel, what's got into you?
I just said--
That's forgotten.
Yes, I guess I do.
Oh Louis, I just don't know about this--
She.  Goes.  Free.
Quite, boy, or you'll lose your tongue.  Those as know me know I wouldn't cross my word, and bring down bad luck on the ship.  I agreed to set them free.  I didn't when ... nor where.
Let's say I tell you the wrong person.  What would you do?
All right then.
Remarkable how often those two traits coincide.
By the powers, you're right!  Where's Jack's pistol?  Who's got it?  Bring it forward!
Of course.  I didn't steal it, if that's what you mean.
Can I trust you?
It's a pirate medallion.
Commodore, you can't do that!
Your father is frantic with worry. Our mission was to rescue you and return home.  That is what we shall do.  Mr. Turner's fate is regrettable.  But so was his decision to engage in piracy.
Or, rather, Commodore Norrington ... a fine gentleman, don't you think?  He fancies you, you know.
If an adversary demands parlay, you can do them no harm until the parlay is complete.
Will, how many times must I ask you to call me 'Elizabeth'?
To keep it away from them?  No pirate would sail to London, for fear of Execution Dock.
It won't.  It won't, and so we won't.
A month?  Will doesn't have a month!  We've got to do something to help him!
Now I must hear this song.  An authentic pirate song.  Have at it.
You'll be positively the most fearsome pirates to sail the Spanish Main.
To the Black Pearl.
First -- have you found me a crew?
Aye, and that's why I know where it's going to be, and that's why I know what Barbossa is up to.  All I need is a crew.
What?  He never told me that.
We're not going to just surrender!
The wind is quarter from astern ... by the time we're underway, we'll never catch them.
No ... somone has to make sure this dock stays off-limits to civilians.
Smith.
Surely you've heard the stories? The Black Pearl sails from the dreaded Isla de Mureta ... an island that cannot be found -- except by those who already know where it is.
Why ask me?
So it is that you found a girl. Well, if you're intending to brave all and hasten to her rescue and so win fair lady's heart, you'll have to do it alone.  I see no profit in it for me.
My business, Will.  As for your business -- one question, or there's no use going.  This girl -- what does she mean to you?  How far are you willing to go to save her?
It's not true my father was a pirate.
Don't worry.  I've already got a Quartermaster -- there!
The pistol.  When a pirate is marooned, Will, he's given a pistol with a single shot.  No good for hunting, or surviving, really.  But after three weeks of starvation and thrist -- the option of that pistol begins to look good.
This way!
Are you sure?  Jack -- this is not something you have to do.
My name is Will Turner, the son of Bootstrap Bill Turner.  His blood runs in my veins.  You need my blood.  And on my word I will pull this trigger, and sink all the way down to Davy Jones' Locker!
Yes, I have.
But I've seen a ship with black sails.
... no.
Mentioned it, is more what he did.
A moment.
You got it, Dr. Argon.
But in another twenty-four hours the core meltdown will be beyond the stabilization period.  There will be no way to stop it.
I suppose you are going to tell me where it is going.
Oh no.  You're not like me.  In fact, I'm betting you're the same greedy, remorseless, egomaniacal bad guy you always were.
That's right.  And making me was the biggest mistake you ever made!
You're not rotting meat.
She's lying.  She lost the first one on purpose.
Now, Icky, I don't need you winding yourself up.  I need you focused and in control.
You don't either.  We won't know anything until we find that guy and find out if he's alive or what.
In the meantime, we're going to need someone to deal with that mess in the lab.  I don't think we should call Dr. Bright.
Dr. Nebbleman, I want to know the moment the nanobot arrives.  The instant, understand?
Yes.  Yes, of course it is.
If you honestly trust me, then you'll have to trust me.
Oh yes, Icky.  I can feel it.
If you loved me like I loved you?
The nanobot is gone.
Well, yes.  The replicators are not as active at low temperatures.
The trunk.
In the meantime, why don't you find something useful for Dr. Bright to do.
Look, asshole, I don't got time for this.  If you got a problem, you better take care of it yourself.
What did he want?
That's right.  C.D.C. found out and closed them down...
Yeah.  But it wasn't a group.  It was one man.
They'll in validate the key. Probably nothing.
The replicators?
I hope you're right.  I'd feel a lot worse if he had read them and just didn't care.
Dr. Argon, I know you want to use the nanobot on yourself, but you mustn't.  The situation is critical right now.  The replicators are growing exponentially.  If we wait much longer it will be too late. You have to use the nanobot to stop the meltdown.
No!  Well, not those exact words.
Make me?  How?  You think he's going to torture me?
It's Sim.  We're almost there.
And if we evacuate, what do you want to do with O'Brien?
What?  No kiss?  Not even for old times sake?
You know, this and that.
Is that so?
I can't help it, Suze.  It's this place.  You know how I get in these stores.  They freak me out.  All these tiny boxes, little cans filled with eight syllable God knows what.
It escaped from the lab before we could finish the experiment.
Yes.
Daniel!
The nanobot is still inside you. It's programmed to exit through the urinary tract.  We need it as soon as possible, so swallow those.
If you don't want to do it this way, I can remove it surgically.
The nanobot is the only thing that can stabilize the waste.
That's right.
No, why?
I'm sorry, Daniel, but you have to admit it's pretty ironic that you of all people would be the first man ever polymerized.  It's got to mean something.
Just giving credit where credit is due.
No problem.
Getting used to it.
It's a crime fighting costume, what do you think?  It's underwear, so if you lose your clothes you'll still be decent.
I can't go back to jail.  I gotta get out of here.
Let's go.
We don't have time to argue, Susan.
You were looking for us?
Mr. Sim?  Do you have him?  He's alive?
I am aware of Dr. Argon's frustrations.
Pipe down, brain lady!  And you...
Goodbye, Stew—
Decent? Why Miss Schuyler, I want to be noble.
Certainly. Right over there.
You may go, Smythe.
Well, I tell you, yesterday when I was here, I had one of your books in my hand, and when I got outside, I realized I still had your book in my hand. So as long as I had your book in my hand, I thought I might as well take it home and read it. This morning, I got up and put your book in my hand, and here's your book in your hand.
Your mother will want to kiss me? Give me back my letters.  That's the breaks I get. It's the mothers that are always grateful to me.  Here.
Yeah, I haven't figured out the plot yet, but it's laid in a Siberian village.
It's all right. It's all right, Anne. I can take a hint. A bit subtle, but I get it. It's all right.
But we don't need it, I'm sure.
Oh no. No, no. Not me. I haven't worn these things for Years.
Besides I'd look foolish. I couldn't look Gallagher in the face.
Gallagher!
Gallagher?
Didn't I? That's funny. Isn't it funny?
Yes, I said it. Sure, I said it. I didn't say it for publication, however.
What am I going downstairs and tell those people?
Are you crazy?
Your house?
Stewart!
I should say you had. At the rate you two are going, we'll have to leave the country to save our faces.
It was a miracle. The man was ill or something.
Mother!
You're the Tribune man?
Well, I should say!
Yeah - go on.
I'll bite. What's the catch?
Sure, sure. That's all right. That was a great story, Bingy. A great story - wish I'd printed it.
Yeah?
Do you call yourself a reporter?
No? Well, where were you when that happened?
No, no - it's true, all right, only we didn't want to get it in print yet, that's all.
Quitting? I'm not thinking about quitting.
That's so.
Yeah, live on my salary - that is, until I finish writing my play.
My play.
Sure.
Your valet, sir.
Dawson, sir.
Drunk, sir?
Thank you, sir.
Yes, of course. Miss Ramsey telephoned me. Well, what would you like to have?
Thank you.  Where is Mr. Smith?
There's the third one. If I don't get the last one, there's a certain sob sister I know that's going to get a kick right in the . . . oh! Whoops, almost had that.
On now, Stew, don't be too hard on her. I wouldn't call her a brewery horse.
Well, I've just been able to get off that Norway coast - so far.
Grayson - Anne's lawyer.
There's nothing sudden about that—  He's always loved the girl, but he was such a sap he didn't have sense enough to tell her. Well, that's all right - we can fix that. He will go to the little O'Brien girl, and - here, I'll show you.
Just a habit. Mr. Schuyler is a bit put out by all the rumors going around.
Surely, come right in.
I beg your pardon.
And now for that twentieth crack—
It's all right. Bring him in.
"Cinderella Man Grows Hair On Chest!"
Oh, so you did give her ten thousand dollars, eh? and there are letters...
About what? Your marriage to Anne!
Have you seen this? 
Yes, I'm sorry, I struck him right here in your house. And I'll strike anybody in anybody's house that calls me a Cinderella Man.
Smythe, come here. I want to talk to you.  Come on, Smythe, talk to me. Smythe, I'm going nuts. I'm going nuts in this house! This big . . . come on, I'm not going to hurt you. Come on, what's the matter with you?
No, sir!
Sure.
It doesn't matter.
... Sex.
I can't go out there. How can I go out there?
What?
Thanks. I thought you weren't gonna ...
Hello Bill.
Bud brought it to me.
I've got to go ...
I don't know.
Oh, swell. You know, Mr. Connel said that if things keep going the way they are, I might be seeing that promotion sooner than I thought.
Well, sometimes talking's over-rated. Don't you think?
Oh, gosh no.
Oh yeah ... Gorgeous.
Oh, Biff. You can "pin" me any time you want to.
What are you doing?
No. What?
Rain.
Still doesn't make it right.
Why am I out of order?
But see that's just the point. It can't stop at once. Because it's in you. And you can't stop something that's in you.
Oh sure it is.
Well, I never had to do it before.
Um ... Outside of Pleasantville.
Oh yeah. A Buick. It's swell.
Well great. The Pleasantville Marathon starts at six thirty.
Weil great. You can watch TV upstairs.
I don't think so.
Just watch. You know why those guys just get cats out of trees? 'Cause nothing burns around here, that's why! They don't need any firemen ...
They don't notice that kind of thing.
David, nobody's happy in a Poodle skirt and a sweater set.  You like all this don't you?
They don't have that kind of potential.
Sure.
What?
I told you. I'm like positive.
Well--it all just keeps going. Roads ... rivers ...
Oh ... Right.
You don't know?
Hunh?
Scout?
That's right.
What the hell's going on!
I don't think we should discuss this until I'm a little bit more composed.
... Hi.
I can't.
What do I MEAN!  You think this is a toy? You think it's your own little goddamn coloring book ...
What?
You're gonna keep painting aren't you?
TV repair?
Yeah ...
What happened?
Cool.
Hey it's me, what are you doing?
Yeah but what are you doing?
You just fucking said "chat," that is so -- what are you now? "chat." I'm just calling to make sure you show up at this party tonight.
Fine. You get back to chatting with your precious customers.
Ok. Thank you.
I'm just stopping by to say hello.
She's my friend and you should meet her. You'd like her.
So it's ok if I bring her.
She's really cute and she's really nice.
....wait a minute: why is this about you now? Why is it always about you?
I'm trying to get you a girlfriend.
I feel really on the spot now.
I don't know.
OH MY GOD. Look at that.
It's not mine.
I have no idea.
....she didn't, I didn't ask her out?
......she forgot her purse at my work and I wanted to get it back to her.
I just want to know where she's staying.
...yeah.....
It's ok that I'm calling, right, I mean? It's ok.
Uhhh...I am sooo tired...I stayed up too late last night, what about you, when did you go to sleep?
Like seven-fifty. Seven hundred fifty?
I thought you had your own business. You said you were gonna diversify and all that stuff....
....what....?
We got disconnected before....
I have to go.
No I'm sorry, now I have to get off the phone....
She is. I think, why did you come here like this?
No.
Yeah.
Hi.
-- well, if you're gonna go --
Sure.
...I thought I should tell you. I didn't want to get too far along on going out and be hiding something --
Yeah.
Yeah.
You were talking about the promotion --
Yeah.
Yeah, no, I see --
I thought you said you bought all that pudding --
Your sister was telling me a pretty funny story about you, when you guys were kids and you were building a ramp for your dog and you threw a hammer through a window? Is that right? You threw a hammer through a sliding glass door?
This is Lena.
Yeah.
Thank you.
Lena?
You don't have a boyfriend or anything do you?
When was the last time you had a girlfriend?
Do you want to meet me and talk about this stuff?
Yeah......yeah.....
This really looks like Hawaii here.
Yeah.
This is nice.
Yeah.
Can I come home with you when we get there?
It's ok to ask that.
If you give me six to eight weeks I can redeem the mileage and then I can with you wherever you have to travel......
If they break or something. What is it, plastic?
It's fine. I can just get you at your office.
You didn't just smash up the bathroom?
You're hand is bleeding.
Why?
Please don't do this to me.
-- and this is confidential?
Hello, my name is Barry Egan and I called your service --
NO. NO. DON'T YOU SAY THAT.
Hi Walter.
And I'm sorry that I did that.
Like a psychiatrist?
You want a number for a psychiatrist, I can get you one, that's not a problem. but what exactly is wrong?
Um....I bought one. I thought maybe it would be nice to get dressed for work, can I show you something?
Hi, Lance.
WHICH?
I have to talk to you in a second about that, Lance, ok?
Yeah.
What?
Is this where you live?
Alright, alright.
Well....what do you want, then?
You can't be late though.
Yes you do. We were calling you Gay Boy and you got so mad....
It's....whatever....that's not cool.
Can we maybe ask for more money on this?
You don't need to talk all macho, "shake him out, little bad boy." Whatever -- you're not an action hero, tough guy, you're not a gangster --
Yeah, no, I have to get something from my car, I said.
You ready?
Should I call you later?
I'm pleased to have the new post, sir.
It's remarkable, Doctor. The patients are so subdued; so docile.
"One day, Fanchon was visited by a surgeon. He ran his fingers across her naked skin, pulling apart folds of flesh, inspecting follicles..."
We can't. All we can do is guard against our own corruption.
His stinking breath caused my eyes to run, that's all.
I've you to look after me, haven't I?
Don't come any closer, Abbe. God's watching.
Mustn't do that, sir.
More than your writing's at stake. The Ministry has threatened us with closure.
You among them?
You always do.
Orvolle. His wine.  From now on, nothing but water at every meal --
A night spent with the partner of my choice.
Coulmier, you animal!
Your words drove Bouchon to --
An innocent child is dead.
Oh, that's rich -- coming from her lapdog --
AND DID YOU?
Was it impotence?
It's a formality; truly.
I'll need an office on the grounds; someplace to store my things.
Playing dress-up with cretins? That sounds like a symptom of madness; not its cure.
Do you favor its publication?
Why? So he'll learn to fear punishment, rather than pursue virtue for its own reward?
A practical man, sir. Given the Marquis' unusual tastes, a sound thrashing on bare flesh may not qualify as a deterrent.
-- then I've friends of my own to visit.
No. It most certainly was not.
That's not our intent --
And my own.
Enough!
A word of caution, Sire: we all remember what happened to Robespierre, Danton and Marat. Put the Marquis to death, and history might even regard you as a despot.
No one can fault Napoleon for merely bringing a man to his senses.
Was ever a man more risquè? He wants to take me every way!
I tremble with fear! You're bound to pound the quivering lips of my Venus mound!
I suppose you want to know about that silly book of yours.
Tortures so arcane, so medieval, even I haven't the words to describe them. If you've an ounce of pity in your heart, you'll throw caution aside, and unlock my door...
I don't believe it!
It's only been described to me. In your books.
Don't be fooled, Madeleine! He fears for himself. He's like a man starving, and you -- ha! -- you're like a pork chop dolloped with heavy cream --
Something to make the angels weep, and the Saints to gasp for air...
Tell him -- if he uncovers our whereabouts -- you'll slit your wrists with a razor, and I'll plunge a hat- pin through my heart.
Oh you do, do you? It is my dearest hope, Doctor, that he remain entombed forever, and that when at last he perishes in the dank bowels of your institution, he be left as carrion for the rodents and the worms.
Oh, but I am!
I'm on the brink of bankruptcy; my husband's resources are all but exhausted. And to what end, I ask you?
....shame on you, truly...
I'd rather read, thank-you.
Not you too
Why don't you come down to LA? Stay with us for a while.
And attractive in a hammy sort of way.
I can't
And he did.
My name is Orson Welles
I'll remember that.
Do you?
Elegant words, sir, when you have made your name and your fortune on slander and innuendo and gossip. In your papers you taught the world how to look under every rock. I learned at the knee of the master.
She's a Catholic. She says it would put her soul in peril. Divorce is a very serious sin, apparently.
You oughta lay off him -- he is the p-p-president, after all.
No, you don't. You want to condemn me, like everyone else. You want to point to the pathetic, old man grown lunatic with his spending -- trapped in his ridiculous
Yes?
Thank you, sir. She begins to leave
Sir, I-
He looked into my face and told me it wasn't about you.
We're using-
No -- no -- I mean--
Oh for God's sake, Louella-
All right! Enough! I've heard this from Schaefer and RKO. I've heard it from everyone--
Telling stories.
Then you better get ready to be the youngest never- was in Hollywood history.
Right-
Like a bug.
I'm not fucking with Hughes. That shit-kicker would kill us dead, baby. Just like Jean Harlow
I don't wanna write about no spic.
The whole joint is half the size of Rhode Island.
Okay, boy wonder, what?
Image the possibilities as this man controls the public perception of the nation through his--
Listen to you. You child! Men like him don't bother with things like legality. They don't have to. You know why, boy-o?   Power.   Power like you couldn't even begin to imagine.
Good?! Good?! Words fail you at last! It's terrific! Now I'll have to do some shaping, of course, and some of the scenes aren't exactly . . . exactly . . .
So they're Jews. . .
Christ.
Kinda.
I been talking to Swanbeck in New York and... Orson, I think they're gonna take it A long pause as Welles looks at Schaefer
Herman.
I, um, need an estimate on some jewelry I might wish to sell. But d-d-discretion is very important to me b-b-because I don't want anyone t-t-to, um, know that--
As I said I have some j-j-j-j-  that I might wish t-t-to sell and I wanted an estimate--
800,000 dollars fully covers the production budget and a little more. Hell, George, you even make a profit on the deal.
Again
CITIZEN KANE There's your title.
Jesus
When Hedda says "I'm coming" you mix a lot of martinis and you pray.
Why don't you just have the guts to admit it
It's just that my movie is so-
No, we're jake. But listen-
Hold on a sec. I got news. We finally found somewhere to premiere KANE but--
The Palace in New York. But Orson there's something else.
Spare me the aria, I know what you want--
Yes! Vibrant and modern and stark like a Picasso sketch drawn to flashes of lightning I We shoot the whole thing in the gallant American West--
Huh? Whadda ya mean, get up?
For what?
Tommy, Jake respects you. He won't even say hello to anybody else -- you know that. But you know when Jake gets set on somethin', Jesus Christ Almighty could get off the fuckin' cross and he ain't gonna talk him out of it. I'm his kid brother. I got no say with Jake on this. He thinks he can buck everybody and make it on his own.
You were a big favorite in this fight. Then two days ago the odds start jumping all over the place until you're a 12-5 underdog.
You were great, Jake. Just like old times. Good thing Sugar Ray wasn't here tonight. Oh Jake, this is State's Attorney Bronson and his wife.
Nothing...
Hit me in the face.
You heard me, I said hit me.
No, I see her around the pool. I know her. I know her like that -- not like that.
You wasn't with her?
You know, like bang her or anything?
I'm the only guy ever to beat Sugar Ray, and I still don't have a shot at the title.
I dunno. Maybe I don't deserve to win. I've done a lot of bad things. I dunno...
You want the title shot or not?
What did Tommy say?
Ain't a cheek ever good enough for you? I never even kissed Mama on the mouth.
I gotta go. I gotta get outta here. I can't take this shit. Lenore is waitin' for me. I gotta go. You're a definite wacko. You're fuckin' crazy, you know that, crazy.
How many pounds I gotta lose?
Are you outa your mind? If I come out, I'll lose the title.
That's all right. He don't mind.
If you let me do it, I'll murder you. Come here.
Come here.
What do you mean, "good looking?"
Who asked you?
No, I'm not.
What did I say?
What's that kissing on the mouth shit?
Do I have to kill you, eh?  Do I have to kill somebody to get an answer?  I know about you at the Copa. I know all about it.
With Salvy, eh?
You did?
I got a lawyer, Jake. We're getting a divorce. I'm getting custody of the kids.
I need ten thousand dollars. My lawyer says if we can spread ten thousand bucks around, we can get the case dropped.
Are you kiddin'? Did you ever see a 14-year-old testify in court? Did you see the papers? "LaMotta on Vice Rap." Everybody likes a shot at the Champ.
Don't make no difference no more.
Hey but Joey, you're thinking nickels and dimes. The money's with your brother.
He ain't doin' the right thing. He's makin' beans compared to what he should be makin'. Can't you make him understand that?
Right, the gym.
That's right, take his part. You're his brother. He's never gonna be champ. Too many people are against him.
From the looks of Davidson's cable, it might even go higher than that. And we haven't even got a camera over there.
Jefferies?
But his leg!
Namely?
Because everything that man's done has been suspicious. Trips at night in the rain, saws, knives, trunks with rope, and a wife that isn't there any more.
Well, officer -- do your duty.
She -- was -- an -- invalid!
I think they missed their chance with her.
Not yet.
What's the matter? Does he have a courtesy card from the police department?
Ever get an answer?
Oh -- I almost forgot!
He has his wife's jewelry hidden in among his clothes over there.
Look Jeff, don't louse up my night with another man killer stuffing a grisly trunk that turns out to be --
Gunnison -- how did you get to be such a big editor -- with such a small memory?
Listen -- if you don't pull me out of this swamp of boredom -- I'll do something drastic.
Gunnison?
That's more like it. Goodnight, old buddy.
Did you get my note?
No.
Well, I only quote from the best.
You've got a hormone deficiency.
How did you know!
I was.
Depends one which one.
It's hard to figure. He went out several time last night, in the rain carrying his sample case.
Sometimes it's worse to stay than it is to run.
Uh-huh.
I'll watch the alleyway -- in case it goes that way.
What?
You can tell that from here?
Got a shovel?
There's no point in taking unnecessary chances.  Give me the phone book, Lisa.
Smart girl.
When those cops get a look at Miss Fremont -- they'll even contribute.
You haven't even heard from him?
Tell him not to waste time calling. To get over here soon as he can. I think Thorwald's pulling out tonight.
He knows.  Don't worry, Tess. It's a man.
Mmmm -- hurts a little.
Empty as a football.
Hasn't been any big demand for tickets.
You mean leave the magazine?
For what?
That's what I'm afraid of.  Could you see me -- driving down to the fashion salon in a jeep -- wearing combat boots and a three day beard? 
Let's not talk any more nonsense, huh?
Not exactly -- but we have a little apartment here that's probably about as popular as yours.  You, of course, remember Miss Torso.
She's not in love with him -- or any of them.
You said it resembled my apartment, didn't you?
He likes the way his wife welcomes him home.
Now, Lisa --
Do you think I consider this recreation?
A lot of things. She's an invalid who needs constant care -- and yet the husband nor anyone else has been in there all day.
Where's the doctor -- the undertakers?
And that's where you're not being clever. He wouldn't parade his crime in front of the open shades.
To get on home.
What about it?
Someone not his wife?
He will. All his things are still piled on the bed.
Do they hide it in their husband's clothes?
Inside stuff?
Don't be too hard on him. He's a steady worker. I wish he'd get there, though.
That's a suitcase?
Jeff -- if anybody walked in here, I don't think they'd believe what they see.
No, Lisa -- I don't think he did.
But you're not?
Lisa -- I -- I -- can't tell you how scared I was that you -- you might --
A new disease.
We got a cookaboo inside.  He wounded some kid earlier.
Hold it, Jim.
You mind if I try?  You have to slam the door in my face?  I try to get to him--what happens?  Don't I give you everything you want?  A bicycle--you get a bicycle. A car--
Yeah!
Yes.
Shoot, Jimbo.
Listen--nobody should make a snap decision--This isn't something you just--we ought to consider all the pros and cons--
Sure.  Sure.
Have some cigars.
He's just loaded, honey.
Did anyone see you there?  I mean did they get your license number or anything?
What's that pounding?
No, honey.  No, he's not here.
Plato.
I don't know.  End up in the electric chair?
In my mother's drawer.
Look--can't you see I'm writing?
I saw it.  Gee, look at that thing swing, will you?  Do you think it never stops?
Shut up.  Are you nuts?
It's wonderful that you understand so well--and so young too!  You know the most wonderful feature about the nursery?
There's only one key.
Hey!  How 'bout that!
You remember that far back?  Boy, I can't even remember yesterday.
Your father!
Friends never break promises, do they?  Okay.  Here.  Now listen.  There are a lot of people outside and they all want you to be safe.  You understand that?  They said I could come in and bring you out.
All right, darling.
It'd stick in my throat, Mom.  I'm nervous or something--
I have to talk to someone, Mom.  I have to talk to you both.  And Dad this time you got to give me an answer.
Just tell a little white lie?
And your folks didn't understand?
But you don't think that's a solution.
Yes, ma'am.
Where what was.
Who lives?
You going there?
I tried to call you before. JUDY I thought so.
Why?
So have I.  But I've never been in love.  Isn't that awful?
I feel as if I'm walking under water.
Hi.
Are you?
So do you.
Yes.  My best friend.
Yes!  I don't know!  I mean maybe he doesn't mean it but he acts like he does.  We're altogether and we're going to celebrate Easter and catch a double bill.  Big deal.  So I put on my new dress and I came out and he--
No.  I don't even know why I do it.
My mother?
You said you'd call my father.
I didn't want to stop.
Gabriel -- !
Gabriel, let him go --
Gabriel!
YES!!!
Didn't have to hit me so fucking hard. Didn't have to throw me outta the goddamn truck.
That's for the hundred bucks worth of pay-per-view.  And that's for the two hundred you took outta your minibar.
I got fifty dollars to spend in your store, Jesus of Nazareth. Can you help me or not?
Yeah.
Well. You're not the first guy I wrote to. But you're the only one I kept writing to.
Had some bad relationships, didn't you.
Can't survive on our bodies alone, Nick.  Hurry up!
Ash, you've gotten me enough --
You got out, Nick. You're here. You're my Christmas.
I'll see what I can do.
Nick, what are you --
You told him about Nick's letters.
You're in on this.
They run routes mostly east, retail stuff, warehouses. But Gabriel knows some guys in New York, Miami, guys he helps get guns to Detroit. Hides 'em with his regular loads.
No. He wants to be working for himself someday.
Nick...
Here and there. Restaurant, uh, that's the main expansion. Tables've been moved around; the big man's office, I dunno, might be upstairs now.
What?
Is there any way you could get into his truck?
We need a gun, Ash. We need a gun...
You shouldn't have.
Who wouldn't.
You said it a million times!
Oh, I know you, Nick. I know you real well.
I was in the joint with him! I knew about him and her, okay!? I took his place!
Yes!
Heyyy. Be nice, convict. We're gonna be working together here.  Get him back in the rig.
A station wagon in Canada.
Why not.
...ttt..tt... two out of three?
What's the code?
Six men means six guns.
Take 'em.
Monster. There never was a structure change. This place was built the same from day one.
Mr. Bangs.
What?
He didn't recognize me. Back off, willya? He didn't recognize me.
You lock down security, you move behind the cage. You hit the Count Room. There'll be a guy in there but he's got no guns; room's accessed by another code. Cashiers'll know it. They'll have alarms.
Where the hell's Gabriel?
Fuckin, Zookerman --
Get to thinking about it, it won't happen.
Not yet.
I'm just talking.
What, working security?
Alamo...
She set them up. All of them.
Talked about the old man's weapons stash, probably forgot I'd remember
I... sorry, Mister...
What? No...
Who the hell made this map.
Since when? What the hell is this room?
Thanks, don't mind if I do.
No. That your head's been up your ass. I walk through the door and Joe says "Vic, you're back, thank god. Finally somebody who knows what the fuck he's doing. Vic, Vic, Vic, Eddie, my son, is a fuck up." And I say "Well, Joe, I coulda told you that." "I'm ruined! He's ruining me! My son, I love him, but he's taking my business and flushing it down the fuckin' toilet! "  I'm not tellin' tales out of school. You tell 'im Joe. Tell 'im yourself.
You ain't dying, he is.
What?
Let Nice Guy set you up at Long Beach. Give ya some cash, get that Scagnetti fuck off your back, and we'll be talking to ya.
We were trying to find out what he knew about the set up.
Pam Grier.
What the fuck was that chick's name? Oh this is just great, I'm totally fuckin' tortured now.
This better not be some Freddy joke.
Something funny that happened to you while you were doing a job.
You two take the manager in the back and make him give you the diamonds. We're there for those stones, period. Since no display cases are being fucked with, no alarms should go off. We're out of there in two minutes, not one second longer. What if the manager won't give up the diamonds?
What? Snap out of it!
Sure.
A guy named Scagnetti. Seymour Scagnetti.
Fuckin' asshole, won't let me leave the halfway house.
What the hell did you expect me to do? Just forget about you?
It's the least I could do Vic. I wish I coulda done more.  Vic. Toothpick Vic. Tell me a story? What're your plans?
It's not about a nice girl who meets a sensitive boy. Now granted that's what "True Blue" is about, no argument about that.
Fuck you, wrong. I'm right! What the fuck do you know about it anyway? You're still listening to Jerry- fucking-Vale.
Jesus Christ, Joe. Fuckin' forget it. This is beneath me. I'm Mr. Pink, let's move on.
I'm gonna do whatever I wanna do with it.
Like hell I am.
Goddamn you, Joe, don't make me do this!
Mr. Pink.
He don't tip.
Nope.
And I'm dying. They don't know that. All they know is they're not to make a move until Joe Cabot shows up. I was sent undercover to get Cabot. You heard 'em, they said he's on his way. Don't pussy out on me now, Marvin. We're just gonna sit here and bleed until Joe Cabot sticks his fuckin' head through that door.
You almost killed me, asshole! If I had any idea what type of guy you were, I never would've agreed to work with you.
It's a surprise.
That's your excuse for going on a kill crazy rampage?
Look, I ordered coffee. Now we've been here a long fuckin' time, and she's only filled my cup three times. When I order coffee, I want it filled six times.
You don't have any idea what you're talking about. These people bust their ass. This is a hard job.
Fuck all that.
Oh this is bad, this is so bad.  Is it bad?
Don't tell me your name, I don't want to know! I sure as hell ain't gonna tell ya mine.
What you're supposed to do is act like a fuckin' professional. A psychopath is not a professional. You can't work with a psychopath, 'cause ya don't know what those sick assholes are gonna do next. I mean, Jesus Christ, how old do you think that black girl was? Twenty, maybe twenty-one?
He ain't dead.
I think he's just passed out.
I told him my first name, and where I'm from.
Oh, I don't doubt is was quite beautiful -
One question: Do they have a sheet on you, where you told him you're from?
That fuckin did it!
You takin' his side?
What are you gonna do about him?
This is what he was doin'.
I'll make you a bet that those same damn niggers who were showin' their ass in public, when their bitches get 'em home, they chill the fuck out.
Like you said, maybe he knows where my ranch is. If he does, he'll be waiting on the porch.
Nobody. The light was bad.
And one of 'em is sick.
Course I can't. I'll give you a lift to the first ranch.
I'm not running a stage line, ma'am, and I can't take a chance on losing the horses.
In the grub box.  Toward morning the dew gets kind of heavy so maybe you better fix up a bed under the wagon. Spread some bunch grass under the tarp and the ground won't be so hard.
Yeah.
I couldn't leave you sitting by the road.
Thanks.
The who?
Go on. Tell me more about her.
That's fine.
Not on this trail, I don't. I've been over it before. Anyway, you ought to be pretty sleepy. Why don't you climb in back.
Why do you think?
I suppose that's my fault.
Then don't come sneakin' around a man's camp.
It wouldn't happen to be this...
Which ranch?
A little hot.
I don't want to run short.
The other fellow wasn't even lookin'.
Things get tough next winter, you'll have somethin' to wear.
I guess I have. You were pretty little when they locked him up. I don't suppose you even remember that time I was gone two months.
That's what I told you then. Only he didn't. Lednov killed him.
I caught up with Lednov in Nogales. He didn't like the idea of comin' back across the border but he came. I turned him over to the sheriff and -- that's the story.
You better start.
I'll eat when I'm good and ready.
You keep your nose out of my life, young fella.
You want to split up? --
Three men on matched roans?
I don't care.
Don't talk -- eat -- we want to get you well quick as we can so we can all get out of here.
No. But it's mine and I didn't want anyone foolin' with it.
Yes, people make me restless.
They went on like I told you.
Thank you, Mr. Graham.
I knew something would happen when they started puttin' up fences and passin' laws.
And we're running out of that.
How many ways can a man say no.
You'd think he'd do it for Elaine's sake, at least...
Go ahead.  Get in training for the pioneer life. I'm finding the nearest body of water and climbing into it.
Stop it --
Mine's gone lame. Take a look at him.
Unicorn -- a kind of animal --
Now I know what a unicorn is, what do we do next?
And you've got me all figured out?
Oh, sure.
I think he wants me.
Oh, I'm fine... just clowning around.
No. I never date outside my race.
I'm sorry, Buddy. You seem really nice, but I'm just getting over a really bad relationship, and I'm not ready to start dating yet.
Sure, that would be cool. Friends.
Wow, she's beautiful. You really think she looks like me?
Hugh Kane.
Huh?
Can you feel that?
No. Keep rubbing.
Now, come on -- you know I'm not ready for that kind of --
Well... okay... but only as a friend.
I know, but I've been thinking --
Oh.
Thanks, I'll be fine.
So, whatever happened to her?
But he'll kill her!
It's the sequel.
Yeah, I broke my fall.
Yes, it was me all along. I killed Hugh Kane and his mistress.
My child, you're alive!
Let's start with some rhythm. Sway back and forth like this.
Yeah, I didn't know what else to do.
I'm going to work in Washington, Cindy.
That's where my best customers are. Marion Berry, George Bush, the Redskins. I'd like to offer you a job, Cindy. Can you type? Take dictation? Swallow balloons filled with cocaine?
I'm glad you asked. It actually makes for a pretty good bedtime story.
Professor, you guys gotta see this. Dwight, come here.
That's fantastic. Our first phenomenon. This is going to be a great weekend. You guys better get some sleep. Dwight and I will take over from here.
There's something going on in this house. I'm not crazy.
Saw who?!
I don't need your help. I'm perfectly capable.
They are the survivors of the Steveston County massacre.
How are we going to get them all up there?
Hey, you're the one who brought up safety. I'm perfectly willing to go in raw.
Yes, I thought that it would be best.
That one.
What is it, Dwight?
Just a little experiment.
Thanks, handyman.
Yeah, but you might wanna light a match before you go in there.  Did you bring my bag?
Because she will lie?
Dog, you look hot.
Shorty, why don't you say grace?
Aww. Cool. Dude.
"Fucked me."
"Fucked me."
Hi, Mrs. Sutphin.
Mom, Mr. Stubbins is a nimrod!
You don't think...
No more violence... No more violence...
Carl can't believe how much I make at swap meets.
He's really cute!
No! Stop it! It's not funny. Mom might do it!  Someone else might die.
Is there a killer loose?
"Serial Mom"?  WOW!
Do you have the musical, "Annie"?
Thanks, Mom.
But Mom, the video's not over.
Oh Mom...
You mean for TV or print?
I can't believe I thought my own mother was a murderess!
I've identified every little birdie we're going to watch tomorrow on the Eastern Shore.
We can be real quiet...
...People who don't mind their own business.
I can't say it out loud. I don't use bad language.
COCKSUCKER! 
I certainly was not!
Marvin A. Pickles.
You'll pay for this, Marvin A. Pickles!  I'm turning your file over to the vice-squad!!  The prosecution rests, your honor.
Misty, if you want to lose weight go ahead, but do it for yourself, not for some boy you barely know.
Always something isn't it?  Can I help you?
I'm not that bad a driver.  Look at her hair!  Turn it off, honey.
I saw one, but it was ridiculously overpriced!
...Browsing.
I didn't want that Faberge egg - it was chipped!
Yes... but... I didn't...
No...  I don't have room in my kitchen...
Right here!
He's a good boy.
His unhealthy obsession with sick horror films.
That's no excuse for a morbid imagination. I caught him drawing this in class last week.  Is there a problem at home?
I didn't hear anything. Got any dessert?
We have mice! I mean it, Ralph! I saw one!
Yes, ma'am, it is.
That's a Franklin Mint piece. Eight dollars.
Okay, Mr. Radeau, it's forgot.
You can?
Can we go there now?
No.
You could go and open the door.
No.
Drink.
You're not a dipsomaniac at your age?
I thought you told me you didn't know where she was.
You come to me with some wild story about her being in danger - naturally I want to know what kind of danger. I want to know where she is.
I know. For the first time I'm beginning to be frightened. I almost feel as if I'd never known my sister.
Yes.
Why?
But you have treated me that way.
Look, Mary, now that I know you better, I think I can be more frank with you. I don't believe you. I still can't understand the reason for such a wild tale. It's like some of Jacqueline's stories.
You don't even know Jacqueline Gibson.
It may make very fine poetry, Mr. Hoag, but it doesn't make good sense.
This is the part of New York I love. It is old. It has memories. If you listen, the houses will speak to you. Walt Whitman...Edna St. Vincent Millay... Eugene O'Neill...in their time they've all lived here.
I'm looking for a party -- a merry party.
Not from me.
I'm afraid.
Why wait?
You will die.
Yes.
But you're always at the library.
Devil worshippers!
It's beautiful -- that searchlight - the stars --
Jacqueline is a murderess she killed a man.
I understand.
I've lost my knack.
I'd like that.
Unless what?
You're even sentimental about it. What made you change your mind?
No, Mrs. Lowood, she doesn't write often.
Difficult? Has anything happened to Jacqueline?
I can quote it fully, Mrs. Redi. "We will avoid violence. For once undertaken, violence becomes its own master and can lead to either good or evil."
Then it is decided. Leo and Durk and I will make our plans.
Are you uncomfortable with my appearance?
I used to take great pleasure in that, being purposefully different, rubbing people's noses in it. Didn't you do that when you were younger?
No, I was in charge of kind of standing at the microphone and reciting these really depressing lyrics in a monotone. The whole thing was really... irrelevant. How do you like being married?
Yes. So you feel security, stability. Like things are going to last awhile.
Exactly. I would say the fact that you feel the first year of your marriage has gone by quickly means lots of things. Or could mean lots of things.
Nine years.
Yes. I was surprised that he accepted when I asked if I could stay here until I found a place.
What's the first?
I feel like they do.
I think so. I remember reading somewhere that men learn to love what they're attracted to, whereas women become more and more attracted to the person they love.
Impotent.
I am self-conscious, but not in the same way that you are. You have got to be the most attractive self- conscious person I've ever seen.
Hah! No, I'm not. Actually, I used to be, but the therapist I had was really ineffectual in helping me deal with my problems. Of course, I lied to him constantly, so I guess I can't hold him totally responsible...
What kind of personal project?
Who's Donna?
Everything about sex.
Like what they've done, what they do, what they don't do, what they want to do but are afraid to ask for, what they won't do even if asked. Anything I can think of.
Maybe you want to go.
I know.
Why not?
I have money.
It won't. Are you ready?
Sometimes. Afterward.
So you have had sex.
So what happened? Was it so bad that it turned you off?
So you lied to her?
And now you can?
Don't you get lonely?
Not yet. I'm not sure I will. I just want out.
I don't know. It all gets back to that Cynthia thing. I don't like her... eagerness. There's nothing left to imagine, there's no...
I'm babbling.
God, I m so mad at him!!
I... I can't answer that precisely.
That's very flattering.
But I don't understand --
No.
I don't know. Possibly.
"Because"? That's not good enough. I asked you a question, Graham. I asked you "how does it feel"? How does it feel, Mr. I Want To Go Down On You But I Can't? Do you know how many people you've sucked into your weird little world? Including me? Come on, how does it feel?
Jesus Christ, Ann. Why is anybody anything? I think you have this idea that people are either all good or all bad, and you don't allow for any gray areas, and that's what most of us consist of.
No, Ann, I can't. I can't forget it. It's not something I can fix. It's difficult. There s something in my mind... the way my brain works...  God, Ann, when you're with another person, and you're... inside them, you're so vulnerable, you're revealing so much... there's no protection. And... somebody could say, or do something to you while you're in this... state of... nakedness. And they could hurt you without even knowing it. In a way that you couldn't even see.  And you would withdraw. To make sure it didn't happen again.
Are you going to see Elizabeth while you're here?
Mmmmm...
Who'd you have lunch with?
I can't tell you how upset I would be if you were lying.
My sister, for one. Is that who it is?
But I'm not.
Why don't I believe you?
Yeah. Jeez, give me some credit.
No, but I wanted to. I really wanted to, partially just to piss you off.
I'm not going to discuss this with you anymore. You're making no sense.
Yes.
Not very often.
Yes.
Don't you think that's a lot of garbage? I'd really like to know where it's all going to go.
Well, this weekend John was taking out the garbage, and he kept spilling things out of the container, and I started imagining a container that grew garbage, like it just kept filling up and overflowing all by itself, and how could you stop that if it started happening?
I've been thinking about it for awhile, and then I was talking to somebody who kind of put things in perspective for me.
I know, but this... I just feel like everybody I know right now is obsessed with sex.
You know what. You say it just to irritate me.
Well, he doesn't strike me as the kind of person that would go in for that sort of thing, anyway.
Oh, for God's sake. Really, Cynthia, really, I don't think he's your type.
I have a pretty good idea.
Well, why?
Well, what? Is he dangerous?
Cynthia!
Why did you do that?
You know what I mean, you don't even know him!
You are in serious trouble.
What is it?
Nope.
Nope.
Well, I don't really listen to her when it comes to men. I mean, look at John, for crissake. Oh, you went to school with him didn't you? You're probably friends or something.
Why don't you let me tape you?
Talking.
Yes.
Whichever you prefer.
Just a moment.
My first sexual experience or the first time I had intercourse?
No. If anything, after I looked at it awhile, it got more interesting. It had character, you know?
He said that my hand felt good.
Hi.
But I want you to do it, I want somebody who will ask the right questions and everything, somebody I can play to and feel safe because you can't do anything.
So make an exception.
I only get one today? Gee, how exciting.
I did.
You're intrigued?
You know what I mean.
Cynthia. John.
She's there? What's she doing there?
What's so stupid about it?
I wish you hadn't done that.
Look, are we going to do it or not?
I can't believe I let him stay in my house. Right under my nose. That deviant fucker was right under my nose and I didn't see him.
Maybe I don't want to leave. Maybe I want to talk.
No.  You said three-fifty?
What do you mean?
I like having the car, the car is important.
I need help? Whose sitting by himself in a room choking his chauncey to a bunch of videotapes, Graham? Not me, buddy. You're the fucking nut. Now show me those tapes.
Goddamit...
You're hesitating. I think that means you have.
Yeah.
He hates doctors. Doctors and lawyers. He never goes to doctors.
Buy 'em with what, dumbhead?
Let's get outta here before somebody hears us!
Far as I know, yeah, that was her.
That's great, Forsythe, great. Thanks.
C'mon, Forsythe. Are there any more on the list?
Meeting Rollo at Tudor's. Might take a while.
A man... I think I recognized him... a man who lives here. He just...  ...he just attacked me for no reason at all. I just opened the door... I was making supper for you, and he grabbed me, he tried to kiss me...
Was this girl from Starliner Towers?
You touch my spleen, Rollo.  And here all the time I was thinking -- if I ever bothered to think about the good old days -- well, at least there's Rollo. He's in VD and he's happy.
Well, at least you still talk the same.
Did I say anything?
It's crazy.
You oughta be careful yourself. Might end up cutting your throat.
OK, Rog. See you at ten.
BREAKING OUT
Of course.
After breakfast.  You're sounding tense, Janet.  Maybe I could give you a little massage?
Everyone loves the girl next door, particularly Farley.
No it wasn't Janet -- exactly -- It was, in fact, your new sponsor.
Delighted, Betty -- That is if you don't mind being seen with an older man.
Bert brought them over from Europe.  They had a very popular series together.  It's still rerun in a lot of countries.  You must have seen them in 'Dentonvale?'
Ah yes.  Farley Flavors.  You know, I find it...
...closed?
Now Betty, don't overreact.
Yes, Betty.
It pays to know your way around, Oliver.
Oh I adore Coleridge Taylor.  As a matter of fact...
Yes.  Macabre, isn't it.  The blind leading the blind.
Indulge?
No!  I don't know what Janet's next move will be...but you can be sure of one thing...it all starts here!
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR THE MONEY
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR THEIR LOVERS
TENDERNESS AND INNOCENCE IN DENTON`
He moved all right!  When they found him with fifteen other naked men at the back of Wilson's Bakery.
Sure thing.
Who?
Thank God he was born an orphan. It would have killed his parents.
You're practically naked!
Do you really think so?
Of course.  He was in great danger of harming himself.
I'm sick of hearing about that lame dog.  I've got a lot going for me.  I'm going places.  I'm going to be someone.  I'm gonna win my way into the lives and hearts of people even if I have to kill to do it.  I'll make the pathetic little crumbs love me. I don't even know why I'm wasting my time here with you.  I should be with my people...
Farley!
Fast!
And you can 'peep in' on Brad in the morning.
YOU'RE NO GOOD
CRIMINAL
In the old series we didn't have a convertible.
No.
I'm a bad girl. I'm a bad girl.
I liked it when you caught me fucking him.
Good, good. Drinking some good wines and kicking back, you know. So what's happening? Still no word?
And?
Huh.
What are you pouring tonight?
Stephanie.
In Santa Ynez.  And I agree with you about Cab Franc.
You said you loved me! You fuck! I hope you die!
Maybe. Recognize this?
No, we're paying for the wine.
Well, in that case...
I can't help the traffic.
Okay, there was a tasting last night. But I wanted to get us some stuff for the ride up. Check out the box.
Yeah, Conundrum.
You know how long I've been begging to take you on the wine tour. I was beginning to think it was never going to happen.
Oh yeah. Much better.
I thought we could just say a quick hello to my mother.
Um... seventy... something.
As if she'd even be attracted to guys like us in the first place.
Whatever's closest, man. I need a glass.
Good, yeah, it is a rose. Only this one is rather atypically made from 100% Pinot Noir.
What color is it supposed to be?
Now set your glass down and get some air into it.
Uh-huh.
Pour us a couple.
It's going to be great. Here's to us.
You know that chick?
You don't know anything about this woman. Calm down. Let's just eat, okay?  The duck is excellent and pairs nicely with the Highliner Pinot.
Jack, she's a fucking waitress in Buellton. How would that ever work?
Well, I'm tired. Aren't you tired?
Now I've got another lie to live down. Thanks, Jack.
Miles, I gotta tell you something. Victoria's coming to the wedding.
I want to go home now.
With Maya?
We were supposed to play golf.
Okay! Jesus!
What?
And what about Stephanie? She's a woman -- with a kid. A single mom. What do you think she's looking for? Huh?
She's working. I need a break anyway. She's getting a little clingy.  This is our day!
Thanks, Jack.
Slaughterhouse.
He wrote a great one on Burgundy, and I used to get his newsletter, but then there were doubts about whether he does all his own tasting. Plus a couple of times he declared certain years vintages of the century, and they turned out to be turkeys. Fucker never retracted.
Put me down, Jack.
No.
Just stop, okay? Make something up, and that's what happened. Whatever you want. Write my confession, and I'll sign it. Just stop pushing me all the time! I can't take it! You're an infant! This is all a big party for you, but not for me! This is serious. And you -- Just... leave me alone, okay? You're fucking me up.
I don't have to.
What's up?
Thanks.
Neither could I. I think it's Bukowski.
You told him. I'm fucking hurting here.
Gonna fuck that up too. I should sue her ass. Only reason I won't is to protect Christine.
Huh. Let me think.
Looks like you were in a bad car accident.
No way. No way.
Forget it. Your wallet was stolen at a bar. Happens every day.
Hold on.
I'm fine. You rest.
I'll pay for it.
I don't know. Doesn't look like anybody got hurt in this one.
Back at you.
Oh, no, actually. Busy night.
I know. I love that.
Not much of a collection really. I haven't had the wallet for that, so I sort of live bottle to bottle. But I've got a couple things I'm saving. I guess the star would be a 1961 Cheval Blanc.
Yeah, I know.
I think they overdid it a bit. Too much alcohol. Overwhelms the fruit.
She's with her grandmother. She's with Steph's mom. She spends a lot of time over there. Steph's... well, she's Stephanie.
Yeah, I know. It's kind of weird. Out of context.
Yeah. Definitely.
"The Day After Yesterday."
Um... yeah but it's more...
Like what a fraud he was.
Oh, yeah. No. I mean yeah, I stopped by for a drink. Didn't see you.
Okay.
Of course I was. I mean, just now I could have made up some story, but I didn't. I told you the truth.
Don't touch me. Just take me home.
And I haven't been with anyone since my divorce. This has been a big deal for me, Maya -- hanging out with you, and last night. I really like you, Maya. And I'm not Jack. I'm just his... his freshman roommate from San Diego State.
Miles, don't call me when you're drunk.
I'm going to hang up now, Miles.
So how're you doing?
I guess.
See you over there, Miles.
About four weeks.
This is a tasting, sir. Not a bar.
Exactement!
He had to make a phone call.
Huh. Jack loves golf. Crazy about it.
Where?
Bye, Stephanie. Bye, Siena, Caryl.
Just now. She's thrilled. And the kids.
Does she ever answer back?
I heard them Morgan.
Hi baby.
I'm here.
I've had two separate folks tell me they think there are strangers around these parts the last couple of nights. Can't tell what they look like, cause they're staying in the shadows -- covert like. No one's got hurt mind you... And that's the give away.
Just make noises then.
Yes, it was.
It's broken Morgan. It'll just keep doing this.  Let's get out of the car okay?
That wasn't the answer you wanted?
What's furry, furry rabbit?
What time is it?
Did they say what our chances would be if they did invade?
What are you doing?
I'm sorry I hurt your arm.
I'm looking!
Graham.
That means they're unemployed.
I just asked his name.
You're scaring your sister.
There are none.
What was the first thing?
He definitely wasn't a midget.
Edgar, it sounds as strange to me saying it, as it is to you hearing it. But we couldn't see him. He stayed mostly in the shadows. All we could make out was movement.  But I'll tell you something with absolute certainty. There was someone watching our house last night. He was looking in my children's windows and I want you to find him Edgar.  I need you to take this seriously, just in case, it is something serious.
Do you owe anybody money? You can tell me off the record if you need too.
He wasn't drinking. Ray fell asleep at the wheel.
Yeah.
Don't worry.
Wait a minute! If you don't believe me, ask them...  ...they saw me and my pal in Turley before we did the job.
What do you mean, the horses?
You're in here for winging a guy?
Someplace safe. How you feeling?
I didn't just come along. I was looking for you.  Jake said you were out there. I saw him in town, and he told me about that business the other night. Said you boys took a Henry off one of McKendrick's men. I wanted to see it.
I'm sorry.
You'll never make it.
I already did that.
That I do.
I'm afraid it is a bad start, friend, 'cause my name isn't Baxter, and he ain't Hawley.
Where's the pinto going?
It's a town...
I expect.
I understand.
I'll be around.
I'm going to California with my brother.
Last one to the Midnight Star buys.
Whose law? The law here runs a man down -- just like these cattle.
We got married just before this trip, so we could come out here and try the land. It's hard to find a man willing to take on a life like that.
And a pretty lady.
His son is worse than he was. He's smoother, so you don't always hear him coming, but he'll do anything to keep his range free.
Is there a place in town that takes... my kind?
This nigger's breaking up my place, Sheriff Langston.
You're kidding.
I was afraid of that.
Oh that's just fine. Where were you when Ma and Daddy needed you? It's too late, Mal. Now you finally show up and all you can think of is to get yourself killed.
It's none of your business.
I don't have any family any more.
Because you're my sister. There's nobody else.  The men who killed Daddy are after Jake. I gotta talk to him.
I heard that too.
Well I'm real happy for you, Cobb. But I think I'll keep looking for mine.
Maybe we ought to ask Stella.
This is a lot of money.
We didn't talk about this.  They took the little boy, Cobb.
Thanks. That's what I call it too.
So-called?
That's the good stuff.
If he didn't you'd never sit still while this was happening.
Nah!  What's he got? This is a nice saloon, but there are other nice saloons. It's not the money. Not for you. Why can't I get ahold of it?  Cobb says there's no telling what you're going to care about.
You better get in there with her until this thing is over.
No!!  I can prove it to you.  I'll take you to her.
Damn --  Yes -- I --  -- I'm just a little tired. Listen, Elaine, Viktor and I -- it's strictly a working relationship.  We could never be anything else.  We're just so... different.
I don't know how many times I have to say this, Elaine, but Viktor and I are not in love.  I only make love to the camera.
Okay -- for you.
Hmm... Mike and Ike's.
You can have everything -- office, car, assistants -- all I want is the picture.
I don't know if that's going to happen.
Out of the question.  A circus like that?
She's my actor.  There are other studios, Elaine.  There's only one Simone.  Leave the press conference to me.
No problem.  Do you want to come in?
"Forever".
If it's on the page...
She'll do her own.  Theater training.
Thank you.  What did you think, Lainey?
Thank you.  I'll tell Simone you liked it.
Everyone you know is lying.
You're so good to protect her like this.
She said you were very beautiful.
No, of course not!  Why?  Would you care if we were?
I do?
Excuse me?  Start?
I would rather have you than Simone.  Believe me.
No, there isn't.  There's nothing to her.
Not if I don't let her.
Hello, is this Elaine?
Why?
Of course.
Do what you do to Simone.
What exactly was it that attracted you to your first two projects?
And what may I ask brought this on?
It was more in passing.
I know what you mean.
Simone!
That's the point, Hank.  No matter how good they are, they're still Mickey Mouse.  Everyone's tried. Everyone's failed.  It can't be done.
I'm already dead.
It's really... not anything, Lainey.  It's just --
I know plenty of boys.
If anyone asks about Simone --
Precisely.
Night, Lainey.
Dinner?  Dinner's difficult.  A phone call?
I could get the death penalty.
Our leaders aren't presidents anymore -- they're pop stars and screen idols.  If Woodward and Bernstein were alive today, they'd be right here in Hollywood with me.
Maybe the reason she's with me is a little thing called integrity, Sayer.  Look it up.
I'm just trying to help you, Sayer. I don't want you to be disappointed.  It gets cold out here at night.
I don't have time for this, Sayer.
Abduction?
Er,... good.
She looks a lot like you.
Dark?
Obviously the name isn't real -- she's using an assumed identity, travels under a false name, checks into hotels with an alias.  She never stays in the same place two nights in a row.  Anything on the satellite photos?  What about the fingerprints?  What happened when we dusted that hotel suite?
What do you want -- ?
Yes, I'd like that.
-- What you don't understand --
Buy it?  They're paying for it. And around here that's how you really know they buy it.
You're right.  You're right.  Of course, one doesn't want to boast. It's a classic case of technology in search of an artist.  That's all you've been waiting for, an artist with integrity, with a vision, who can see.
You know what I'm talking about.
We can keep it in the bathroom.
--Do I know you?
I didn't leave you.
Congratulations.
How do you draw now?
Look over there.
You hate him?
What about Mrs. Marschal?
Something I want?
You haven't told bedtime stories before?
Your eyes told me.
Me too.
No, walking around, like regular people... They can't see each other. Some of them don't know they're dead.
Someone else can help you. Someone else can make you happy.
I don't think that's the way it works, Cole.
Maybe.
Lots of things.
Yes.
...I don't know.
I know.
Cole, please stop.
They used to hang people here.
You talked funny when you went to school here. You talked funny all the way to high school!
Who!
Chuck E. who?
What are you talking about?
Oh yeah? Why's that?
Nikes? What-the-hail you talkin' about?
Bitch.
Which street corner?
Yeah. To get the hell off this farm.
Find out what's holding things up. I want to get the hell off this farm.
No shit.
Bus broke down.
Two hundred bucks?? Are you crazy?
Shotgun. Suicide. Next?
Nah. We still got Billy Bob.
Manure... is life.
Come out, come out wherever you are!
Depends. You got some nerve intruding on a man's grief. I bet I could pull this trigger right now and call it justifiable homicide. Now: who are you?
Joseph Macdonald. Damn right, boy. And don't you forget it.
Broke her heart you never visited... But I always said you'd come back.
This is his room... isn't it?
People say he was a murderer.
Amen.
Yeah. Sure. I'm screwing up the song. You're the one who's been two beats behind since we kicked it off.
Yeah, that's right! I'm outta here -- Y'all can kiss my city ass goodbye!... I'm gone with the wind.
Yeah?
Then why go back now?
This... used to be Jethro's room. The attic.
I... heard something... came in here last night. Must have gone to sleep.
Billy Bob's dead. -- We were wrong -- he didn't do anything. I-It's the scarecrow --
HE'S STILL OUT THERE!!!
Can't help it, Suze... family sticks together...
I was getting 'warmed' up.
Spider.
Who knows? Just like a man... never around when you need them.
What'll we do?
Sherry, you gonna create a hysteria?
Touch some deer feces out in the forest. Eat a sandwich without washing your hands. Then you got lyme disease.
I'll tell you what, no one with lyme disease gonna win any damn handsome contests!
Why? Listen, it doesn't matter. I gotta go.
I know what people say, Bill. I... Remember, back in high school I worked at my father's gas station?
When you wanted to run away, I called your dad.
And this is mine.
Shelby!
Listen, you got any reports of... I don't know what you call 'em. They look like big slugs, only fast.
Sorry.
Took the kids to his Mom's for the weekend.
What?
That's disrespectful.
It's just one of my students, Grant.
No! No. Heh. I'll be right back.
Grant, no!
What other stuff?
'Praise Jesus?' That's fucking pushing it, Margaret.
Yeah, well I kinda figured that.
What's the matter? Legend has it Bandit LaRue's king of the road.
You know how rumors start.
You paying for the gas?
Absolutely not. In fact, I picked up a bride yesterday; except she was a singer.
Yeah, I do. Especially from that angle.
Mattoon, Illinois. But I moved down south to work in the Civil Rights movement.
Would I lie to you?
Shoot.
You know, you're not a bad passenger.
I don't know. Maybe Jerry Jeff sent the heat after us.
We lost him.
Enough to get to Jersey. I'll walk the rest of the way. I've been sitting a long time.  Nice meeting you. It's been a trip.
Trucker coffee. It's three times stronger. Good for a hundred miles. That, a coupla perks, and you can leap tall buildings in a single bound.
Yeah.
You plan on driving trucks all your life?
Ummm?
Forget it. This is one of the longest relationships I've ever had. I'm not blowing it now.
And?
That man is your father?!?
See ya, Kate.
Hot Pants, please. I'm gonna be flying by in about five minutes with Smokey on my tail. Can you lock it off behind me?
Yes.
I want you to know I'm doing this against my better instincts.
I'll do it.
Nothing on 'em and two cups of mud; one while I'm waiting.
Yeah, I can tell he's gonna be a major asset.
And if we don't, they're gonna be riding high in a brand new Kenworth.
If you ask me, I think we should make that run to Choo Choo Town and pick up that load of lumber. Nice. Easy. And within the law.
But I still don't think...
Go.
Six. Got it.
This is Bandit I, come back.
What's your twenty?
Not for long, you ain't.
On its way. Give me a coupla minutes, okay?
What's your twenty?
Then don't.
It's gonna be close. Real close.
We're gonna have to do a little tightrope act.
You're about to hit a convoy. Tighten up your rubber band. The oncoming's clear.
What's that, pardner?
Ticking away, but it looks like a clear shot to Hot Town. Green lights and white lines all the way.
Pick it up, Breaker.
What's up, Dixie Chicken?
You pass that funky Cobra on the highway?
Where the hell are you?
I'll keep my eyeballs peeled.
Yes, ma'am.
If that sumbitch was in the race, he'd be in the winner's circle by now.
Then it must be a helluva idea.
That's the point, Dickey.
Congratulations. You just became a legend maker.
-- Yeah, I heard. But they won't hold him for long. Anyway, he sure gave them sumbitches a run for their money.
And everybody, all the time. Yeah, it's a chore.
What kind of personnel?
No rest for the wicked.  Why were we never shown these files? We're sitting on Sparazza for what? Six months now and we're just seeing this?  Did you know that he's has had thirty- six major medical procedures performed on him since 1953?  Elective plastic surgery, every single one --
All of 'em. His entire entourage. I think we should move.
Wait a minute, what other agent?  What other agent?
Yeah.
And threw us into the lake.
I'm not doing cocaine.
-- Fine, fuck, I got it... Lake Tahoe, Nevada. I'll have Hugo book your flight, you can be here in a couple hours. He'll meet you at the airport.
That's already happened hoss. It's naive to think otherwise.
Are you a fucking colossal idiot?
I dunno what to say to you sweetheart, it is what it is.
-- this isn't a swap meet Morrey, they're getting Sparazza and the west coast syndicate, giftwrapped, now if that's not good enough --
I thought Heller was a double op?
-- will be handled back in --
The same year that Sparazza murdered Agent Freeman Heller...
Primo Sparazza was Heller's alias. He went deep cover in 1940 and stayed under for over ten years, amassing materials against the mafia and other criminal syndicates. He may have ripped the organization wide open, pre-Appalachia, but his superiors were convinced that he had gone rogue, swapped allegiances...So they gave the order to terminate his cover.
-- okay, g'head --
Fuckin' A, first survive, yes?
That's the punchline, y'ready?
Good. This thing's on track, looks like it's gonna get done.
Okay, well, y'know, then we just gotta get Israel.
You know I did baby...  And a deep, dark one at that. Now if you ain't a dog, which you don't look like --
-- good, then all you got to be is grateful.
Got hit twice.
'Cuz we don't need to draw any more shit down on our heads. We hit whoever's between us and Israel. I don't want to dead the whole floor and I don't want to be killing women no matter how they make a living.
-- I thought we had secure frequency. Aww girl, tell me this mafucka ain't goin' off right now.
He said that the shit could get hot, could get heavy... I said good.  'Cuz I got two of the hottest, heaviest bitches alive.
What's the time frame?
Leave the light off.
What do you want?
You're not Gibarian...
All right.
We're done.  Oh, I should tell you, I don't trust Snow.  There's something wrong with him.
Why did you agree to come here?
Kelvin, she begged me.  I had a short- range version of the destabilizer prototype, a miniature with a range of a few meters.  She walked into it and disappeared.  She was gone.
No, she won't.
Whose side are you on?
He's dead.
What?
Oh, that's a relief.
Will she come back?
Gibarian said he thinks Solaris should be destroyed.
No.
Human beings can die.
She drank liquid oxygen.
Just get him to stop.
I'll go with you.
Why?
I'll be right back.
Rheya.  Not here.
Yes.  But not until you mentioned them.  As soon as you said those things, I remembered them.  And they have associations that make me think of other things I remember.  It's like filling up.
You were trying to break down the door.  Do you know why?
I been thinking about how much I hate you.
How old were you?
Well.  He doesn't think it's God, but for different reasons than me. He's thinking: If I can figure out how to make it stop, than I am smarter than it is, and therefore it cannot be God.
I'm just trying to understand what's going on.
Yes.  Especially toward the end.
How can I tell?  You've seen both of me.  I only know what you're like here.  You're all I know.  There is no "You" from before.
You're lying.  I'm not human.
I never said I didn't.
You exist here.  I keep telling you.
Yes.  I told you.  It was exactly like mine.
I can't --
It's an experiment.
Gibarian was helpless.  It's very simple: Man created the science that resulted in the discovery of Solaris, and the ship that brought us here.
You didn't like him?
You still writing the occasional magazine article?
It's okay... I've never been a detective before either...
Can we go then?
Beg pardon?
Yeah.
Sooner, the better.
How did you know?
No kidding.
I'll miss you, Mike...
I don't know.
Oh, I do want to know.  I tried to reach you at the precinct.
Oh that thing in Queens.
Pretty far.  I'm told not to say anything about it on the phone, in case it's tapped... they think it's best, safer, if I go away, at least till Venza's found.
No really, it's okay, I've gotta go. I'm expecting some calls.  I'll be fine, really.
I know.
... Don't explain.
I don't know...
You have a weakness for Lady Cops.
It was something my father always liked me to do.
Just putting in an appearance then.
Absolutely.
I'm all right.
Amen to that.  The supermarket's full of assholes.
I think television's a dangerous thing.
I don't know that Ellie.  He might get out.  Garber's not bein' straight with the witness, she could be in deep shit if she identifies him, and it's my job to convince her she won't be.
I think -- she's crazy.
She didn't like the other one, so she picked this one.
I'll be right up.
Goddamn Venza assaulted a taxi driver in the Bronx, thirteen months ago.  It's coming to court and the judge let him walk because of the pending case law.
Take it easy!  I set her up.  I saw it coming.
It is my fault!  I'm responsible for her!
I want you and Tommy to stay with my mother.
I'm sorry.
I heard.
Do it, or look for another profession.  That's a choice I guess.
Be happy.  He's good at this.
Ever shot anyone?
Does it make you... hard?
She's not a suspect, sir, she's a witness.  Could I ask you to step outside, please.
That's right, you're gonna do what I say.  Joey.  I want to help you out of this.
She trusts me.  She'll do what I say.
Koontz!  Let her come in!  Claire! It's pitch dark in here!  You're gonna have trouble seeing anything, so just come in, and straight down a long hall.  Then stand at the door so we can see you. We want to see your face and we won't be able to until you get to the kitchen door!
I know where everything is.
She's taking singing lessons.
We're gonna pass the street.
No, I'm not coming in.  And if you'd rather go to a "singing lesson" than have dinner with your father...
At least this ensemble doesn't glow in the dark.
No. No, that's okay.
You stop him?
No…not really.
Remember Little League?
Oh, sure.
No, no.
See?
I saw him too.  He was silly and obnoxious.
Let me guess.  The hunting dogs. You lost your scholarship.
Why home? The real world beckons, man!  The possibilities are endless.  Want to go up to the World Trade Center and laugh at New Jersey?
Don't be pitiful.
Listen, I do appreciate your concern, but--
Oh, look, Mr. Hogan, I'm really sorry about what happened in there. Really--
I think you're trying to tell me something.
Parker-- you go here, right?  Got your camera?
Seventy.  But I want blood and gore.  You know, sexy stuff.
Double-exposures? But they're not-- I was in--
Frmpph-yrr.
Two suits by tomorrow for $400?
Deal.  But don't tell anyone.  I want to keep a low profile.
Just call me Spidey.
Just about.  You see, I also have this amazing strength...
When Peter was little, he loved to hide.  In closets, under the sink. He needed a secret place.  But when I'd look for him, he'd laugh... he wanted to be found.
I-- uh--
I lov-loathe Elizabeth Allan. Abhor, detest, despise--
I hate your relatives, I hate your coffee, I hate your shoes.
Poor Harry.  Always desperate for attention.  What about the bunny?
This from a girl who still plays with dolls.
You're not trained for that.  None of us are... I mean, sometimes I...  Okay, let's say you had gone back. What then?  Are you bulletproof?
Oh, God, I forgot to--
Nah.
I know him.
Einstein, right?  We'll see ya.
Any sign of our friend?
Your records are older than you are.  Have you never heard of new wave?
It'll shut itself off.
See?  You big dullard.
I mean, I suddenly have immense physical power, and the ability to crawl up walls--
All right, we may be insignificant, imperfect creatures-- but we're all we've got.
No, thank you.  I'm sure you've got your own problems.
I'll try. Thanks.
I was hoping you'd call, babe. Look, you got representation?
I just gave-- yeah, sure.
And blow up the universe just to prove he's right?  Bit egotistical, isn't it?
Bonkers.
I'm not so happy myself.
Sure, in the war.  Pull those cables--
Don't worry. He'll be all right.
Looks good outside.
That'll do.
In this barracks?
Who is it?
No crack. Two packs of cigarettes say they don't get out of the forest.
You stink, Sefton!
You're all wire happy, boys. You've been in this camp too long. You put two and two together and it comes out four. Only it ain't four.
Why not?
How much more do we have to take from him?
Only he ain't quite finished yet. Blondie -- get that smudge pot. Tie it to Steve's leg.
Everybody but Joey, and you know who.
My legs are frozen.
Sefton!
What are the chances busting out of here?
That is correct.  Lieutenant Dunbar, I came to apologize for the accommodations. Ordinarily, of course, we never put officers up with enlisted men.
I didn't do it -- I didn't do it.
I want to sleep... I haven't slept for three days.
What exactly is he charged with?
Some are not bad at all.
Droppen Sie dead!  Raus mit dem Ofen. Los! Los!
Why do you do this to me every morning?
I'm telling you, Animal -- these Nazis ain't Ko --
I don't care if they wear galoshes!
Me? What if she don't want me?
He don't have to worry. He'll trade the Krauts for a six-burner gas range. Maybe a deep freeze too.
It's not good for you, Animal.
This is a good one!  Shut up, everybody! Listen to this!  'The President of the United States to Harry Shapiro. Greeting: Having submitted yourself to a local board, you are hereby notified to report...' What do you know! So now I'm a draft evader!
Hey, here's Esther Williams.
I'll open mine, too.
There's a time in every man's life when he wants to be alone! So go away!
Anything else?
Take some men and get the antenna going. Let's see if we can catch the BBC.
Good.
I still say this is my tag. Any objections, Hoffy?
Lay off, Schulz. He's got a sickness. He's krank.
Yeah? How would you like to see the guts of nine pals splattered all over your plane?  C'mon Joey -- don't be afraid.
One more thing, gentlemen. The Kommandant told me to pick up the radio.
A little weak today.
I'll say it is. You spilled a little borscht on it.
Sure I heard it. I still got one good ear.
So who stays with me? Maybe Joey? No -- not Joey. Wouldn't you feel safer with Security on the job?
That's right. Or would you rather see Dunbar lying out there in the mud tomorrow morning like Manfredi and Johnson?
Nothing for Kuzawa?
Just what makes you so popular?
Where. Up Joey's ocarina. Didn't you know?
Maybe just one word? Kaput? Because you're kaput, Price.
Six o'clock in Berlin. They were having lunch in Cleveland.  Am I boring you, boys?
Ganz einfach... Streichhoelzer... und eine Zigarette...
How would you like to give Frau Schulz a pair of silk stockings for Christmas?
Who's the guy, Schulz?
Not particularly.
Just don't drool on it.
We'll consider it a prisoner exchange.
Where is he?
He is.
I don't want to hear anymore about it. I'm not going, and that's final.
Sorry, Captain. The ribbon has already entered the galaxy. It will pass through this sector in approximately thirty-one hours.
The star's destruction has had numerous astro-physical effects within this sector. However, none of them appear to have a connection to the energy ribbon.
But I did not deal with it, sir. I let it prevent me from helping my friend.  Does that make me a coward?
Yes, sir. There are two in the Veridian system.
I believe the beverage has provoked an emotional response.
During the Farpoint mission. We were on the Bridge and you told a joke. That was the punchline.
It appears to be a magnetically sealed.
I believe the emotional chip has overloaded my positronic relays.
All hands, brace for impact!
I'll go. You have the Bridge.
Your "sixth sense"- I've always wondered where it came from.  And what about Soran?
You're in the Nexus.
For you. This is where you wanted to be.
Wherever he wanted to be.
Yes, where would you go?
What makes you think things will be any different this time?
I'm from what you would consider the future; the 24th-century.
She's not real either, is she? Nothing here is. Nothing here matters.
That's right.
Did we do it? Did we make a difference?
Least I could do for a captain of the Enterprise.
What do you mean, you're not going? We promised.
I thought you might.
What's normal?
What do you want?
I was ordered to by the Captain.
Bad food, brutal discipline.  No women.
No. Thank you.
Too big. How long until the ribbon arrives?
You may still. Somehow I doubt this will be the last ship to carry the name Enterprise.
What if I told you I found a new truth?
Aye, sir.
The star's going to collapse in a matter of minutes.
Soon, Captain... Quite soon.  
Message acknowledged. All units will be informed.
Mr. Scott, we need everything you've got now.
Sir, Starfleet calling Grissom again. A warning about us.
Aye, sir.
Keep trying, Chekov. At regular intervals.
Bones... Can you give me a quadrant bi-scan?
What did you see, Chekov?
Locate.
Oh no you don't! Regulations specifically state: "nothing shall be beamed aboard until danger of contamination has been eliminated." Can you guarantee that?
A photon tube...!
I'll handle that later.
We're not here to investigate geological aging, we're here to find life forms!
But... How could they have evolved so quickly...?
Logic indicates that is the case.
I used protomatter in the Genesis matrix.
It was the only way to solve certain problems --
I'll try to remember that, Captain.
I know, but -- let's do it by the book. Stand by on this channel.  Go.
Mr. Scott. Have you always multiplied your repair estimates by a factor of four?
Thank you, Mr. Scott. I'll try not to take that personally.  My friends... I can't ask you to go any further. Dr. McCoy and I have to do this. The rest of you do not.
Aye, sir!
Oh, God, sir, I dinna think so...
Just him, sir!
Only one thing, Sir... Get him off this planet... His aging is part of what's going on around us...
Very well.  Mr. Chekov, I need pre-approach scan... Take the science station, please.
I'll need it, Sulu.
FULL IMPULSE POWER!
Aye, sir, Warp Speed...
What about surface life signs...?
Come on!
Saavik. Send to Ambassador Sarek. Tell him we're coming in.
It's been a while, sir. Here we go... Retrothrusters!
My friends, the great experiment: Excelsior, ready for trial runs...
Genesis?! Whatever for?
Jim, in your absence, Genesis has become a galactic controversy... Until the Federation Council makes policy, you are all under orders not to discuss with anyone your knowledge of Genesis... Consider it a quarantined planet. And a forbidden subject.
Then I'll find a ship -- I'll hire a ship.
Then let me speak to the Council! Harry, <U>please</U>! I can <U>make</U> them understand!!
Because he asked you to! He entrusted you with his very essence -- with everything was not of the body. He asked you to bring him to us -- and to bring that which he gave you: his Katra. His living spirit.
Kirk, I must have your thoughts. May I join your mind?
Yes...
... No...! ` Kirk, bathed with sweat, suddenly shudders in pain. Sarek opens his eyes, removes his hands. He touches Kirk with gentleness as Jim recovers, opens his eyes.
But he couldn't touch me...! We were separated!
Yes... But -- how...?
But at what cost? Your ship... Your son.
Great power... to control... dominate... destroy. If it works.
Success, my lord.
Yes, my lord!
Wait!... Wait...
Killing his son was <U>stupid</U>! It made Kirk willing to die.
They are useless! It was Kirk I needed. And I let him slip away.
You know what they say, Lieutenant. Careful what you wish for: you may get it.
But, as you are so fond of observing, Doctor, I'm not human.
I'm afraid I can't stop to discuss this logically --
More antiques for your collection -- Cheers!
For your eyes. For most patients of your age, I generally administer Retlax Five to restore flexibility of the lens.
Exactly. Happy birthday.
Amazing! I don't know what to say --
Thank you.
This one looks like a Steward. They're not warm, but rigor hasn't set in. This didn't happen all that long ago, Jim.
And almost got tossed out of the Academy...
The order comes from Starfleet command, Dr. Marcus, direct from the General Staff.
Repeat... what's wrong? What's wrong?
Stage One of our experiments was conducted in the labora- tory. Stage Two of the series will be attempted in a lifeless underground; Stage Three will involve the process on a plane- tary scale. What follows is a computer projected simulation of Stage Three. Please watch closely.
Mistake? We're all alone here. They waited until everyone was on shift-leave to do this. Reliant is supposed to be at our disposal, not vice-versa.
I suppose it <u>could</u> be a particle of preanimate matter caught in the matrix...
You know what she'll say...
I saw it -- !
There is some pain at first, I am told, and then the effects are quite benign -- until the end. That was what I learned from watching my wife.
Then to whom do you report directly regarding Genesis?
I'm Doctor Marcus!
She's making it up! My father was Professor --
So am I. My friends were killed, too.
I don't know.
Let them eat static.
Locking phasers on target.
Visual --
<u>Full power damn you</u>!
Khan, listen to me -- if its me you want, I'll have myself beamed aboard. All I ask is that you spare my crew.
Don't play with me, Kirk, my hand is on the phaser control --
I've given you no word to keep, Admiral. In my judgment, you simply have no alternative.
Still, 'old friend.' You've managed to kill just about everyone else, but like a poor marksman, you keep missing the target.
KHAN!
Aye, sir.
I'm going down to the station.
Picture, Mr. Saavik.
Sensors, Captain?
I say again. This is Enterprise. Please acknowledge signal. Please --
My sister's youngest, Admiral. Crazy to get to space.
No promises, Mr. Scott. On your way.
Admiral, if we go by the book, like Lieutenant Saavik, hours could seem like days.
Oh do you? Have you any idea, Midshipman Preston, how many times I've had to listen to Mr. Scott on the Comm, telling me his troubles? Have you any idea the ribbing I've had to endure in the officers' mess to the effect that the Enterprise is a flying death trap?
Yours was not a solution which would have occurred to a Vulcan mentality.
She's half Romulan, Jim. The admixture makes her more volatile than -- me, for example.
The Enterprise. I must check in before your inspection. And you?
Yes.
Really, Dr. McCoy; you cannot ban the acquisition of knowledge because you distrust the moral implications of what you learn. Logic suggests --
WHO? Who knew just where to hit us? And <u>why</u>?
The prefix code is 16309. All commands from each Starship bridge are relayed electronically; each ship has its own prefix combination code...
Engine room... Scotty, do we have enough power for the transporters?
Steady as you go...
Humor... that is a difficult concept ... it is not logical...
Energize defense fields.
Who?
I changed the conditions of the test. I received a commendation for original thinking.  I don't like to lose.
Engage warp engines --
Best guess, Mr. Sulu. Fire when ready.
We can't all be perfect, Saavik. You must control your prejudices and remember that as a Vulcan as well as a Romulan you are forever a stranger in an alien land. Around you are humans, and as a member of the Starfleet you are unlikely ever to escape their presence or their influence. You must learn to tolerance in addition to all else I have taught you. Tolerance is logical.
Aye, sir.
You do this -- for friendship?
Then you stand here alive because of a mistake -- made by your flawed, feeling, human friends. They have sacrificed their futures because they believed that the good of the <u>one</u> -- you -- was more important to them.
-- That's the general idea.
Let's hope so, Bones. Mr. Sulu, set us down in Golden Gate Park.
Captain Spock and I will attempt to trace these whale songs to their source.
Uhura is busy. I am monitoring.
That's crazy! Who would send a probe hundreds of light years to talk to a whale?
Fundoscopic examination is unrevealing in these cases!
Negative. It's impacting on all our systems!
Captain... All systems have failed... We are functioning on reserve power only.
It gives me a great sense of danger. We have to beam in next to the reactor room, not in it.
Like what?
All right. Let's take it from the top.
Name?
Dr. McCoy, you, Mr. Scott and Commander Sulu will convert us a whale tank.
Whoever said the human race was logical?  Now if you'll follow me, I'll introduce you to the Institute's pride and joy.
To put it mildly. Since the dawn of time, men have harvested whales for a variety of purposes, most of which can be achieved synthetically at this point. A hundred years ago, using hand-thrown harpoons, they did plenty of damage -- but that was nothing compared to what they've achieved in this century.
I buy that. What about him?
LDS?? Are you dyslexic on top of everything else? Come on, Lemme give you a lift. I have a notorious weakness for hard luck cases -- that's why I work with whales.
You've already been that. C'mon.
What does that mean, exactly? Take their chances.
How did you know Gracie's pregnant? Nobody knows that.
It's his way.
Tell me when the whales are going to be released?
No, I'm from Iowa. I just work in outer space.
That's what you think.  Okay...Truth... I'm from what, on your calendar, would be the late 23rd Century. I've been sent back in time to bring two Humpback Whales with me in an attempt to... repopulate the species.
You asked.  Now, will you tell me something?  George and Gracie's transmitter. What's the frequency?
Right.
Yes... And I'm glad you're here. Though I'll admit, you picked a hellova time to drop in...
Have I flipped out? ... Is any of this real?
Kirk. They're gone.
They were taken last night. I wasn't told. They're in Alaska by now.
Calm yourself, Nurse.  Scotty, get us out of here!
You need me.
There is one, but I cannot guarantee its success. We could attempt to find some Humpback Whales.
What is our target in time?
Surely you can be more specific...
Yes.
Spock, don't call me Admiral. Don't you remember: you used to call me Jim... Now what's your question?
Admiral, if we were to assume these. whales are ours to do with as we please, we would be as guilty as those who caused their extinction.
Admiral, you must wait one damn minute.
Continue on course. Chekov, any signs of Federation escort?
Steady as she goes...
... Aye sir...?
Picture, Uhura!
Right.  Now look: I want you all to be very careful. This is terra incognita. Many customs will doubtless take us by surprise. It's a forgone conclusion these people have never seen an extra-terrestrial before.
Sir... Estimating one nautical mile.
Humpbacked - people.?
Two?
Sorry, Admiral. We just thought you'll like to know, we're beaming them now.
How long, Scotty?
Don't take too long. We're sitting ducks for their radar systems...  Mr. Sulu, impulse climb.
Mr. Scott, don't make jokes, we are in danger of -
On my way...!
... Are you joking?
Tell her I feel fine...
Sulu Hikaru.
Capability, yes. But where can warp drive take us, except away from here...?
Why?
Then you must spend your life answering questions.
I've been shot at... thrown into the lake out of an invisible ship that's come to abduct us all... what's there to panic about?
When time seemed to stop... and you could almost live in that moment...
This way!
I'll be here.
The "mighty" Federation could learn a few things from this village...
Perhaps, that is true.
The artificial lifeform was right?
Your Captain used to cut quite a rug...
They should be quarantined before joining the ship's population.
He's right. Our shields have been upgraded to protect against the environmental anomalies...
It is not over.
If you begin the procedure while the planet is still populated, the Federation will pursue you until...
... And now he's holding our people hostage down there...
This was too important for the Enterprise to be on the sidelines, Admiral...
Someone probably said the same thing about the Romulans a century ago.
There are metaphasic particles all over The Briar Patch. Why must this planet be...
There's nothing further to be gained from this...
If we could lure him away from the bridge...
May I talk to you alone?
On screen.
Blow out the ramscoop. Stand by full thrusters.
We can't delay the archaeological expedition to Hanoran Two. It would put us into the middle of monsoon season...
Go back to your quarters  That's an order.
We'll skip the court martial this time... Picard out.
Yes... yes, I... can hear you...
Worf, what the hell are you doing here?
It's good to have you back, Worf.  Slow to one-third. Take us in.
The metaphasic radiation in those rings is in a state of extreme flux. Steer clear of them, Mister Worf...
Make it so.
Beam him out!
I'm not letting go of him.
No, sir...
You have two days to become experts... Mister Worf, your job and mine will be to find a plan to safely capture Data.
Good question.
No children?
Got a minute? I... need a little counseling.  First time for everything. Do I... lie down... or what?
... I believe you...
On this ship, anything can happen. And usually does.
Absolutely.
We're here to find Zephram Cochrane. He may be injured or dead.
I'm afraid so. If the Borg succeed in preventing First Contact with the Vulcans... Earth will remain in the Second Dark Age... an easy target when the Borg arrive in the 24th century.
Let's hope so. Because if Cochrane dies... the future may die with him.
It was an experience. Metal scalpels... needle and thread...
Intelligence... ambition... desire... I bring order to chaos...
It is impossible to imagine sensations for which I have no frame of reference.
It would appear that you are attempting to graft organic skin onto my endo-skeletal structure.
A universe of sensation is waiting for you... don't you want to explore it... with me?
And I need to control this ship. Let me into your mind.
I believe so.
Go to impulse. Where's the Borg ship?
Power. There hasn't been a lot of wind through here for the last couple of weeks. Most of the batteries are depleted.
I told you, there's no --
Understood. Keep me informed.
I have the password right here.
It could be the radiation, Captain. Try from the surface.
As they used to say... all systems are go.
Bring the warp core on-line. I'll lay in a heading.
Speed -- two hundred, seventy-five thousand kilometers per second.
Lieutenant, actually. Lieutenant Jonathan Scrimm. I'm the head of the Resurrection Protective Force.  And you are?
Oh... here and there. You know how it is.
California. San Francisco.
I'm an old friend of Cochrane's... I wanted to see how he was doing.
The invasion plans.
Wrong answer, Mister Picard. Try again.
Yes, he is.
Yes... I wanted to ask you about some photographs I saw out at the silo. There were three of them... printed on some kind of fabric.
Did you take any other pictures of the rocket?
Trade. Okay. The photographs... for a straight answer.  Who are you? And how do you know Zephram?
No... not like you and Doctor Crusher used to be.
Myself... and a few other friends of Zephram's.
Aye, sir.
Western hemisphere... North American continent...
Steady as she goes.
I'll keep in contact. You have the Bridge.
Yes, sir.
It appears that someone has taken over the Environmental Control Room.
I'll keep that in mind.
Mister Worf... find Data if you can, but your top priority is isolating the Borg.
At present I'm awaiting a full report from Enterprise. Pending that I am constrained to observe Interstellar Law.
The charge is murder.
Vulcans sleep lying down...
Thank you, nurse. Jim, she's ready! Lock and load!
Can you - ?
Chancellor Gorkon, can you hear me? Chancellor...?
Bones, are you afraid of the future?
Some people ARE afraid of the future; of what MIGHT happen;  I was frightened, really frightened.
Still think we're finished?
She didn't need our help getting anywhere... where did she get these convenient clothes? And don't tell me that flare is standard prison issue...
And the good news is they're not going to prosecute.
Starfleet's killed an awful lot of natural phenomena in the name of "exploration"...
Stand...?
Barely.
The Chancellor herself will testify that the defendant's hands shook.
I don't mind. Smuggling. Guilty. I come from Arc. Smuggling is an ancient and respected trade there.
I'm not sure how to take that.
Very much.
Well, I -
I am.
Captain Sulu... on assignment... anyone seen Spock?
Torpedo bay! DID we fire those torpedoes?
What ARE we searching for, Mr. Spock?
ALL uniforms?
Is that wise, sir? I mean, given their situation -  Aye, sir.
Chancellor. We've been ordered to escort you through Federation space to your meeting place on Earth.
Commander, face to face at last.. you have my thanks..
Starfleet's been charting and cataloging planetary atmospheres. All vessels are equipped with chemical analytic sensors...
We must do this again soon.
Give a girl a chance, Captain.
We didn't kill Gorkon.
Don't you know? Everyone on Rura Penthe is here for life.
Anything else you want to tell me?
Energize...
Plot a course for Kronos, Lieutenant.
Right -
Right standard rudder, Z plus five degrees...
Sir?
I won't allow Starfleet to be dismantled over some Klingon promises.
I'm telling you. Hang on.  How many of those things are there? Come on, Lieutenant, you're charged with murder...
Jim, there is an historic opportunity here -
Congratulations, Lieutenant. That must make you very proud...
Far be it for me to dispute my first officer. Starfleet has always -
I am uncertain.
We've fired on the Chancellor's ship -
I too was blind. I knew about HER - and I did nothing. I trusted too much.
I was PREJUDUCED by those achievements.
Make ourselves a target?
... is to trust him.
This is the Starship Enterprise, Captain James Kirk commanding.
Not from a distance. She won't show up on ANY type of scan.
A lie?
I do not think so. Enterprise has disobeyed orders and harbors two escaped convicts. Admiral Donald will make certain all your ship-to- shore transmissions are jammed.
What?
Negative. The subspace shockwave originated at bearing three-two- three, mark seven-five, the location is...  Praxis. A Klingon moon. Barren of indigenous life forms but -
I think  not.
There was an enormous neutron energy surge.
If another ship had been beneath us the Klingons would've seen her!
How do both sides overcome ingrained prejudice?
Yes, sir.
But you didn't join a conspiracy.
Yes, please continue.
You are me.
No. Can I move now?
For how long?
You're working late.
He was a bit proud as I recall.
Can you describe it, Deanna?
Not tonight, I have work here.
Will and Deanna joining the Titan. Dr. Crusher going to Starfleet Medical...
Now, you make a toast.
Thank you, Data.  Let's see what she can do.
Mister Worf, accompany Data please.
On my way.
Fire!
Of you?
No, sir, it is not possible. The B-9 is physically identical to me, although his neural pathways are not as advanced. But even if they were, he would not be me.
Commander Riker, evasive maneuvers!
Negative.
Captain, I don't recommend transporting, that ion storm doesn't look very neighborly. -It could head this way with- out much warning .
An individual more like you, you mean.
I would like to pick you up now. May I do that?
The least I could do for you, Deanna.  Besides, you know me... I’m a talking head.
With pleasure, Captain.
Do you have a moment, sir?
You're speaking of emotional investment?
This isn't real.
You sick bastard!
Very logical, Deanna... But your heart doesn't constrain itself to mere logic.  To leave all of this behind and be with me.
Do you have life support?
Understood.
What do we know about the planet?
And that's exactly what he's going to do.
What are you doing to Counsellor Troi?
There'll be another after me. And another after that. You'll find we're a resilient species.
What sort of signature?
If you don't mind.
Captain's prerogative, Will. There's no foreseeable danger... and your wife would never forgive me if anything happened to you.
Acknowledged ...  ...I'll talk to Data.
It's an old psychological strategy, Number One. To put him in a position of dominance and make us uneasy.
We can only hope so.
I promise you in time, she'll become your home ...If I could offer you one piece of advice?
The honor was mine. Captain Riker.
You know I do.
You'll acquire a taste for it.
Not quite. I envy the hair- line.
There's so much, and so much of it is dull...
I know.
I'm honored to think I might someday speak with such eloquence.
Don't be so vain. After we found it, we made a few modifications. An extra memory port, a hidden transponder. Perhaps your eyes will be a bit less confident when you learn I've gained access to Starfleet's communications protocols. I now know the location of your entire fleet ...  You may go.
You know that's not possible.
Long ago.
Childish dreams, Captain. Lost in the dilithium mines of Remus. I'm what you see now.
He is what his life has made him!
Two ships decloaking, sir! Romulan!
It is... invigorating.
We're being hailed.
My time. I'll spend it how I choose.
She is here.
I have a purpose.
Praetor.

I don't want to scare them away.
No, we can handle this.
Sure.
No.
Elmo's...
About five miles back.
It's a copy of the plaque NASA sent into space on the Pioneer probes.
There's no mistake? You're absolutely sure?
You have to. We're trying to contact the ship. If we do, I'll let you know immediately. Good luck.
I'm afraid the situation demands that kind of risk.
I'll make this as simple as I can, George. They disappeared.
You just do your job, Shermin. We'll make the policy.
Washington thinks it's too late for that.
We'll do that. But how are we going to hold him? He can change himself into a man. He can disappear.
No, we don't.
Okay...
I told you. He let me go. I'm on my way home.
What.
Gear shift.
X...
My...  ...car will take me...  ...up there... home.
Three nights... two days.
I need you.
No.
Why?
'Salt Lake City, please. I do not speak English.'
It was a mistake.
Yes?
I understand.
I've noticed... Do you understand what they're saying?
I do not want to.
Yes. Sing some more.
You shit! I'll decide if I go or not. Not you. I don't know what you do on your planet, but I didn't think that was very nice walking out on me like you did.
You promised you would get me to my ship.
You promised.
I used the last one to jump off the cliff...
Many of my people will not believe those things are possible. On my planet there is only one government, one people, one language. I will be asked a lot of questions.
If you want to keep it, you can.
You could have killed us both!!
Call the police!!
He doesn't understand... just walk away...
Geez, Mrs. Haydn, we just got going.
We're ready.
Then why did they try and sneak in the back door? Tell me that. Why didn't they contact us first and say...
People have made mistakes in these situations before.
Yes.
It was the husband. The police finally got a hold of the witness at work and showed him a picture of the woman.
Parlez vous Francais?... Habla Ingles?... Sprechen zie deutsch?
I don't understand.
Judy, that's stupid.
Yeah, thanks. We appreciate that.
I don't want to hurt anybody. I just want to go home.
Just not the eyes.
You're too goddamned paranoid.
Hey, he was going to kill you.  And this ratfuck paid to have Iris killed, to save his own sorry ass.
I just got to talk to you for one second.
No, Lenny.
Why don't you just split?  You don't love him, anybody can see that.  And to him you're just some kinda possession, like a Ferrari, something to show the other guys.
Tell me.
A virgin brain!  Well we're going to start you off right.  So what do you know about this?  Save us some time...
I'll set you up, get you a deck at my cost... since my thing is the software.
Exactly anything.  Whatever you want.  Whoever you want to be.  Fabri, get us another round, would you.
Listen, before we get into numbers, I want you to try a taste.  I got a deck with me.
Least you can do.
Uh unh, carrying a gun wrecks the line of a fine jacket.
Yeah.  No, not really.
He makes her see her own death, feeds off the reaction... killer and victim merging... orgasm and agony merging.  And he records it all.
I intend to.
You bet.  Did you like it?
Naawww.
I got ways, Lenny, I got ways.  Okay, okay... I got a deal with some a the paramedics.  My guy pages me and I pick it up at the morgue.  So whaddya think?  This clip's gotta be worth at least a grand.  Right?
Yeah, well, the first part's okay. Better than the usual soaps you bring me.
She never gave me a tape.
Strickland.
They jerked my wheels, d'you believe it?  I mean it's outrageous, the computer errors the banks are making lately.  Have you noticed?
Whoa, whoa, whoa.  I said I'd drop you home, but I'm not taking you on your sleazoid rounds.  I've already pulled twelve hours today.
Mace!  You're a life-saver.
Way I look at it, I actually perform a humanitarian service.  I save lives.
Get it.
I've had it.  No more wirehead shit in my car.  You understand?  You want to poach your lobes, do it somewhere else.
No, you're just trying to get off.
Look, I gotta get some sleep.
She still loves me.
No idea.
Snuff clip.  It was Iris.  She said she needed my help and I... aw Jesus, Mace... the sick fucker killed her.
Wants to share.
Yeah.  I'm ghosting pretty bad.
But that doesn't add, does it.
So the guy's not a sicko.
S'okay.  I know you still love me.
The gas tank's going to go any second!
Fire's out, isn't it?
People finding out... seeing... that the LAPD just flat out executed Jeriko One.  Jesus.  Maybe they ought to see.
Deputy Commissioner Palmer Strickland.  The sanctimonious prick who busted me out.  His ass is so tight when he farts only dogs can hear it.  I know this guy.  If there's one cop who's not dirty it's him.
You never told me.
No.  They must have sent it to my beach house by mistake.
Uh unh.
See you downtown.
Fine.  Do you want blood running waist deep in the storm drains?  The gangbangers'll spread like a wave through this city and burn it to the ground.  And when the fires start the street cops'll be capping off at anything that moves.  It'll be all- out war and you know it.
You really want that on your head?
The bearded guy, the creep. Oh, one other thing. Testa, if that's his name, he kept mentioning my feet. Said I had very pretty feet.
Just mopping up. Nine bodies in all.
No, sir.
I sent a female in. The room in question was rented by an Anglo, cash; since then, nothing -- no activity, no phone response.
And it's getting dark. I'm not going to run this into the night.  Eddie, we're walking in. Everything covered?
Sheriff Dylan, this is FBI Agent Thomas Mackelway. Remember me?
Turn the body over. There was something in the autopsy report, yes, here.  These burn marks.
We need to run this through VICAP, search for similar burns.
It's been customized for sleeping capacity.
You must get lonely. You ever think about, you know... 
Yes.
What about his killer?
What's with the eyelids?
What are you doing?
Just step outside, sir. Now. Keep your hands where I can see them.
Who?
I had gotten their trust. We were sharing fantasies. I couldn't risk it.
Then why do I still have a badge?
Pretty embarrassed, to be honest. I had him.
I was looking for a pattern.
I didn't use Low's name.
I understand.
There's a killer out there -- we know who he is. He could be stalking now.
Thank you, Rangers.  Put this man in the unmarked.
They sort of got me on shit detail, no offense.
Maybe I shouldn't put it that way. I'm on my best behavior. I've got to watch what I say.
It explains a lot.
The man knew how to dress.
I was going to be a physician, I am a physician, but I kept drifting over to criminal psych. This seems to be the best of both. My parents still haven't forgiven me.
My guess: he's wondering whether to get more fries or go straight to the chocolate sundae.
Does Koessler ask about me?
What's that?
Jaime? Where are you?
You want to get him? Find something he wants. Get him to come to you.
Suspect Zero.
But he believes in it. That's all that matters. He toyed with you, you toy with him. Convince him you've got a lead on Suspect Zero. Use Zero, you'll find Low.
Hardly anyone calls me Tom. Everybody calls me Mack. I always liked that.
Burn marks. The original M.E. listed it as "burn residue." Same place, the outer thigh, as Karen Sumpter. The UNSUB is able to abduct, kill, transport and bury without detection.
Sit back.
The little piggie speaks.
I believe it is you, sir, who has us jumping through hoops.
You're a smart guy. Tell me what it says.
The file, however, was kept open after your death. NPE disappearances, No Plausible Explanation, were sometimes filed there, deleted if the bodies were found.
Daitz hinted it existed. It was a matter of forming the request in the proper terms.
Who told you about her?
You? You went by the book?
Yeah.
Lead the way, Murman.
[Not this way. Call it a little favor, call it a little thing I'm going to do for you. I'm going to make Chicago come alive for you. You'll owe me one.]
[Don't jerk a jerk-off. There's nothing in the Bureau mainframe.]
[You tell me.]
What did you do to end up here?
Yes, sir.
This case has sent bells and alarms ringing all the way to Washington. Your old boss is coming out.
Hope you never do. At first it feels like a sauna, by the time you hit victim four it's a fucking burning shirt factory.
He wants us to know he's out there, what he's doing. It's not enough just to kill somebody like Speck, he wants us to know he did it.
What is it exactly I don't understand, Agent Mackelway?
Shut up.
You're money, baby.
I'm sorry, I couldn't help it. Let me make it up to you.
You're a comedian?
Hi, Mike. I'm Lorraine.
Well, it still sucks, but you start to see that there are advantages to being single.
Yes. I mean, no. I mean, maybe he would find her, I mean you attractive. Maybe he doesn't like to dance. Maybe all he likes to do is just stand around and drink and smoke and look cool with his buddies who don't dance either...
Oh. You know.
I don't even tell them about anything I'm close on anymore...
Why not? This place is dead anyway.
My pleasure.
Hey, man. At least it's Disney.
...I mean, does it have to be "Goofy"? I was playing Hamlet off-Broadway two months ago, for crying out loud...
What an asshole.
Did you get it?
...And she's with someone else.
Oh... right.
Oh? You know about booking agents... I don't, uh, actually have a west coast agent as of yet...
Why, you like the duck with the cigar? 
...Nah. I'm right across the street...
...The red piece of shit over there...
What kind of things?
...the Michelin commercial...
I'm not home and going out of town tomorrow for a week. Can't you talk for five more minutes?
Hey man, don't sweat it.
Thanks. Thanks, man.
I don't know. It's like not talking to a pitcher in the midst of a no hitter.
Bud.
I know. It's like the opposite of inbreeding. The hottest one percent from around the world migrate to this gene pool.
Wait till summer. I swear, you can't leave the house. It hurts. It physically hurts.
Ah, there's the rub...
Sue. His dad was big Johnny Cash fan.
You're a better man than I am, Charlie Brown.
Don't sweat it. Now I got an L.A. gun story. You should hear the way I tell to the guys back home. He had an Uzi. Mike half-smiles.
What's the point?
Because you left, man. She's got her own world to deal with in New York. She was a sweet girl but fuck her. You gotta move on. You gotta let go of the past. The future is so beautiful. Every day is so sunny out here. It's like Manifest Destiny man. I mean, we made it. What's past is prologue. That which does not kill us makes us stronger. All that shit. You'll get over it.
Sometimes is still hurts. You know how it is, man. I mean, each day you think about it less and less. And then one day you wake up and you don't think of it at all, and you almost miss that feeling. It's kinda weird. You miss the pain because it was part of your life for so long. And the, boom, something reminds you of her, and you just smile that bittersweet smile.
...for the same reason you miss her. You lived with it so long.
You always know the right thing to say.
...He's derivative...
I can't believe you.
What are they doing here?
Believe me, I know what that's like.  Yo, Double Down! What time are we leaving?
She's really special, guys.
Sorry. We got knocked out pretty quickly.
Coffee...  Two coffees. It says "Breakfast Any Time", right?
I'll have "pancakes in the Age of Enlightenment".
I don't know...
What?
Okay Bugsy. Twenty minutes.
This is the hot new place, besides, you love pirates. Tell me Mikey doesn't love pirates.
That's New York, baby. You should know that. Look at the waitresses. I'm gonna get me a peg-leg baby.
What are you talking about? Look at all the honeys.
...but that's two hundred dollars. This is blood money...
I'm just saying, not in this particular case.
Yea, how much?
I know she's coming back.
Baby, did you hear her? "You shouldn't leave without getting something for free." She wants to party, baby.
Oh fuck that. You don't have to try and impress anyone. You think I give a shit? You think I sweat that skanky whore waitress...
"Age of Enlightenment". Shit. Like some waitress in a Las Vegas coffee shop is going to get an obscure French philosophical reference. How demeaning. I may as well have just said "Let me jump your ignorant bones."...
...It's just, I thought "Renaissance" was too Excaliber, it's the wrong casino. She would've gotten it, though...
I hope so.  We gotta go soon.
Hello, Lisa. I'm Trent. What a lovely makeup job.
Oh... "I love you... I can't believe you're doing this... Drugs are bad..." Whatever. After-School bullshit. The role is Brother.
No! Not the camera guy!
What?
You didn't have to get into it, baby.
Don't worry about me, baby. I just wanted you to have a good time.
I heard them talking. They both thought you were money.
Baby, you're so money you don't even know it.
That's just plain silly. Your self- esteem is just low because she's with someone else. But thinking about it and talking about it all the time is bad. It's no good, man. You gotta get out there. The ladies want to love you, baby.
What? That was the best part of the old game.
It's on.
What?
Don't sweat it, baby. This one's a lay-up.
You asked her for her number, and then you tore it up.
That doesn't matter.
We're not messing with you...
No...
Yeah. I guess you could call it that.
Oh. He's got it under control...
That's so bullshit. This is so bullshit.
They're a finesse team...
...Is he brown?
You are so money, and you don't even know it...
You're like this big bear with claws and fangs...
...Yeah.
Don't listen to him. You call whenever it feels right to you.
I know for a fact you haven't, because you never shut up about it. You're like a little whiney bitch...
...it is so on.
Yeah. You probably coulda hit that tonight if you didn't have to drive us home.
Two vodka martinis, straight up, shaken not stirred, very dry, easy on the water.
You owe the Don a service.  In one hour, not before, perhaps later, he will be at your funeral parlor to ask for your help.  Be there to greet him.  If you have any objections speak now, and I'll inform him.
Yes. 
Good.  From me you'll get Justice.
I'll come to you when I need you.
You have to answer for Santino.
Like hell I will.
How bad will it be?
The guy at the gate's outside...says there's a package...
Sure.
And what is the percentage of the Tattaglia family?
Are you worried about security for your million?
The Tattaglias will guarantee your investment also.
Can I do something for you still? You're not too rich, or too famous that I can't help you?
I didn't tell Mama anything.  I was about to come up and wake you and tell you.  Just now.
Barzini.
I could accept everything that's happened; I could accept it, but that I never had a choice.  From the time I was born, you had laid this all out for me.
How did you find out?
Tom, what we need is an Act of Congress to allow Enzo to become a citizen.
There is nothing there.  Not anymore.
Even so, I don't think it is safe here anymore.  I've made plans to move you to a villa near Siracuse. You must go right away.
How do you know I come from America?
Only the son of a Pezzonovanta.
This one could seduce the devil.  A body! and eyes as big and black as olives.
And hair.  Black and curly, like a doll.  And such a mouth.
That's for you to find out.
I'll make him an offer he can't refuse.
You start operating, the five families will start their raids again.  We're at a stalemate Sonny, your war is costing us a lot of money.
Yes.  That's true, you're getting a hell of a reputation.
An accident.  No one was hurt.
Sonny will come after you with everything he's got.
I'll try...It's what the Don would want us to do.
You smooth son of a bitch, let me lay it on the line for you, and your boss.  Johnny Fontane never gets that movie.  I don't care how many Dago, Guinea, wop Greaseball Goombahs come out of the woodwork!
Okay my Kraut-Mick friend, Johnny will never get that part because I hate that pinko punk and I'm going to run him out of the Movies.  And I'll tell you why.  He ruined one of Woltz Brothers' most valuable proteges.  For five years I had this girl under training; singing lessons!  Acting lessons!  Dancing lessons!  We spent hundreds of thousands of dollars--I was going to make her a star.  I'll be even more frank, just to show you that I'm not a hard-hearted man, that it wasn't all dollars and cents.  That girl was beautiful and young and innocent and she was the greatest piece of ass I've ever ad and I've had them all over the world.  Then Johnny comes along with that olive oil voice and guinea charm and she runs off.  She threw it all away to make me look ridiculous.  A MAN IN MY POSITION CANNOT AFFORD TO BE MADE TO LOOK RIDICULOUS!
Did he give you his politicians?
I told you I had a lot of relatives.
Al Capone!
Michael you're trying to scare me...
He's my father's godson; he owes him his whole career.
Then we can have dinner, see a show, and spend one more night.
Shhh, you be the long distance operator.  Here.
I'm thinking about it.
I love you.
Can I go to the hospital with you?
Goodbye.
Don't ask me.
You and I are going to move my father right now...to another room on another floor...Can you disconnect those tubes so we can wheel the bed out?
Jesus Christ, he's my father, Sonny.
What?
You're right, kid, Clemenza is okay. It was Paulie.
Christ, if I could only contact Luca.
To the city.
Cut it out.
They want me to go to the conference with Sollozzo.  Set up the meeting for two days from now.  Sonny, get our informers to find out where the meeting will be held. Insist it has to be a public place: a bar or restaurant at the height of the dinner hour.  So I'll feel safe.  They'll check me when I meet them so I won't be able to carry a weapon; but Clemenza, figure out a way to have one planted there for me.  Then I'll kill them both.
What are you, inspecting the barracks?  You ready?  Did Clemenza tell you be sure to drop the gun right away?
Probably a year...
Yes, I promise.
You took Freddie in because the Corleone family bankrolled your casino.  You and the Corleone family are evened out.  This is for business; name your price.
Did you forget where I live? It's four o'clock.
It's vile.
No, I like him.
Oh, it was.
Yes please!
Well, I knew you, so I suppose you must have known me.
Can you mix a martini?
Your parents met her.
See Venice and die, isn't that right? Or is it Rome? You do something and die, don't you? Okay, Venice is on the list.
No! I've got more than one shirt!
No!
I can't. I can't keep spending your father's money.
Relax. The most important question is where to eat. I hope Freddie made a reservation.
I thought you'd missed the train.
I don't think so, Tom. You can't stay on here without money. It's time we all moved on. Besides I'm sick of Mongi. Especially now with everything -- I really want to move to the North. I need to check out San Remo next week, find somewhere new to keep the boat. But it would be great, though, if you came with me. Our last trip before you leave. There's a jazz festival -- we could say goodbye in style. What do you think? A last trip?
To Mongi. You're cheerful tonight.
No reason. Because you're leaving, I guess. I don't think you were there, were you?
I mean it as a compliment. You've got such great taste, I don't know. Most of the thugs at Princeton had tasted everything and had no taste. Used to say, the cream of America: rich and thick. Freddie's the perfect example.
Do you even like jazz -- or was that something for my benefit?
So tell me.
Really? To Italy?
How?
I'm actually a little relieved you're going, to be honest. I think we've seen enough of each other for a while.
I don't think so. Come back with me to Rome. There's this great new club. Have some drinks, lotta ladies...
It's Freddie. Let me in.
I don't think he's at dinner at 6.30pm. If you said he was still at lunch I'd believe you. Incredible. The guy has disappeared off the face of the earth.
Which is horseshit. Have you heard him play that thing?  He can't.
In fact the only thing which looks like Dickie is you.
I think it might hurt her to know.
Where's Mr MacCarron?
Hello Tom. You're off? What are your plans?
I absolutely agree with Marge.
Yes -- I'm on a good streak, thanks.
No.  Hello, I'm Tom Ripley.
I don't believe it. Wild horses wouldn't drag Dickie to --
Really? That's swell. No, I was just -- you're way ahead of me! Great!
I'd swear he didn't. Of course he didn't.
Hello Marge!
Dickie hasn't killed himself. I'm sure of that. There's a private detective on the case now -- a Mr MacCarron -- Dickie's father's employing him.
He's having an early night.
Marge, I'm in the bath. Won't be long.
Why do I think there's never been a Ripley rainy day?
You were at the Opera? Well, that explains -- yes I was there. I was there with Dickie.
My father wants me in New York. He builds boats. I'd rather sail them. I travel under my mother's name.
Emily.  Just kidding.
As in the...?
What?
I'll take them both.
Okay then, you're crazy.
They're letting me have this vacation. Which is why the get-up. Which is why you haven't heard from me.
He's taken over the case because... they're annoyed the previous chap let Dickie... disappear when he was the only, he was the only suspect in Freddie's murder.
He thinks it's very cold to be sleeping outside.
I am. I really am. And I've been travelling. I just can't seem to get that far north.
I can't later.
Tomorrow's possible. Do you know Dinelli's? Piazza di Spagna?
Ten thirty?
Okay. Marge, see you tomorrow.  It's really good to meet you.
Don't be daft. It's fine. I'm delighted you finally made it to Venice. I'm delighted, contrary to rumour, you're still in one piece?
That Dickie murdered you and is travelling under your passport. I know, ridiculous.
A Roma, circa tre settimane fa.
I give up.
Well, that's entirely your fault. And, if I fall overboard, that'll be your fault too.
November 7th is my information.
May I ask... why would you speak to your friend and not your fiancée?
The .32's $150 -- and you're really getting a good deal now -- and all together it comes to, ah, seven eighty- five for four pieces and a holster. Hell, I'll give you the holster, we'll make it seventy-five and you've got a deal -- a good one.
If you don't mind, mam, I'd be mighty pleased if you'd go out and have some coffee and pie with me.
Well, Betsy mam, I drive by this place here in my taxi many times a day. And I watch you sitting here at this big long desk with these telephones, and I say to myself, that's a lonely girl. She needs a friend. And I'm gonna be her friend. 
I can believe that.
I had a regular job for a while, days. You know, doin' this, doin' that. But I didn't have anything to do at night. I got kinda lonely, you know, just wandering around. So I decided to works nights. It ain't good to be alone, you know.
Just people people, you know. Just people.  Had a dead man once.
I know. I could have picked you up.
Late one night. About three. At the plaza.
I work a single, which means there's no replacement -- no second man on the cab. Six to six, sometimes eight. Seventy-two hours a week.
What?
No, these are the kind that couples go to. They're not like the other movies. All kinds of couples go. Honest. I've seen them.
What's wrong?
No, Travis. You're a sweet guy and all that, but I think this is it. I'm going home.
It's very simple. You go your way, I'll go mine. Thanks anyway, Travis.
The senator's white paper is almost ready, Bets. Should we wait for that?
More people watch it.
Kidding around... you know, fun.
With who?
I know that guy. His hand looks like a paw. An old Black guy, the newsstand at --
Now look more closely. Look around the eyes and chin. See? See there?
We don't have ju-jukes. We don't have Coca-Cola. We only got Royal Crown Cola.
That's a dollar forty-seven.
Ask Travis. He's the ladies man.
A real skunk.
I never use mine. But it's a good thing to have. Just as a threat.
Stick up?
Don't you want to make it?  Can't you make it?
I think so. I tried to get into your cab one night, and now you want to come and take me away.
I was stoned. That's why they stopped me. When I'm not stoned, I got no place else to go. They just protect me from myself.
That fella "Sport" looks like a killer to me.
He's worse than an animal. Jail's too good for scum like that.
Me? I could never go to a place like that.
I've got something important to do. I can't leave.
You just gonna leave 'em?
You can't leave 'em to do the same to other girls. You should get rid of them.
I want to -- what else can I do with my money?  You may not see me again -- for a while.
The Empire State in fog means something, don't it? Do you know, or don't you? What is your number, cabbie?
I'll tell you, Travis, I've learned more about this country sitting in taxi cabs than in the board room of General Motors.
Well, he should clean up this city here. It's full of filth and scum. Scum and filth. It's like an open sewer. I can hardly take it. Some days I go out and smell it then I get headaches that just stay and never go away. We need a President that would clean up this whole mess. Flush it out.
I ride around nights mostly. Subways, buses. See things. Figur'd I might as well get paid for it.
Physical? Criminal?
Hell, we ain't that much fussy anyway. There's always opening on one fleet or another.  Fill out these forms and give them to the girl at the desk, and leave your phone number. You gotta phone?
What kind of guns do you guys use? .38's?
Shit.
Funny, you don't look hip. 
Yeah, Iris. You know anybody by that name?
Yeah?
It happens.
You want to talk about it?
That record company.in Nashville wants to hear my demo tape.
No. I'm going to give you dancing lessons.  What the fuck do you think?
Find the rockets.  If they're guarded, kill the men guarding them.
The truth is, I'm a lot of things, but communist isn't one of them.
I wish you were coming with me.
Delly... thanks, thank you.  I'll take good care of this.
That always used to work.
How'd they get it inside?
It doesn't seem right, this being down here.  It ought to be where people can see it.
And why not?
Sorry.  You don't know how many times I've heard that.  "A lady lawyer?  Are you crazy?"  Like a woman couldn't be as good a lawyer as a man.  Or better, in fact.
Yes.  Hic!
Eventually.  We were going to be  engaged... when you came back from  overseas...
Have you got a cigarette?
No, they're not.  I'd say your investment was paying dividends.
Alex and Charlie?  Simple.  Alex is the smarter one.
Thanks.
Yes sir.  But I didn't go to Lawson to run The Bijou, that was... that was something that just happened. You see, I was involved in an accident in Lawson, and I spent some time recovering there.
I'm interested in knowing if you remember things you did in your past, or if they've been conveniently "blotted out" as a result of your "accident."
I'm not refuting anything.
That's not a contradiction at all, sir.  I went to the meeting, but I didn't go as a member.
The witness need not be hesitant to say anything before this committee, as long as it's the truth.
No identification at all.  What're you thinkin', Cecil?
Albert Lucas Trumbo.  But you've been "Luke" since you were a baby.
Ah.
Oh, I had Irene and Old Tim but they really couldn't help much. Broke their hearts when we closed up.  Broke mine, too.  But now that you're back, well, things will be different around here, that's for sure.  C'mon, I'll show you where we live.
Mother.  She's beautiful.
You know, I hate to bring this up, but screens and uniforms and paint and repairs are going to take money, which I'm willing to bet none of us has.
No, your mother did, then I did after she passed.
Son, I think you loved the Bijou even more than I did.  You've got to remember that.  You've got to.
... Ernie.
They're...
Oh, no, I...
Dad, I...
What.
Then I'll call you a cab.
It's possible.  I just don't remember.
Wouldn't blame him if he was.
I... I don't believe this.
Leo, I was trying to impress a skirt.  You know me, I'm non- political.  Republican, Democrat, Communist, there's not a dime's worth of difference between 'em anyway.
I was decorated.
Exactly.
And I won't be a communist anymore.
So it doesn't make any difference that I'm not one now, and have never been one.
Not any more.
Leo, you were in there, you saw what I did.  You think they're gonna let me write pictures?  Hell, they're probably gonna throw my ass in jail.
Besides, I don't even know if I want to write anymore.
When was that?
What?
No.
Sure.  Come on in.  I was just packing.
Thanks.
Oh.
You bet, honey.
What exactly did you hear?
Actually, my grandpap.  But "ancestors" sounds better, don't it?  Here.
'Course they all know me.  And I know all them.  Town's got my name, don't it?
My girlfriend.  If she still is...
Lovebirds.
Thank you.
All right. 
What do you mean?
Different?
Nothing! I simply existed. So what was the answer? A jealous woman, right? A clinging possessive mother.  Wrong. With all due respect to Oedipus, I don't think that was the case at all.
Afraid I'd give Mitch.
Afraid of any woman who'd give Mitch the only thing Lydia can give him -- love.
I can understand his position. He went through a lot with Lydia after his father died. He didn't want to risk going through it all over again.
Then you know. Little girls in brown beanies. Deadly. Here I have a life. I'll go into that classroom on Monday morning, and I'll look out at twenty- five upturned little faces, and each of them will be saying, 'Yes, please give me what you have.'  And I'll give them what I have. I haven't got very much, but I'll give them every ounce of it. To me, that's very important. It makes me want to stay alive for a long long time.  That's the first reason.
I'll be going, too, to help out. It should be fun, Melanie.
Then go.
Just listen to them!
No!
Yes?
Oh, I suppose so.
Take it into the living room, would you, hon?
Is she all right?
That's where the Brenners live.
Nope, just Lydia and the two kids.
Follow the road straight through town 'til it curves off on the left. That'll take you right around the bay to their front door.
Mmmm.
It's nothing.
Shall I call the doctor?
I had to acknowledge a delivery.  Mother, I'd like you to meet...
Miss Daniels is staying for the weekend. In fact, I've already invited her to dinner tonight.
...get away without thanking you in some small way. After all, you haven't even met Cathy and you are staying for the weekend...
Caviat emptor, Mother. Let the buyer beware.
Yes, Mother.
Mother?
I think he got a little scratch, Mother.
I don't know when.  We'll see what...
Al Malone wanted him out at the Fawcett farm.
And if you don't?
I don't mind, really.
Shhhh. Shhhh.
We know what it is, Al.
Didn't know how he got in there. Had a broken leg, turned out. Just fluttering all around there. 
Eleven. In the middle of the party, some gulls came down at the children. And Miss Daniels was attacked by a gull just yesterday after...
That's all right.
Lovebirds.
Yes. I understand there are different varieties, it that true?
Aren't these lovebirds?
I suppose not. Is there an ornithological reason for keeping them in separate cages?
I was merely drawing a parallel, Miss Daniels.
That's right. What are you doing in Bodega Bay?
Criminal.
How do you know Annie?
I think we'll have to shave the hair. Deke, have you got a razor?
It was no trouble at all. I simply called my father's paper. Besides, I was coming up here anyway, I already told you...
I was! And all I get for my pains is a... a... a hole in the head!
Look, Mr. Brenner...
You are, aren't you?
Then it's settled. What time is dinner, Mother?
Of course, how stupid of me. A quarter to seven, will that be all right?
You're sure now? You won't hire a boat or anything?
Famished.
Oh, yes.
Yes, I was lying.
It said, "Dear Mr. Brenner, I think you need those lovebirds, after all. They may help your personality." That's what it said.
I'm trying to get you to stay for dinner. We're going to have a lot of roast left over.
Helping travelers.
What about Thursdays and Fridays?
I'm glad you do.
No, thank you.
After the gulls attacked.
At Annie's house. She's all right.
The past fifteen minutes.  It seems to be a pattern, doesn't it? They strike and disappear, and then they start massing again.
Inland.
I thought they'd have stopped by now.
Almost two a.m.
How about you?
I don't want to be safe. I want to be with you.
I... I don't think so. If we get through town, I think we'll be all right.
Hello, Miss Daniels.
You said three o'clock.
Well, this one won't be a chick, will he?
Oh, good! Oh, wonderful.
I have no idea.
No, you'd better send him. May I use your phone?
Immediately.  Is this the Daily News? Melanie Daniels. Would you get me the city desk, please?
What were the crows after at the school?
Daniels. I think they were after the children.
Are you discussing gamebirds now? All birds are not gamebirds, you know.
No one ever said you were, Mitch.
Can we go on living here otherwise?
Not if they're starting a war.
...probably contain more than a hundred billion birds!
Probably herring gulls. They arrive in November, you know, and don't migrate North again until March or...
Can't you please finish your drink?
That's right.  Gray, the cabman. I've had a bit of dealing with MacFarlane in the past, you know.
Ma'am, is you'll allow me, I'd like to give you cause for courage -- Dr. MacFarlane is a great man -- I think he's the greatest man in medicine.  God would not have given him such gifts if they were not meant for Georgina's cure.
I can't do that -- you heard MacFarlane.
MacFarlane
Come -- it's a chance to try out your bedside manner, Fettes.  Take a look at the child.
Excuse me.
You're too good a man, Fettes -- I'll not let you quit.  I'll make an assistant of you -- that'll pay your keep and your tuition, too --
What the devil do you mean?  You have your lodgings, a certain stipend -- I thought I had arranged everything for you --
You're a man of the world, Fettes, you wouldn't hold me to promise given in drink.
Look here, Fettes.  Not I nor anyone else knows enough about the spinal column and its intricacies to insure success in such an operation.  I would have to study the matter.  Have we any "subjects"?
Wait, Doctor -- wait!  The child's fainting.
That's the way of it, Fettes.  You bring the lassie to me.
I'll have no more to do with it. I'll not put my neck into the noose, not even for your sake, Dr. MacFarlane.
No.
Why, yes.
He was a nice horse.
I can't.
Don't call me that confounded name.
Medicine?  That'll keep.  Sit down.
I am the best man for the job.
I'm not concerned about the child, Toddy.  It's you I'm thinking of, I'd like to see you prove that a lot of things I know haven't hurt Toddy MacFarlane any.
I suppose we can't prevent that, Gray --  -- for auld lang syne.
Here, have another glass, MacFarlane. I'll take you home and we'll be friends again -- now that you know that you're Knox's man and my friend -- aye, forever.
I'll tell you what, Toddy. It's because I ran down the streets with the mud and the stones around my ears and the mob yelling for my blood. It's because you were afraid to face it -- and you're still afraid.
I take no gifts from you.
It wouldn't be half so much fun for me. Toddy, as to have you come here and beg --
No -- a pride to know that I can force you to my will. I'm a small man -- a humble man -- and being poor, I've had to do much that I did not want to do. But so long as the great Dr. MacFarlane jumps at my whistle, that long am I a man -- and if I have not that, I have nothing. Then I am only a cabman and a grave-robber.
You mean we would sell the bodies to the doctors together? Dig them up?
I never heard that song. But what did they do?
Yes, Doctor.
It comes at intervals.  They used to be months apart -- but they've been growing more frequent --  much more frequent.
There's nothing I can say for one small child?
Aye --
He must leave me alone.
Where are they? Last chance.
We're getting there. Because in his so-called construction job, Tommy makes a daily delivery to a place called "The Hole."
A scar. On the arm. Of the man who planted this in Alex Corvis's car.
I want Lauren. I want my life back. I want... to know why.
How can you die if you're already dead?
And another one. There. Erlich. Took a wrong turn.
No! Why are you haunting me?
It's all my fault. Oh God. I wish I were dead.
My father.
Erin. I'll always be with you.
Some hooker phoned it in. There was a riot at his apartment yesterday.
Could say that.
I do. Every day.
She's... sick.  Actually she never had Mai Tais before.
Not tonight. Honest.
This guy said he was a friend of Lauren's. He had like paint all over his face.
That guy in the cemetery today said he knew everything about Lauren.
He said he'd prove it.
Erin. It wasn't supposed to happen.
What a brilliant idea. I never would have thought of it.
I talked to most of them this morning... They were all very curious about the meeting.
He'll be there at 8:30.
My name is Klaatu.  I spent two days at your Walter Reed Hospital. Room 309. My doctor's name was Major White -- and I had a very attractive nurse called Ruth, who's getting married next Wednesday.  If you are not interested -- or if you intend to turn me over to your Army -- we needn't waste any more time.
It isn't faith that makes good science, Mr. Klaatu. Its curiosity.  Sit down, please. I have several thousand questions to ask you.
Violent action -- since that seems to be the only thing you people understand.  Leveling the island of Manhattan, perhaps -- or dropping the Rock of Gibraltar into the sea.
That's what I came to see you about.
I leave that in your hands.
Yes.
That can easily be arranged.
Something dramatic -- but not destructive.  It's quite an interesting problem.  Would day after tomorrow be all right? Say about noon?
Gee, why, Mom? He's my best friend... And he's awful good in arithmetic. He even helps Professor Barnhardt.
I followed Mr. Carpenter -- right after you left -- and, gee, Mom, where do you think he went? Right into the space ship!
Yes, dear. Come on now.  Bobby, your shoes are soaking!
He lives here in Washington, doesn't he?
Where is that?
Well, sure I would, but --  Aw, I'll bet you'd be scared.
Sure. Didn't you ever hear of Arlington Cemetery?
Certainly.  Tell me, Bobby -- do you have to have money to go there?
No -- I want to take you to the movies.  Do you think they'd accept these?
Mr. Brady's a cop.
Sit down, Mr. Harley.
I am not concerned, Mr. Harley, with the internal affairs of your planet. I consider that to be your business -- not mine.
I can judge only by what I see.
A good insurance salesman wouldn't give you time to think.
The picture starts at eight-fifty.
All right, Tom -- it's true. I know it's true.
That's what I'm trying to tell you. We mustn't do anything about it. Believe me, Tom, I know what I'm talking about.
But he isn't a menace! He told me what he came here for.
He has his homework to keep him occupied.
Back to the boardinghouse. I'll be safe there for the afternoon -- and I can keep an eye on Bobby. He's the only other person who knows anything about--
You mean he has the power of life and death?
I have never seen such a stone. Will you please tell me where it came from?
In this case the secret wouldn't be worth much. He doesn't know the answer himself.
No -- I'm afraid not.
You better get some fresh air.
Santa Carla has become a haven for the undead.
The Prince of Darkness.
Man, we totally annihilated his night-stalkin' ass!
<u>Four</u> to go.
Maximum body-count.
Honda 250, huh?
Good idea.  Marko.  We're hungry.
What?...
Get your bike.  We're going someplace.
Where the hell are you from, Kryton???
His fingernails are longer, but he always has bad breath.
That is very probable.  What's your reasoning?
How do you know they're not?
I don't want names!  Just lead me to him.  Where's their nest?
A big legal war wasn't going to improve anybody's situation.  We've all been through enough.  Besides I was raised better than that. Thanks for having us, Dad.
When I dressed like you do now, you threw me out of the house. I used to hate your short hair and your uptight suits... then I went ahead and married one... I went Yuppie and you became a hippie... Were still out of synch.
Closet monster!?
'Again'?  Dad... you haven't had company in this house since Mom died eight years ago.
For what.
Bring your own wheels tomorrow night and you can stay as long as you want... well 'til eleven thirty maybe.
I get off in another twenty minutes.  I thought maybe we'd all get a bite together.
No.  I'm up.
Then let's act like friends. Let's talk.  I know this is a new place, and --
I thought we were poor.
You've heard this story before?
We can't talk about it on the phone.
Sorry, Mom.  It was a mistake. I thought I saw something out the window.  I was reading this horror comic and I guess I go a little carried away...
Okay.  Have you been eating pizza?  You smell like garlic.
I know.  It's so 'Eighties.'  It's the Cute Decade.
Boy!  <u>Somebody</u> areound here sure has bad breath!
Boys Sam's age need a good deal of discipline, or they walk all over you.
No, no.  Just worrying about my boys -- as usual.
If you want your ear pierced, I'll do it.
Michael's great.  I like Michael.
Tonight.  At the boardwalk...
Yes... and I'm to blame for it. If you hadn't met me... if I hadn't liked you... I tried to warn you...
Because I love you...
It's not too late for you to be saved... but each night... it becomes harder and harder for me to resist killing...
That's okay, Mom.  I can see it later.  I'll help you unload.
I'm so excited I just can't hide it.  I'm about to lode control and I think I like it.
Mom, just give me five more minutes. Just five minutes, okay?
Nothing!  I didn't hurt him.  <u>He</u> bit <u>me</u>!  This is <u>my</u> blood!
Screw it, I'm going up anyway.
Let's load 'em.
Nowhere... Just straight to the ocean.
Well, after I worked on him -- thought I'd let him rest.  Left the room for a bit.  When I came back, he was gone.
Nothing.  Nothing at all.
Nobody's getting in here.  You can tell them all that!
Look Blair, maybe you're right about this.  But we've got to be rational. We've got to talk this over.  I'm unarmed and I'm coming in.
Watch Clark.
Ain't it there?
Don't walk behind me.
What's it going to do, being a plant?
Now hold on, you dumb...
Wasn't enough time.  Generator was out, what...?  Thirty minutes. Takes the bastards an hour, maybe two to absorb somebody.
No.  Just let him freeze out there.
Was dark... find a light...
Childs, you got the torch?  You get your ass in here!!
But...
Oh, shit!  Well, hang on!
Cut the bullshit... Okay, Sanchez, you come with us.  Norris... you stay here...  Any of them move -- you fry 'em. And if you hear anything, anything at all you let loose the siren.  We all meet back here in twenty minutes regardless.  And everybody watch whoever you're with.  Real close.
Then I'll have to kill you.
Smart S.O.B.  He put it together piece by piece.
Maybe we should try and fix the radio... try and get some help.
So, I don't want to end up crawling around with them when we go down.
They're not Swedish, goddamn it, they're Norwegian, MacRe --
In this weather?
How far's that?
Started with six.  There'd be four others left.
Well, stick with it.  I want you at it round the clock.  We got to get help in here...
One thousand volts.  Should be enough.
Move it, Palmer.
I ain't going with Sanchez.
He's dead.
We got any more of those electronic chess things down in supply?
MacReady, that you?
MacReady...?
Hear what?
I had an accident.
On the towers?
We're not supposed to think about it.  But I dream about it sometimes...
What kind of stories?
I was lucky.  The others weren't.
Can you show us where they live?
What?
Kalen... hold on a minute.
Yes.  But you've done enough. Thank you for your help... I hope someday people read your books again.
Yes.
The Morlocks didn't build this.
Imagine that... seems that little devil got my power relays...
Alexander.
We have lost the capacity to reproduce.  But the species must continue.
I know.
I don't think that's going to happen.
Now that's what I call plain crazy -- internal combustion is just too dangerous, all those little explosions, never catch on.
There's a cantilevered gasket on the --
You have my word...  ... She's just a beauty.
I need to... um... talk to you.
Emma, you know I have great... admiration for you.
Got here as soon as I could.
No... let's walk through the city.
Nothing -- let's just get out of the park.
You may not like it, but this is the world we live in, Alex.  Little grey men with little grey hats.
Wasn't it?... I have a dream almost every night now.  The Lady and the Tiger, you remember that story?  In the dream I'm alone in a huge chamber with a thousand doors. Behind every door, save one, is a tiger.  I have to make the decision.  Which door conceals Emma?  And I just stand there... looking at the doors...
Thank you...
Some.  But I mean we aren't all so... handsome.
Mm.
Your husband is dead?
Yes.  Or forward into the future. I suppose I really should check on the machine, see that it hasn't been damaged...
You can see so many here.
Not like this... They don't seem so bright with all the city lights.  I never really noticed them much...
Then you came to a desert and mountains...
And you saw a shape ahead of you...
Every night.
Most things.  We're very high on purpose.
It must have been safe.
Orion's belt...
So you can use it now?
Go back to your own time?
Mara --
My laboratory was about... here. And the kitchen was over there, where that tree is.  Mrs. Watchit wouldn't allow me in much... but, yes, this is about the kitchen.
Do they?
Very good.  Now if you will excuse us for a moment.
I took a different route.
They've gone to a better place.
We can't change the day and the night, Alexander.  This is the world.
For our sake, I hope not.
I'm fine.
What about Starks?
Should we be what? Trying to change him any way we can? [Beat] Yes.
We never should have done this to him...
[Beat] So they say. [Off Becker's steady gaze] What?
In where?
Maybe not. [Beat] But I do think you're in a tree... woofing like a dog. And I'm just trying to help you the only way I can think of.
That's too bad.
Getting away with things. Like whatever I may or may not have gotten away with Officer Harrison.
No, we were patients.
Oh yeah, sure. He killed a cop, right?
I didn't. [Beat] Did you have anything to do with his death?
I never touched your father! I swear!
They should just be looking harder.
Later. I'll tell you about it later. We got a session to catch now.
I can't take you out of here in your condition...
His body was found on January 1, 1993, but do you know if that was long after he had died?
Dog tags. [Off her blank look] They've got your name and date of birth for identification.
[Beat] I know it doesn't make sense. It doesn't even make sense to me.
Well, you belong in one.
[Beat] What?
What?
I don't know. [Beat] I thought I was crazy after you left that day. I died. I still think I could be crazy. But then I replayed that night in my head -- the parts of it I could remember -- and it was like...I don't care if I was, or am. I haven't felt that way in a room with someone my whole life. [Beat] And when you left, all I wanted was...
You think Lorenson kills you?
I know. It was perfect. [Beat] Erase my sanity and you erase anything I'll ever say.
Yeah. I called the number yesterday to make sure. Thomas Becker, retired M.D.
You're not crazy.
[Beat] I don't know.
Why would we do that?
I'll die either way.
Because I don't have time.
I don't know how you know about Eugene, but these ideas are part of your delusions.
Who are you kidding, Doc? You or me?
What for?
You still don't believe me, do you?
Who told you this?
Don't you go to jail for that?
[Cutting in] MacKenzie, listen to me. Listen. I'm going to die.
[Gravely] No, I mean in four days, I'm supposed to die.
The Jacket.
[Beat] Thanks.
You don't have anywhere to stay?
No, I'm ok.
[Beat] Why?
May be easy to remember, but not easy to get. Being warm, maybe -- but, look, you don't even have a coat and I still have to chop wood to make a fire. [Beat] And, being happy...you tell me if that's simple.
What.
I could shoot your cousin Eddie.
Honey.  Nothing's impossible.  You just don't shoot someone like that for no reason.  Maybe he was askin' for it.  Anyway, somebody's husband probably got ol' Harlan.
Umm, yes.  She was driving.
If waitin' tables in a bar don't make you an expert on human nature, then nothin' will, and I could've told you that Harlan Puckett would end up buyin' it in a parkin' lot. I'm just surprised it didn't happen before now.
Well, if I had to guess, I'd say it was some ol' gal, some ol' gal's husband.  But it wasn't either one of those two.  The tall one, the redhead, she left me a huge tip.
You're still with us though.  You're somewhere on the face of the earth?
Somebody's butt is gonna bar-b-que.
It's him.
A .38.
The important thing is not to let on that you know anything.  We want to try and find out where they are. Now I don't want to get too personal, but do you have a good relationship with your wife?  Are you close with her?
He's got nothin' to gain by lyin'.  Nothin' at all.  He already got all their money.  I just don't know what we're dealin' with here. Anyway, it went out again last night on Nationwide Teletype.  Let's just wait it out a little longer.  She said she was gonna call back.  Let's just sit tight.
It don't matter.  Brains will only get you so far and luck always runs out.
What for?
Darryl, that's my husband, he says he's not ready.  He's still too much of a kid himself.  He prides himself on being infantile.
Twenty-four isn't young.  I'd already been goin' out with him ten years when we got married.  I've never been with anybody but Darryl.
Yup.  Thanks for the ride.  You all take care.
Thelma?  It's me.
Well, you wanna use the shower?
A regular outlaw.
Are you in town?  This sounds long distance.
Of course.  Of course!  Where?  Can't I bring it to you?  For God's sake, baby, please, just tell me what's happened, what could possibly be so bad?
No, honey.  I told him I was buyin' a car.  What is it for?
I don't know.  It doesn't even matter anymore.  I just want you to be happy... It's not that I don't love you either.  But Jimmy, your timing couldn't be worse.
Believe me, the last thing I want is for you to get punished.
What time are you gonna pick me up?
How come he let you go?
Aw, shit, Thelma, he's gonna kill you.
Only about a hundred people saw you cheek to goddamn cheek with him all night, Thelma!  Who's gonna believe that?!  We just don't live in that kind of world.  Pull over!
What?  Oh, I don't know.  Let me look.
Hmmm.  We gotta get some money.
Well, when you figure it out, wake me up.
Why are you actin' like this?
No, I didn't tell him.  And that's something we gotta get straight. Darryl's been callin', mad as a hornet, makin' all kinds of noise. When you talk to him, you cannot say anything about this.  You gotta make sure everything sounds normal.
Thelma, I'm going to Mexico.  I think I can make it in two and a half days, but I'm going to have to haul ass.  Are you up to this?  I mean, I have to know.  This isn't a game.  I'm in deep shit.  I gotta know what you're gonna do.
Don't you fall apart on me. Goddamnit, Thelma.  Every time we get in trouble, you go blank or plead insanity or some such shit, and this time... Not this time. Everything's changed now... Now you can do whatever you want, but I'm going to Mexico.  I'm going.  Are you coming with me?
It's probably not a good idea.
Nothing.  I'm not gonna tell him a thing.  The least I can do is not make him an accessory any more than he already is.
Nothing.  It got messed up.
What happened?
Are you sure we should be driving like this?  In broad daylight and everything?
Let's get it over with.
What.
Just past Boise City.
Now what what?
Those, too, but you know those little hairy ones?  Those flat-faced little fuckers with those ugly goddamned teeth?
Well, now, maybe you won't have to.
Well, you got it now.
Just ignore him.
Nothing.  It's not funny.
... in Texas... didn't it?  That's what happened... Oh my God.
Just asking.
Are you alright?
You know why.  You already said.
What do you mean?
No, Thelma.  I'm not gonna make any deals.
Eeuww.
Good.
You're drivin'.
Yup.
You too, sweetie, the best.
Where?!
Fuck you.
Grrrreat!
Damn.  I hate that!  I hate bein' called a beaver, don't you?
The thing's kind of heavy.
So you admit it?
That's great, Woogie, I'm happy you're better -- you seem... good --but... you put me through quite an ordeal, you know.
I'm going to fix you up with my new assistant.
I don't know.
I did try calling her.  A few years ago. She wasn't listed.
I also called Unsolved Mysteries.
They told me they don't help out stalkers.  Look, maybe they're right, it's been a long time.
Relax, this guy owes me a big one. A couple years ago he got in a jam up in the Boston office; some bullshit about padding his resume -- like we haven't all done that. Anyway, they were going to let him go but his mother wrote a tear-jerker letter that ended up on my desk.
He'll do better than that. I'll send him down to Miami on business, you throw him a couple bucks on the side, and he'll track her down.
What? On your day off? Do you even know the guy?
Fuck calling her. I'm going down there.
I am?
Remember our friend Healy? Well, I didn't know where to mail his last paycheck so I sent my assistant by his mother's apartment. Turns out there is no diabetic mom. Landlord said she's been dead for ten years.
Don't you see? -- Healy lied to us about everything! The landlord said when he got back from Miami he kept talking about falling for some doctor named Mary!
I don't know what to say.
Car clean? Plenty of gas?
Holy shit, I've been going out with a loaded gun!
Truth is I usually get along better with animals than with people. In Nepal the villagers call me 'Kin-tan- tee', which means 'man who is loved by many animals...  ...who love him a lot, too... and so on.'
Big time.
What can I tell you? It's a healthier lifestyle down here, and it's easier to succeed when your head's clear. Those guys I worked with back in Boston, they were a bad influence.
Is that right? Well good for you, Sull, I'm proud of you.
Healy, what I just tell you?
Ah, fuck ya then, you big pussy. What are you, spotting?
Dumbshit.
Ahh.
Hey, love will make you do fucked-up things.
You own a home there?
Great.
We will, but first I have a surprise.
What say we get outta here and go crush a bucket?
What?
Hey, watch your mouth -- she's a great gal. I'm the dumbshit for lying to her.
Look, let's forget it. Let's forget the whole thing.
Three different guys?
She's in a wheelchair?!
Yeah, this insurance business is too slow for me. I'm going to go down and try my hand at jai alai.
Surprised?
What do you mean 'why'?
What?! You're calling me a stalker?
Your turn?
What?
Nice smokescreen, isn't it?
Absolutely! I was there twice last year. Which building is yours?
How'd you manage that one?
Hey, hey, hey, I'm not the one who started telling bald-faced lies about the competition -- that's crossing the line!
Hey, this is a pretty nice place.
'That right? Good for you.
Think about it. You walk into a video store and you see Eight-Minute Abs and right next to it you see Seven- Minute Abs -- which one you gonna spring for?
Well it's the company motto: 'If you ain't happy we'll send you the extra minute.'
I'm sick of these calorie-countin' pansies. Give me a guy who likes kielbasa and beer and playing thirty- six holes and still has enough energy to take me and Warren out to a ballgame.
No I'm not.
Bet your ass I have. It's an important job, Neighborhood Watch is.
That's because there's a lot of bad people out there. Hey, Puffy tried to warn you about that Steve guy you was seeing -- he was a fucking asswipe -- but you had to find out for yourself, didn't you?
No time, Magda, my show's starting.
You know, a mookalone, a schlep.
Fuck kindred spirits. My little Puffy here's gonna tell you all you need to know about this guy in about two seconds flat. If he starts yapping, he's a loser; if Puffy's relaxed... well, you got yourself a keeper.
Kind of. Ted Peloquin -- one of the sweetest guys in the world.
I can't do it -- I just found out it's his birthday.  I guess I've gotta cancel on Ted.
Look, it's just that something about him struck me as odd last night. He gave me this funny vibe. Anyway, I called some friends back east. They don't know of any architect named Patrick Healy and he's not listed as a Harvard alumnus.
I appreciate you looking out for me.
Huh?
Nope, nope -- dodged a few bullets.  God, I cannot believe I'm standing here with Mary Jenson.
Mary, we haven't seen each other in twelve years.  Don't make me wait another day.
What are you?
What about you, Mare? How the hell'd you manage to stay single?
Wow. That's too bad. He sounds almost perfect.
You forgot your keys!
I... I just want you to be happy, Mary.
Really?
Um, hi, I'm Ted Peloquin. I'm here to take Mary to the prom.
Shhhhhh!
How the hell'd you get the beans all the way up top like that?
Oh God.
I wasn't trying --
So what's up?
Great. Great.  So listen, uh, I was wondering if maybe you wanted to go to the prom you know, with me.
Yeah, so... I'm gonna wait and see what happens there... But that sounds great, yeah.
I don't mind. If you think he can hold me.
Huh...?
Get out of our way, Mr. Secretary. The navy has been running blockades since the days of John Paul Jones.
Did you have any indication of this from Georgi? Any possible warning or sense of motivation?
We can't worry about everything right now. We've got to figure out what we're going to do before we worry about how we do it.
You mean there's something more important than votes? Didn't think I'd live to see the day, Ken.
We got a bunch of smart guys. We lock 'em up together in there, kick 'em in the ass til they come up with options.
It's too politicized with you in there, anyway. They need to be able to stick their necks out.
Something your father would've come up with.
Smoke.
No, Ken. I need to see him now...
-- You listen to me. Nobody, nobody, talks about my friends that way. You're fucking here right now because of the Kennedys. They may be wrong. They make mistakes. But they're not weak. The weak ones are these 'people' who can't speak their own minds.
Yeah.
So I understand you correctly. If the missiles in Cuba were dismantled, returned to the Soviet Union, and a guarantee was made not to reintroduce them, the United States would be prepared to guarantee that it would never invade Cuba?
Mr. President, there is another possibility we haven't considered. This may not be a coup at all.
I don't know, Helen. I want you to keep the kids close tomorrow. Leave the T.V. on, sleep with it on in the bedroom until I tell you you can turn it off.
Nothing. Nothing you don't know about. Tomorrow's the big day. Just have the car ready to go if I call or if the Civil Defense Warning comes on.
I'll be evacuated with the President.
He was.
Why don't you ask him yourself? You can have him on the way home.
Today, for your information, is Pulaski Day. We're going to Buffalo...
Cheer up, you've neutralized the entire White House Press Corps for a day.
You're scared to cancel on Daly.
I know, I know...
I'm gonna protect those pilots.
Zorin must not have gotten instructions. Somebody in their Foreign Ministry's blown it big-time.
Okay, Ken. We're going.
And we do it under the table so we can disavow any knowledge of it.
And if this is a move to appease the hard line, then it may just be the bone he needs to regain control of his own house.
Sleep is for the weak, Mr. President.
You're my hero, Carl.
Don't have one, Carl. I have a number, man. Just like the numbers on those treasury checks. You stole from your own country, Carl. Shame on you.
Our police are afraid of them. Please get them out of here.
They can lead us to Jimmy. Just let them go. We're tightening the net on him. We know he's on the reservation.
The only good Indian is a dead Indian, does that old adage still hold true out here?
His mother needs a piece of his hair. It's for the Keeping of the Souls Ceremony.  Has to be kept for four days.
Get the plate numbers off everyone of these cars.
How'd you know?
One of the leaders of the Warriors of All Red Nations. Militant organization.
That's right.
She talks a lot of shit. We're not doing our job. Jimmy's innocent. "What's the FBI really doing here." Some shit about the Fort Laramie Treaty.
Let's see it.
Cooch. What's the Fort Laramie Treaty?
-- I know. I fed it, and I can't get rid of --
Well, she's running now, too. These fucking people like to run, don't --
-- if they mine uranium there, these people will have no place left to go...
No way, Cooch.
Watch out!
Bullshit.
Thank God. Now listen to me, asshole. I'm giving you a break. But if my partner finds out you're here, you're gonna be reading rat tracks in Sioux Falls Maximum Security.
He also said "listen to the water."
Go back to your DNA finger-printin'.
I see. Forgive my cultural ignorance.
I don't see the connection.
A what?
Ray --
You ain't no Indian. You're a Sal Mineo Indian.
Jesus Christ. You're hammered. What are you doing?
Oh yeah. Dreams. Sometimes durin' sickness. Vision quest. Sweat Lodge. Ya never know when.
Well, it was just a dream, I --
Sorry.
We're standin' on broken treaty ground, Ray. This ain't supposed to be here. It'll poison the water.
You're not gonna catch him. He can shape-shift into different animals. Bear. Elk. Porcupine.
-- Leo was an apple, that's right. Red on the outside, white on the inside. And Jimmy hated him. Kicked his ass a coupla times. But he didn't kill him.
Black Tail District, X22. You ready for this? Leo wasn't killed in the Badlands. I... I found the location.
Okay, Ray. I'm coming in. If he starts to leave the area, move in. And hold him. Over.
Good.
Must be a bitch getting around in that wheelchair. How long you been in it?
At Sioux Falls Pen?
Leavenworth a tough joint?
What the fuck you talkin' about?
Well, it is. It is that, too.
I could be, too.
Was there ever a girl who didn't like fighter pilots?
Yeow!
That's all!
Where were you?
Um. You.
I'm special.
Evan... or Maverick.
What are you talking about?
I don't enjoy watching things suffer.
You're not, cause you eat frozen meatballs?    Things die. Every time you breathe, you kill millions of tiny organisms. Every time you eat, something had to die.
I don't fly in anything that doesn't show movies.
. Yeah!
Maybe I shouldn't take it.
Not to me.
That's what I want.
True.
That wasn't fair. It was a question. Penalty round!
F-14's sir.
Yes sir!
I'M UP HERE TOO, MAVERICK.
No! Now we're inverted!
You'll have mine, Cougar. It'll be where your head used to be.
I GOT ONE COMING UP.
Rudder's left, stick's forward.
Okay.
You go. I'm staying with it.
The plane is fine.
Flaming Hooker. Sort of an institution around here. Or maybe this is the institution, I forget which. It's the house drink. It'll warm the cockles of your heart ... and other things depending on where you spill it.
Hey, see any controls back there?  And anyway...we beat the Son of a Bitch!
Nothing...That's McGown...that's Singer, isn't it? GOOSE Turn around, pay attention. What are you doing?
Is there anybody in the Navy you don't know?
What, been drunk? Sure! Plenty!
He should've had me. GOOSE Take it down. Let's bug out of here. Call for a draw.
Come on, relax...
Come on, we beat an instructor. How many times in your life do you get to do a victory roll?
I've had enough...for now.
I want him!
Wood's okay. I want Viper.
They should have warned you about that one.
Don't.
Well, you'll just have to make do with him .
He's a hell of a flyer. In fact, he's so damn good he might have been picked for Top Gun himself. Except for one thing.  He just can't seem to follow orders!
I didn't ruin her.
STAY WHERE YOU ARE. HE'S MINE. I'M ENGAGED. I'M IN.
YOU GOT TOO MUCH NOSE TO TAIL -- I'M COMING IN.
We did it.
So have I.
Speaking of feet, fuel's down to 4.0.  We're gonna get them wet unless we find a Sonoco station.
Didn't everybody?
How's it goin', Coog?
My wife's house.
He was by the book, all the way.
Kid, the plain fact is...you are. I'm not gonna stand here and blow sunshine up your ass. Technically, they absolved you. You and I know what really happened. You pushed it. You are responsible and you'll always carry that. You know what, I'll carry it too. I should have taken you out of that cockpit. I guess I'm a hopeless romantic... I always try to find something worthwhile in someone's death. It's no trade-off. It's not one for one. What you learned isn't worth his death. It couldn't be. But maybe there is some value in it. I know it's the first thing I've ever seen that's really gotten to you. Now the question is, what will you do with it. If it gets you out of flight status...so you don't kill yourself or anybody else...that's good. That's one good thing. You were an accident waiting to happen.
Cheap domes.  And no air to screen out the rays.
Why not?
And you get a kickback.
Take me to the hotel.
Definitely.
Get it, please.
My friend, five minutes from now, you won't give a shit about the people.  Fire it up, Doc.
No, sir.
Why not?
Sleazy...and demure.
This is going to be very difficult for you at accept, Mr. Quaid.
I'm afraid you're not really standing here right now.
Where?
Cohaagen found something weird inside, and it's got him scared shitless.
Wrong.  Kuato's a mutant.  So don't get upset when you see him.
Well don't.
A friend of mine tried one of their "special offers"...Nearly got himself lobotomized.
Yeah, you did.  I told you not to but you did anyway.
Come on, let's go have that drink.
You blabbed, Quaid!  You blabbed about Mars!
I've got him.  The guy in the turban.
Split up.  Find him.
Mmmm.....
Some men just tried to kill me!
Mars?  You've never even been to Mars.
You went to those brain butchers?!
Oh God, Doug.
The job's real. -- But the Agency set it up.
That a problem?
I'm not interested in Saturn.  I said Mars.
What about the guy you lobotomized...Did he get a refund?
You.  You're the same.  No matter where you go, there you are. Always the same old you.  Let me suggest that you take a vacation from yourself.  I know it sounds wild, but it's the latest thing in travel. We call it an "Ego Trip".
I don't wanna spoil it for you, Doug. Just rest assured, by the time the trip is over, you get the girl, you kill the bad guys, and you save the entire planet.  Now you tell me.  Is that worth three hundred measly credits?
What's he talking about?
I love you.
Blondes.
Hauser left me a note.
Because you're still working for Cohaagen.
You never loved me, Hauser!  You just used me to get inside.
I'm not sure dear?  What do you think?
Of course not.  If Mars had an atmosphere, he's lose control.
Enough for everybody to breathe?
Damn, you know, those kids turn up oil or uranium or something out there...next thing the Feds will be at our door.  "Sorry, time to move. Eminent domain."
Some kind of mutation...?
Well, who put you two in charge?
I'd vote for outer space.  No way those are local boys.
No good.  You need major four- wheel-drive just to get up that jeep trail.
Son of a bitchin' lowlife, putrid, scum...
Nope, there!  That's one.
Did it yesterday.  Franks and beans.
Hell you did.  Your turn.
Do not talk to the driver.
Why?
Well, sure.
Damn it, Val!  Not having a plan is what keeps us doing jobs like this!
You got that right.
Val!  Val!
You're hung up again.
Naw, don't want to winch it.  That'd tear it all up.  Want to lift it. Some kind of crane with lifting straps.
Yeah.  Where's your truck?
Little sons of bitches.
Maybe it is.  Why don't you take a little stroll and see?
Well, that's why Edgar never got down off that tower.
Doesn't matter.  The cat can pull <u>any</u>thing.
<u>I'm</u> best at driving the Cat.
Don't worry about me, jerkoff.
Hey, just 'cause you're no good with a rope...
I GOT A GODDAMN PLAN!!
No ties.
She just practically asked you for a date.  What the hell is wrong?!
Yeah, Val.
God, what a stink!
You don't get it, Pham.  The idea was: we were ripping you off.
Let's assume that it is.
Why do you all keep asking me?
And one good guy.
Too fine, Badalato. The bad news is, you're gonna live.
I have to talk to your brother.
-- With objection!
Sustained.
Your Honor: I imagine that, no matter how careful my questioning, Mr. Ortega would, in his well-intentioned way, dig my client's hole even deeper.
I'm a lawyer. The firm is thinking about renovating. Everything dates back to the Sixties.
I can describe it.
Not at all --
Hey. You plan to be a criminal defense attorney, know this going in: Everybody's guilty.
We're taking the other case.
Eight years ago. The Chinatown hit.
Easy? No... We have to find some piece of evidence that got buried, to reopen the sucker.
Saving it for the Sunday Times.
Chuckie's address. I sneaked a peek at the Rolodex.
That's not gonna happen. I'm gonna create reasonable doubt. Buckle your seatbelt and watch me work.
-- Roger -- ?
I've seen this picture before.
And I call your testimony hearsay. I have no more questions for you.
Have you considered that Chuckie Roeder's not calling himself Chuckie Roeder these days? Get his mugshot from one of the many law officers who've got hotpants for you... then canvass those art supplies places. We're gonna win this one, Kitty, but ya gotta believe...
I didn't put him in a wheelchair. Reynard did. He can get around without one -- it's all in my report.
Eddie, these things take time. Particularly at this hour...
Eddie, if I wanted to make love with you again, I'd do it sober.
You tell me, man.
It was self-defense.
They g-got the wrong g-guy.
Your client is guilty. Don't dick around with me.
I never joke about waiving a client's Sixth Amendment right to trial.
You know you're very tense, Mr. Reynard. Y'oughta take a week off, fly the wife and kids to Oahu.
The witness will substantiate Mr. Kim's modus operandi. It's circumstantial evidence in the case at hand!
The great personal sacrifices endured by Mr. Reynard have no bearing on the legal issues, your Honor -- !
I'd need a continuance. Three weeks at least.
Didn't this investigation, with its attendant publicity, catapult you into the office you now hold?
I didn't say he was an informant. But since you mentioned it, wasn't Esparza your primary informant?
I'll take odds on Cecil Number Two.
Shouldn't one of us...?
I knew Jimmy Chin. The boy who was shot. Okay?
That's right.
-- Why don't you ask Chuckie?
-- Roger --
Mr. Ortega... What is "La Compania"?
Soldado.
No! They g-got the wrong guy! I saw it! The killer wasn't Chinese.
The very fact that we are talking about word association means we are in a space that was opened up by our practice of word association. The world is a hologram, Albert.
Albert.
I'm glad you let me talk to you. You used to not let me talk to you.
Who are you? Who are you REALLY?
I want you to kill for me.
I want you to kill for me.
It's taken care of, babe. You and I are going to make a big score tonight.  This will tide you over.
Bobby... ssshhhh... you killed Mike.
Baby laxative? We can't snort baby laxative.
Not tonight. Just give me something to take home to hold me over till tomorrow.
Bobby...
Thanks, Bobby.  And my little round friends, too.
You're lucky I am not wasting you.
Sam, get the body and put it in the van.  Sheriff Cable, where were you the night Teresa Banks was murdered?
I am not going to Cliff's trailer.
Yep, it sure is.
That's right. That's the best coffee you're gonna get around here.
Not a lot around here, no. Got some clubs, but not very many fellas with balls.
CHET, I AM CALLING YOU FROM PORTLAND... OREGON.
OREGON. A YOUNG GIRL HAS BEEN MURDERED. SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD. NAMED TERESA BANKS.
YOUR SURPRISE, CHET. HER NAME IS LIL.
Sorry to hear it.
Did she ever mention any friends?
How come Jack let's you work here?
She only worked here a month. Nice girl. Never seemed to get here on time though. Ask me she had a little problem with --
What happened to her?
Shorthand. Really?
How do you figure?
Not Cole's Uncle but probably the sheriff's uncle in federal prison.
Right, which is probably why Lil was wearing a red wig meaning we are headed into a dangerous situation. Let me ask you something, Stanley, did you notice anything about the dress?
Gordon said you were good. The tailored dress is our code for drugs. Did you notice what was pinned to it?
That's good.
She must have known someone.
I'll get my kit.
She's wearing a ring.
May I see the magnifying glass, Agent Desmond?  There doesn't seem to be enough detail in the photo to ascertain the design on the ring.
Faulty wiring.
You didn't do your homework?
Why are you suddenly so interested in who I am going to see at night? Nighttime is my time.
Donna, you are a muffin.
Gotta go, Donna. I'll call you tomorrow.
Not you, Donna, not you.
WE got it back, that's all.
And I love you, too. But don't wear my stuff.
Cause I like it.
No... hell, no. Just got in the truck, started drivin', looked down at the gauge and saw a big "E" starin' at me.
Fill 'er up.
Yep...  Yes...  It is.
I did? I didn't see anything.
Brother, I hear you talkin'.
What does Bob say?
I couldn't it was Johnny Horne's birthday. I promised I'd be with him. I told you not to call me here.
I'm dealing with it, Doc. Big time. Maybe I'll make you a tape tomorrow. Goodnight.
Buy me a ticket to The Great Went.
How can I be together if I'm not together?
Okay.  Oh god, it's Johnny Horne's birthday today.
I can't tonight.
I just can't, James. I can't do it.
You mean the ones you pity.
What are you talking about? Bobby didn't kill anybody.
Boating?
Hiking?
Eating?
Sex?
I'm sorry, Mom.
Sure you do, it's good for you.
Good night, sweetheart.
But my name isn't Leland Palmer.
They don't call them lovers in high school, Leland.
Oh, I'll sit down, but none of us are going to start eating till Laura goes and washes her hands.
That's right.
Lay off the bennies, Leo.
Come off it, Leo. I'm late for work...
What's with that Laura? Yeah, sure, take a look around. There's no one here anyway.
Very good.
The man's an ambulance chaser...
Neither does he. That's where he loses. This man's scared to death to go to court. We only have to call his bluff.
It looks that way.
Does that mean I'm back for awhile?
I wouldn't do it.
Yes.
I... yes.
I thought I would need it.
I'm just an M.D.
'Methodology and Techniques of Anesthesiology.' Yes.
I am seventy-four years old.
...to get her heartbeat back...?
Nothing further, your Honor.
You may step down.
I was her doctor.
I doubt we'll have to go to trial...
Hold on a second.
That's what I'd planned to...
Now, Dr. Towler's testified that they restored the heartbeat within three or four minutes. In your opinion is his estimate correct?
No. No thank you, Doctor. You go home.
No. No. Thank you. You go home.
The Doctors were not negligent.
Why is that?
Is that what a good doctor would do? How old are you, please?
Easthampton Hospital for Women. Excuse me, what is that, a joke? Let me tell you something, Doctor, those men at Catherine Laboure. Men who are known not only in this city, but the world, were trying to save a woman's life. They were there, and here you are, four years later, read some hospital report, and say...
...and you're going to do that?
Yes.
I did.
Yes.
You should have taken their offer. Especially if you were unprepared.
Ready, your Honor.
Thank you, your Honor, I'll continue. Dr. Thompson. Did you examine Deborah Ann Kaye last night at The Northern Chronic Care Facility?
Damn right I'm done. I'm going to ask for a mistrial and I'm going to request that you disqualify yourself from sitting on this case. I'm going to take a transcript to the State and ask that they impeach your ass.
And are they going to get it?
Maybe what?
They, uh, they got to my witness.
Do you want me to go...?
I...
Is there going to be a later...?
What is that to you...?
Stop pressuring me...
Mr. Alito, please.
Let me talk to Mickey.
How come you're calling me from...?
My subscription lapsed three years ago...
No. At Chelsea Childcare. Okay. Look, call me Monday, hey? I'm late for work.
No.
...and I have inquiries out to doctors, experts in the field... there is, of course, a problem getting a doctor to testify that another doctor's negligent...
Yes.
He's not in, Sir.
...everybody. Mike says, 'Pat, you mean to tell me for a buck you get a free lunch and a beer, and then you go in the back and get laid?' 'That's correct.' Mike says, 'Pat. Have you been in this bar ?' Pat says, 'No, but my sister has...'  Everyone. Buy yourself one too.
Thanks, Franky.
What the hell do you think you're doing...?  What's going on here...?
...I'm going to need your help...
...he's a good man...? He's the Prince of Fuckin' Darkness... he'll have people in there testifying that the broad is well -- they saw her Tuesday on a surfboard at Hyannis... don't fuck with this case.
We've got her sister. Testifies she had a meal one hour before she was admitted to the hospital. This is the point.
I've got my Dr. Gruber, says her heart condition means they gave her the wrong anesthetic anyway, plus she came in complaining of stomach pains...
So what do you want me to do? Concannon's going to try the case his way, I'm going to try it mine. You want me to go wee wee wee all the time because he's got some flack, got stories in the newspaper. I'm going to win this case.
All right. Who wasn't in the O.R.?
We, we were rather busy...
We'd gone to 'Code Blue,' we were administering electro...
Wait, wait, wait, you're saying that her brain damage could have been caused by her being deprived of oxygen for two minutes...?
Me, too.
Wait a minute - wait a minute!.... Bombs don't unscrew.
We had a chance...We could have stopped them!  The mob stole the trucks and smashed everything up.  The fools!  They cut their own throats!
Yes...I was fishing up in the hills.
Didn't you have something to do with this?  I know you sent word to the Sixth Army Command!
I come from a big one.  Nine of us. All in Minnesota, except me.
Hours.  I've been so scared...!
They could be as curious about us as we are about them.
Yes ...  Fits better in a football helmet.
That's the kind of a kid brother you'd have!
How could it happen to everybody's watch together?
It might give us something.
Right.
From the data - and from that picture the Air Force took earlier tonight ...  ... what we've got in the gully out there is a guide ship.  One lands ... Others follow later.  They appear to clear an area, then drop in groups of threes, joined magnetically.  Is that possible?
They'll probably move at dawn.
It was nearer than that.
Well-l...how do you do, Dr. Forrester!
There's a square dance at the social hall this evening.
But they're not human!  Dr. Forrester says they're some kind of an advanced civilization --
D.O. to number three..come in.
Who?  Where d'you think they come from!
We did.  Bad mistake.  The fans are clamoring for more. So, Evil never dies, right?  Anyway, a while back we got a call from Wes.  He's got this idea.  And who better to resurrect Freddy than his creator?
I don't follow.
No biggie, really.
Okay, but it still doesn't mean it can't be over with.
Chase, it's Dylan!
Oh my God...
They are...it happened in tonight's quake.  It happened just fifteen minutes ago. You must've felt it.
He was just here!
Very well. As soon as we gather the appropriate papers...
What?
Rex?  Who's Rex?
No.  Tonight.  It's important!
Can we go get Rex, now?  The bad man's getting awful close.
Right 'cross the freeway.
Here.
I don't know why you didn't tell me, that's all.
The way he's writing is so weird, who knows?  I asked him how far he'd gotten at the funeral, and what was it he said...?  Oh yeah, as far as Dylan trying to reach God.  Weird, huh, that he'd have your kid in it?
When it is denial.  I don't think that's the case here, but if you're really worried, have a doctor check him out. You'll see, everything's fine.
That's my memory.  And it seemed absolutely real.
Steady...
Absolutely.  And how many times has Letterman called the cops thinking that woman was down in his kitchen again?  It gets under your skin if you let it.
Where's Dylan?!  Have you seen him?
No.  I...listen, I can't make it in today.
Sure.  We'll do an operation, Doctor Dylan and Doctor Julie. We'll fix him good as new.
They wouldn't let me...
What's that?
Now that you have a child, is it possible you've decided horror is bad for children?
I haven't forgotten.
He has a lot of hurt inside him.
Hey!  Weigh!  Blow the man down...
Give me some time to Blow the man down!
My instinct was to not get electrocuted.
It was an act of God for Christ's sake.
Okay.
All right.  I'm gonna wander over and look at some shoes...
No, I can't.
Gieg, Chuck.
What do you mean?
To take a piss.
What?
What was that?
Nobody says you have to be like me.
Well, and it's pretty cool too, ya know?  Bein' here together an all...
That is the point... And Skipper'll slip off the hook.
I know you will.
Forget it.
Jesus, you never told them?
What are you talking about.
Speak up boy!
Unfurl the squares!
He killed the dolphin.
Let the blow drive the boat down wind.  Neutralize our canvas.
This is a working ship.  Promptness is not a luxury, it's a necessity, as is the work to maintain her.  Had we been ready, I can assure you we would have sailed.
It will be more than that, I can promise you.
Well, we've come to give our boy a little break from the monotony.
I should be eating with the crew.
I can take care of myself.
You do?
They're in a hurry to grow up.  They don't know about consequences or responsibility.  That's being sixteen too.  I promise you one thing...
I've seen 'em.  I've seen 'em.
You know what he is talking about here?
It hurts too much to care.
Fandango, Junior.  I'm gonna do some limbo baby!!
Aaauuuhhh!!!
Except, a "White Squall".  With all due respect Captain Sheldrake, they're only boys...
I am accountable.
Don't mind him, Chucky.  You're talking to a guy whose idea of big romance is a palm full of Vaseline.
I was trying to get her up wind! That's what you do when you're hit a-beam.  Or maybe you're too stupid to know that!
How old are you?
No, he's out changin' the oil in the car.
Well... Yeah - okay.
You used the toilet, now you can go - what I do around here ain't any of your business, that's for sure.
No, haven't heard of it.
You an indian?
That's right... Take one of these.
Juana called. They're stayin' another week.
Thanks.
Actually, I'm lookin' for Marietta's daughter, Lula. Her and 'er beau took off the other day. Marietta's real upset about it.
Call me Johnnie... N.O. has always been a good town to sit around in.
United States Marine issue, before they made the unfortunate switch to the less dependable nine millimeters. I have it here, in my briefcase.
We are in the same businesses and also we are fishermen.
She's forgiven you of all these things... You love her... Don't be afraid, Sailor.
If you are truly wild at heart, you'll fight for your dreams... Don't turn away from love, Sailor... Don't turn away from love... Don't turn away from love.
I'm sorry.
He is my sponsor. The General is the head of the secret police of Honduras.
Hasta siempre.
How's that?
Now, Marietta, I am goin' to help you. And don't be gettin' carried away. You don't want to be bringin' Santos and his people into it.
This is the kinda mistake can take a Hindu's lifetime to unfix... You better get a move on, Johnnie, before that boy got her holdin' down a Memphis streetcorner and shootin' dope up her arms.
Could she be doin' okay, Johnnie? She's tryin' to prove somethin' to me, that's all. Lula ain't doin' no more'n showin' off, defyin' me...  Johnnie, I've done somethin' bad...
Just some guys I met here... I keep seein' 'em...  Now tell me...
Yeah... The one that introduced Santos to you and Clyde.
All I have to do is grab my suitcase, and I'm ready. You're lucky cause I happen to love night drivin'.
And?
Why, honey?
Peanut...
'Bout fifty thousand times. I got us a room at the Cape Fear, and guess what?... I hear Powermad's at "The Hurricane."
I guess I started smokin' when I was about six... My mama was already dead from lung cancer...
Grandmama Pace had a long, smooth white neck. It was like on a statue it was so white?
But honey, I thought you told me your Uncle Pooch raped you when you was thirteen.
Didn't he say somethin'?
No, he picked me up.
Hell, why should the Datin' Game be different from real life? At least them boys is gonna get somethin' to eat.
At Pee Dee, all you think about is the future, you know? Gettin' out? And what you'll do and what you'll think about when you're on the outside again.
Well, like mama told me, Aunt Rootie, Dell's mama? She found cockroaches in Dell's underwear.
You up for that?
Looks more like the Ghost of the Old South, but we'll try her.
Yeah, it's a real problem for me, Sailor, you know? When I went in that drugstore by the restaurant in Biloxi? I saw 'em by the register and the girl throw 'em in. I'm not big on resistin'. So what about a leech?
We sure don't, honey...  Get me a Mounds?
You really are dangerously cute, honey. I gotta admit it.
One person thinks he's doin' somethin' good and ever'body else gets upset about it.
Anythin' interestin' in the world come out of somebody's weird thoughts, Sailor. You tell me Sailor, who could come up with shit like we're seein' these days?
You certain?
It wasn't no fun, Lula. The wind was blowin' super-hard and I wasn't dressed warm. Only instead of freezin', I was sweatin' strong.
Uh huh.
Yeah.
I want to call her and tell her I'm okay. That we're okay.
Leave me be for a minute? Mama gets all insane and then I see you practicin' your individuality and personal freedom with some oil-town tramp. How you figure I'm gonna feel?
I quit workin' for 'im, but just before I did, I ended up one night at a house... I don't know what it is they all think I saw that night, but I was just sittin' out in the car till the whole place went up in flames.
Met him through Santos... Clyde - your daddy - had some sorta business deal with Santos.
My mama...  So Sailor, our histories have been somewhat intertwined.
If you say so.
You think she's gonna make it?
No, I don't think so, Sail. I just need to lie down.
I know you ain't particularly pleased bein' here.
Well, nothin' personal, but I ain't sure it's okay by me.
Few beers is all. Feelin' any better?
You talk to 'im some?...
That was in Vietnam.
Lula, I got to get some sleep.
It's a mistake, honey. You two go on. I'll walk back to the depot.
SAILOR!!!!
I'll bet.
You know who it was and you know you aren't, and I mean ARE NOT gonna see him EVER... End of story.
Don't be crazy, mama. Take care of yourself.
You ain't takin' Pace, though.
I don't understand this... I don't understand this one bit. He was supposed to meet me right her in this lobby. Somethin' bad has happened - I jus know it.
HELL NO!!! That's the last thing we need... A buncha cops runnin' around.
That's not why I called.
I want you to get rid of Sailor.
I don't need to explain anymore'n I have... You know damn well.
That's your business... I don't care how.
Santos...
No.
In the head.
Yes.
See! I knew you had it all under control.
No... But...
No...
Hey... Stop the nervous cry-baby routine... You're my girl now... Santos is gonna wipe away those tears and make you happy... Come on, let's get outta here.
There's no way in hell you can speak to her and...
I think Santos or Marietta Fortune.
Life is unpredictable.
I didn't see nothin'...
Yeah, but you gotta know what it's about, right? I mean, if you didn't know what it was about, why were you writing it?
Isn't she?
Great. I was hoping I could get a look at it sometime this weekend. Think that might be possible?
Primarily. Although I gather you two staged a little raid on the Crabtree pharmacopoeia. You missed a few bottles, by the way.
Sara and Walter declined. Guess they wanted to go home and curl up on the couch with the dog.
Come on. Crabs. Don't do this. He's one of my students, for Christ sake. I'm not even sure if he's --
He heard everything we were saying.
Just go around him.
Where would we go?
Tripp, where the hell...
What? Ohhhh. Is that... it?
Good idea, Crabs. Only one problem. I don't know where they live.
Bad enough. And God knows I don't exactly fit the new corporate profile.
I'm afraid he's pretty worn out, poor kid.
So what's the problem?
In a sense.
Hey, Jeff. If you're really interested in discussing that business with the tango, try the guy at the end of the hall.
You must be mistaken.
So I hear. You've also been smoking a lot of marijuana, I understand.
How long have you been having them?
How long have you been smoking marijuana?
A Manhattan book editor murdering a Mormon girl's clutch.
'Fraid so.
As long as it looks like her, I don't care. You know what I'm saying?
No sweat. Only do me a favor?
You're in Kinship?
Just what? Doing a little dusting?
So I'm told.
I guess. Walter never tells Sara the truth about how much he pays for these things.
He's dead, James. Believe me, I know a dead dog when I see one.
Does she want to hear it was one of her professors?
Miss Sloviak's.
She is. Ah. Here we go...
No thanks. I'm fine without them.
What's he saying?
I thought you might -- I don't know -- swallow your tongue or something.  I guess you really miss her, huh?
Who?
What'd he say?
What'd you tell him?
Well, James, you did shoot the Head of the English Department's dog and steal his most prized piece of memorabilia.
I don't know...  Me.
Yeah, well, actually...
Unless I miss my bet... my wife.
She came here. We'll just wait. In the meantime, I need you to shimmy through.
Sure you do. You were thinking: 'That's no cap gun in that kid's overcoat.' You were thinking 'I can't let that kid get on the bus alone -- he might never get on the bus again.' You were thinking: 'I've got to find a way to distract this kid.' So you did. It was -- in its way -- a noble act.
Spells? Jesus, James, you make it sound like we're in a Tennessee Williams play. I don't have spells.
When nobody's looking.
Six. Their plane went down right outside Scranton.
I'm sorry about all that. I just -- I don't like to talk about my family. They treat me like a freak.  She makes me sleep in the basement of my own house. It's mine. My parents left it to me.
That's why she hates me. That's why she makes me sleep in the basement.
Don't be. I don't care if they expel me. I probably should be expelled.
Just checking.
James'll know about George Sanders.
Do?
Crabtree said it sounded like something James would be messed up in.
That good, huh?
Chancellor.
If she's not now, Terry will make sure she is by the end of the evening.
Yes.
Is the thing -- is it over?
You love Emily. I know that. And you need to stay with her.
No. There's no way. I mean, don't you think there's no way?
Hub? Oh, well, that's part of what I need to...
Really, Sara, I...
About the baby.
Inside.
Grady.
I think I might have.
I think I might've said I was in love with you.
He told me.
Oh?
It didn't come up.
In the hospital. I was kind of excited about it at the time, but then I was on pretty heavy painkillers.
I'm your man.
James is... I don't know...
Tony. Now that I'm home.
Forget it. I should've known better. Your friend is just, I don't know, into collecting weird tricks. Mind?
What's that?
I have... eight-fifteen. That's not right, is it?
Taking the long way home.
I was thinking of you.
Oh, I don't think there's any danger of you aging prematurely, Grady.
A jockey? You mean, like --
I could be wrong. What happened anyway?
That's weird.
Yeah, you still with Northland?
I just recommended you. You still had to prove yourself.
K through sixth.
Huh?
You need a table.
It wasn't like that.
I know, man. I love this table too.  But I also love my wife.
What's that?
Maybe I'm not a good man. Maybe inside I'm bad, and I'll always be bad.
Birds.
In that birch tree is a nest.
That was terrific.
Not yet.
I'm not pretty.
Have a seat.
Okay.
They grow outside, don't they?
I fell asleep.
No.
I was asleep.
I went to bed around seven.
I could take you downtown.
I'm adjusting okay.
How come?
It sounds like you were banished.
Birds are my friends. That sounds egotistical, but they are. Birds know I watch them, but they don't mind because they like being watched... if they know you won't hurt them.
Ms. Kramer.
No need to call me doctor. I'm a therapist, not a psychiatrist.
A diary?
Ev-i-dence.
How's that?
I'm still thinking about it.
Forget it.
I don't feel anything.
If I'm not, then what the hell am I doing here?
Talking to you is like riding on a merry-go-round.
I know --
I know you're frustrated, Walter, but --
Now I know. It's when I can see a girl, be near a girl, even talk to a girl... and walk away.  That's my idea of being normal.
I'm relaxed.
In my bed, Rosen. Where do you think?
I'm maybe about six... which would make her four.
Just lying there.  We're taking a nap.
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have been there.
Yes.
I was six years old!
Accept you?
Time.
I feel... okay.
I'll buy a plant.
Sorry.
What?
Of course. Sorry. I'm such a fucking asshole.
I molested little girls.
Twelve years in prison?
No. Never again.
No. That's what I used to tell myself.
What?
You never asked them about it?
I'm not scared.
Maybe you should be.
What's it look like?
Do what?
Not when they fly.
Well, you know Lindsey, too damn aggressive-- Son of a--!!
No way that could just be seawater.
I'm alright, I'm dealing.
Missile compartment.  Those are the launch tubes.
Hey, you okay?
I... they're all dead, Bud.  They're all dead. I thought... some of them... you know...
Yeah, okay.  Okay.
Figured I was dead, there, when I seen that angel comin' toward me.
Your rig?
I'm switching off now.
No, I haven't seen him in a few weeks.
You're right, Bud.  It was just that simple. Aren't you clever?  You should get your own show... Ask Dr. Bud, advice to the lovelorn from three hundred fathoms.
No.
I can get power to this module and sub-bay if I remote these busses.  I've gotta get past the mains, which are a total melt-down.
Bud, something really important is happening here.
Bud, this is me, Lindsey.  Okay?  You know me better than anybody in the world.  Now watch my lips... I saw these things.  I touched one of them.  And it wasn't some clunky steel can like we would build... it glided.  It was the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.
It's trying to communicate.
Deepcore, this is Cab One.  We need assistance, over.  Deepcore, this--
They'll come out after us.
Calm down, Bud.
Aaargh!!  I'm freezing!
Seven, eight minute swim each way... not enough time.  Look at this...  Time I get back you'll be--
It's the only way, Bud.  Now trust me.
Monk, Schoenick... secure the package.
God, I hate that bitch.
That's it then.  Finler, McWhirter, Dietz, and Perry.  Jesus.
Yeah, for now.  Our first priority's to get something to breathe.
Why bring it here?
Yuh?
Just hold your water, okay?  So Kirkhill, we gonna do this or we gonna talk about it?
Oh... chamber runs.  Uh huh, that's good.  Well, hey... you guys know any songs?
Gimme a break!  Coffey, these things live three and a half miles down on the bottom of an abyssal trench!  Trust me... they're not speaking Russian.
What's you depth, Cab Three?
We got Russian subs creeping around.  Shit! Something goes wrong they could say anything happened down here, man.  Give our folks medals, know what I mean?
Non-Terrestrial Intelligence.  NTIs.  Yeah, I like that better then UFOs.  Although that works too... Underwater Flying Objects.
I gotta tell you, that guy scares me a lot more than whatever's down there.  A.J. Squared Away goddamn jarhead robot.  Okay, gimme a couple hours on this.
What kind of luminous things, Bud?
What's the timer set for?
Bud, it's the pressure.  Try to concentrate. Concentrate on my voice.  Just listen to my voice.
I don't know... It depends on Ettore... He's now in the process of negotiating for a contract here in Sicily...
You'll get over it soon. It's the usual anxiety.
Yes, fairly well. But I went to bed last night planning to do some thinking about a number of things ... instead, I fell asleep.
This one is gorgeous.
Because it's true. After thirty years -- not having ever spoken the truth to anyone, I should at least allow myself to do so with my own daughter.
Without any doubt, sir. If anything belonging to the girl who has run away is still here on this island...
And you say that came from Lisca Bianca?
Look... I'd like to get back to Lisca Bianca.
That must be Basiluzzo.
Well, what?
More so than the shark?
Maybe you'd better ask him.
And that's what I say, too. We could have all been killed.
But why don't you tell him?  A girl who was with us has disappeared.
Occasionally, but always with affection.
Yes.
I don't know why. I just couldn't help it.
And why did you drop them?
What do I say? What can I say? No. At least, not yet. I don't know... I can't even think of it... at a time like this... Oh, but why did you have to ask me?
So... Oh, how I wish that everything were so much simpler... that people could just come together by the color of their hair or the size of their shoes. What size shoe do you wear? Size 9. That's a very lovely size. But I'm sorry, I wear size 8.
Okay. In a few minutes.
Nothing.
Yes, she started to but I didn't feel like staying to listen to what she had to say. If we had to listen to everybody...
I don't doubt it. But at a time like this we're the least suitable persons to be with him. And as far as telephoning him... Who knows where he is?
Why?
Sleep is something one must learn to overcome. I learned how to do it when I was a child. I never slept. And I had friends who even slept less than I did. The one who went to bed first, paid a penalty. And we really didn't do anything. After seeing a movie, we'd go to a cafe and discuss things for a while... then we'd sit down on a bench somewhere... listen to some drunkard... watch them putting up posters or manifestoes...or look at the sheep passing by... or go for a stroll around the market place... Or else we'd go and wake up some girl in the neighborhood by standing in front of her window and calling out her name...
Better dead.
I would say he's pretty depraved.
But aren't you tired? I can just about manage to stand on my feet!  Raimondo!
Quieter? Oh, yes, of course.
You shouldn't always take me seriously. Actually, I'm used to it by now. First my mother and now my husband; both of them are like dynamos.
What do you mean by sensible?
I imagine he must be inside sleeping.
Please, Giulia; must you always emphasize the obvious? I can see for myself that the weather is changing.
Then let's get started... It's senseless to waste any more time.
I was saying... it might even be possible that Anna had left with them.
And you expect to find him in here? Go and ask Claudia.
I know we are. But as the years go by, we become even worse. Isn't that so, Corrado?
Here I am.
But how could they pose like that? I couldn't.
But I want to paint you. You appeal to me more.
I tell you this acquaintance of mine knows you and she has often spoken to me about you.
But for you, what comes first: music or love?
Unfortunately, no.
Claudia isn't coming with us. Will you please take care of her luggage? Thanks.
He talked to you Himself?
Who?
Why?
Why?
Agnes dear, Heaven is not a place where...
Who?
Why?
It made them holy.
It's not that... it's not that...
I don't know. I don't know what happened Mother, I woke up... there was blood on the sheets, but I don't know what happened.  I don't know what I did wrong, I don't know and I should be punished.
Yes.
Hasn't anyone ever told you that before?
What would you like to talk about.
Anything... may I sit down?
Yes.
I love you.
Yes.
Oh, yes!
Did it hurt?
Is that where they say it came from... ?
Where'd it come from before that?
After God... before the waste-paper basket.
Then let's talk about something else...
Would you like to ask them?
Martha Louise Livingston.
No, only when she felt like it. She brought me up here last winter and the next day she died.
I get headaches. Mommy did too... oh, but she wasn't stupid. She knew things that nobody else knew.
She knew what was going to happen to me. That's why she hid me away.
Somebody told her.
You'll laugh.
An angel, when she was having one of her headaches.
No, but I can never tell her that.
Because I don't want one.
Everything... I don't have children.
Everyone's unhappy, you're unhappy aren't you?
She can.
Her headaches.
I'm afraid.
Yes I am.
Of what?
May I open my eyes now?
I left early because I wasn't feeling very well.
Above the bed?  Any... anything else? What do you you see, something different?  What is it?
What do you do?
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Who?
Where?
Yes.
Agnes... Agnes...
She... left me alone with that little thing, and I looked at it, and I thought this is a mistake. But it's my mistake, not Mommy's. God's mistake.
What?
Nobody is interested in sending a nun to prison.
You got to be crazy.
I don't believe this. I don't bloody believe this.
You're getting to all of us Martha, let's face it.
I can get you new evidence next week.
Marie brings me icecream too you know. Chocolate... my favourite.
Well that's a lot of land. You must have help. Do you have field hands that help you?
Sister Anne, which was Agnes' room?
Well you're probably right about that. It certainly can't help Sister Agnes to have this investigation continued for any length of time.
Who told you this?
What business is it of yours..?
... Thank you.
Believe me, I've done everything possible short of asking Agnes.
Well I'm the doctor. I'm the one who's going to decide what is, or is not important here.
That she was unconscious, yes!  So someone easily could have come in the room and killed the...
That possibility never occurred to you?
It was healed by the following morning and she started eating again...
And she has a right to know that there's a world out there filled with people who don't believe in God...  ... and aren't any worse off than you Mother. People who've gone through their entire lives without bending their knees once, to anybody. And people who fall in love and have babies and occas- sionally are very happy. She has a right to know that. But you and your... your order and your Church have kept her ignorant...
No, you're shielding her. Let her face the world.
There's another choice.
Yes.
She drank too much. That's what killed her.
Because I didn't know... 
And what has that to do with it?
So you left the Church because you had freckles?
No, it reminds me.
All right?
Saint Peter?
There are no saints today. Good people yes, but extraordinarily good people... those I'm afraid we are sorely lacking.
Yes I do.
You think she's a saint?
My God, you're as crazy as...
You're saying God did it?
Then why are you so obsessed with her? You're losing sleep over her?  You're thinking about her all the time. You're bent on saving her. Why?
Who?  That tun... that tunnel hasn't been used in fifty years.
Where is she?
I wanted her to have it when no-one else was around, they would have taken the baby to a hospital and left it with them, but it was such a difficult birth, there was so much blood and I panicked.
Agnes, what happened to the baby?
Wasn't it!
Yes, they were playing the queues outside the picture palaces of Liverpool. Scruffy young lads, lacking even the price of a jam roll. Orphans, every Paddy's son of 'em. I saw their potential at once although I had me doubts about the little fella, a savage primitive, that Ringo, but it was him what gave in first. He picked up a brick and heaved it at me and I quelled him wid one fierce flash of me eyes. "Mister, can you spare us a copper?" he said. I was disarmed by the grubby little outstretched mauler ... So, I took them under me managerial banner.
Oh, not at all, I let them have twenty-five; sure aren't there four of them?
All right, take your hoop and bowl.
Are you now?
Just you?
Yeah?
How about Ding Dong?
Yeah.
Please do, I'll not need them for fifteen minutes. Thank you.
Well, that's the wrong line for a start.
Eh ... don't call him sir, he's got enough delusions of power as it is.
I wouldn't be seen dead in them. They're dead grotty.
And who's this Susan when she's at home?
Have I said something amiss?
Wake up!
You crawler.
I've got you worried, haven't I?
D'you know something, "They" don't worry me at all. Anyroad, I only fancy listening to you ... that's all but if it worries you ... well ...
Don't mench ... well, why don't you give us a few more lines, like?
I'm not ...
Aye, it is but as long as you get by, it's all right, you know ... bash on, happy valley's when they let you stop. Anyroad, I'd better get back.
You can learn from books.
Yeah ... funny really, 'cos I'd never thought of it but being middle-aged and old takes up most of your time, doesn't it?
Is there a fire, then?
Eh?
Hello.
I'll look after meself.
Before you go, I think it's only fair to warn you about me Grandson ... don't let our Paul have his own way all the time, 'cos if you do he won't respect you!
It's your nose, y'see. Fans are funny that way. Take a dislike to things. They'll pick on a nose...
A harmless bit of fun, aah, none of you have any sense of humour left these days.
You're left-handed, aren't you, Paul?
We've just finished, Pauly. Hey George, write us your John Henry on this picture.
Aye, come on, honest, that grandfather of yours is worse than any of you lot.
Hiding.
Well ... everyone's entitled to two, aren't they, and this is me other one.
Well, me mother thought the trip 'ud do him good.
He's got you worried, then?
Don't be callous.
Oh, it's a laugh a line with Lennon.  Anyroad up ... It's all your fault.
Like what?
Eh, don't take out me lines.
Nothing, he's trying to brainwash me and give me personality doubts ... oh, he's a swine but a clever swine, mind.
You needn't bother.
That's right, but he's only asking us to pay attention to him, aren't you?
You're a swine, isn't he George?
We were going to do it.
What?
No, not me.
No, I'm not.
I'm not, no.
Oh yes.
I would have said so.
Oh, leave off!!!
He'll get over it.
Don't exaggerate.
Aren't we ...
When I tell you to stay put, stay put.
Not exactly, just feel like somebody's been beating me with rubber hoses for about six years.
... I don't know...
Sandy, scan the whole sky.
Dell, plot our location.
Yeah.  Two hours.
No, you'll follow me.
But functioning.
You want to try?
Yeah, but this is hard work.  Can't talk now.
Don't remember nothing.  Can't hardly remember my name.
I think that's a pretty reasonable request.
I have intercepted a transmission of unknown origin.
It is none of the 678 dialects spoken by technological man.
I have a temporary sequence on the monitor --
Has the hull been breached?
It's monstrous -- it grew, like some horrible tapeworm.  We were completely unprepared.
What was that?  What the Christ was that?
The water will still recycle.
-- And the cooling unit on the other.
Right.
Here, let me try.
We could put on our pressure suits and blow all the air out of the ship.  That would kill it.
I hope not.
You can't tell -- that kind of stuff could represent printed circuits...
Ask him.
How could anything be indigenous to this asteroid?  It's dead.
The door was closed.  It must still be in here.
Still unconscious?
Good.  Get on it.  But first, I'm issuing a standing order: from this moment forth, every one of us will wear protective garments, including helmets.  Let's get down to the locker and change.
How do we locate the creature?
It's time for drastic remedies.
Good!  That's good!
Whoever's doing the herding is gonna have their hands pretty full.  I think somebody should stay by the lifeboat to slam the door on the thing once it's inside, and to serve as... as... 
I'm trying.
We're not going anywhere.
We can't spare the personnel.  We've got minimum takeoff capability right now.  That's why Chaz left us on board.
We can use the flamethrower.
I should hope so!  And we'd better make sure it's pretty far from the ship when we blow it.
Is it armed?
Sorry.  Nothing but that same damn transmission, every 32 seconds.  I've tried every frequency on the spectrum.
Help me -- I'm going to try to get it off.
Is it still dripping?
Primitive pictorial languages are based on common objects in the environment, and this can be used as a starting point for translation...
Well, I kind of hate to point it out, but all our supplies are based on us spending a strictly limited amount of time out of suspended animation... and as you know, we used up most of that time in harvesting.
Time and space have no meaning out here.  We're living in Einsteinian equation.
Are they close?
Let's get moving with this net.
All right, then -- when it gets to the other side of the door, you sing out, then drop the door.  Okay?
And you and I will bag it, and then we'll take it to the ventral air lock, got it?
Right.  Fire up all systems.
Sandy, contact traffic control.
Chaz, I've got something here on my security alert.  A high priority from the computer...
Well, it's finally happened.
Any microorganisms?
Anything else?
Good.  I'm getting you clear too. Let's just keep the line open.
I agree.  This is the single most important discovery in history.
Yeah, we hear you!  We're coming back!
Chaz, if it's an organism, and we let it in, the ship will be infected.
They seem native to the planet.  It's got an atmosphere and a dense gravity.  It's dead now, but once it must have been fertile.
Let's take her into an escape orbit.
Right now let's keep it closed.
By eating our food supplies.
... More spores coming.
Can we get to him?
That kind of remark is pointless. Now come on -- I want to hear every suggestion you can come up with, no matter how wild.
Okay.  First we shut down all the cooling systems on the stardrive engines.
Sure.
Bloody big if it is.  Top's open.
Nah.  I just wanna squeeze off a few rounds.  'Sides, they tagged the rhinos for the migration project, so they're protected.  They'll dock you a month's pay for just mentioning it.
Yep...
We're what!?
We're not gonna make it, are we?
What?  What's wrong?  What is it?
Keep trying!
Match it!
The door's sealed from inside.  Doc Revna's in there, and it sounds like Ackland's going nuts.
About thirty minutes.  Those are slimmed-down tanks, so no stopping to admire the scenery.
We've dumped the whole data-base from one of the cleaning remotes into the helmet. It'll project the route through the sewer system onto the inside of the glass as you go.
One more sweep... one more sweep.  I'm getting tired of one more fuckin' sweep. We're been lookin' for this thing for three days now, and found zip.
That's what I mean.  This is the quietest I've ever heard it.  It's unnatural.
C'mon De Vries.  Think of the bonus.
Just behind us, over to the right.
No, he's stopped; he's totally still. Just take it nice and easy, babe. Nice and easy...
Okay.
Auto-shop?
How tight are these shafts?
Blow those suckers, Driscoll!
How long you been out here for now, anyway?  Three months?
Real man' drink.
Do you think Ackland'll sit tight?
Check out the tent.
Yeah, 'Good Evening' to you, too.
Phoebe.
I call myself Phoebe.
Certainly, Mr. deWitt...
You're more than kind. But it's still Miss Channing's performance. I'm just a carbon copy you read when you can't find the original...
I discussed it very openly. I told her that I had spoken to Lloyd - and that he was interested.
It wasn't meant to be.
Frankly - yes.
Not with me, you're no champion. You're stepping way up in class.
Then if you won't get out, I'll have you thrown out.
What of it?
I was there, I saw you and heard you through the dressing room door!
You can have one at Max's.
That's how you met me. In passing.
Like I just swam the English Channel. Now what?
Gable. Why a feller like that don't come East to do a play...
It's new Margo. But she's just as late as the old one.
Dear Margo. You were an unforgettable Peter Pan - you must play it again, soon. You remember Miss Caswell?
Miss Caswell, at the moment, is where I can lend no support - moral or otherwise.
Being violently ill to her tummy.
I consider it highly unnatural to allow a girl in an advanced state of pregnancy-
Completely. Nor, I am sure, could anyone else present tell you how Miss Caswell read or whether Miss Caswell read or rode a pogo stick.
How nice for Lloyd. And how nice for Eve. How nice for everybody.
The air lines have clocks, even if you haven't! I start shooting a week from Monday - Zanuck is impatient, he wants me, he needs me!
Where?
Geniuses don't need good luck.  I do.
Thank you so much.
Show me a human and I might have!
Like a nylon lemon peel-
Eve. I'd forgotten they grew that way...
Did she tell you about the Theater and what it meant?
I understand they've got the Indians pretty well in hand...
Everybody can't be Gregory Peck.
How childish are you going to get before you quit it?
Sing it?
Cut it out.
I thought you were going to be late-
That never stopped you before.
She's a girl of so many rare qualities.
Clyde Fitch, thought you may not think so, was well before my time!
- guilty.
Nothing, really...
If my guests do not like it here, I suggest they accompany you to the nursery where I'm sure you will all feel more at home.
Eve?  How enchanting...  Wherever did you get the idea of having Eve read with Miss Caswell?
So full of meaning, fire and music!
What a body, what a voice.
Now don't get carried away-
I am sick and tired of these paranoiac outbursts!
I've been aware of that for some time.
You've had so many reasons for not wanting to marry me... Margo, tell me what's behind all this.
I think you do know but you won't or can't tell me.  I said before it was going to be my last try, and I meant it. I can't think of anything else to do. I wish I could.  We usually wind up screaming and throwing things as the curtain comes down. Then it comes up again and everything's fine. But not this time.  You know there isn't a playwright in the world who could make me believe this would happen between two adult people. Goodbye, Margo.
Glory Hallelujah.
You know what I'm going to be?
I just asked a simple question.
Also Addison deWitt.
You didn't have to tell me.
Are you proud of me, Bill?
You shouldn't have had any doubts.
I never played Fort Sumter.
Oh, brother.
Imagine. All this admiration in just one room.
See you home...
Just because you can't even work a zipper. It was very thoughtful, Eve, and I appreciate it-
Oh-oh.
Do you want an argument or an answer?
No.
Like an agent with one client.
You're not being funny, I could get actors for less. What about the food?
I - I guess I fell asleep.
You rest. I'll get it...
You're Margo Channing's best friend. You and your husband are always with her - and Mr. Sampson... what's he like?
He's the best.
Oh, no...
Not at all.  Margo, this is Eve Harrington.
I'd do much more - for a part that good.
Thank you, Karen.
I was dreadful, Miss Channing, believe me - I have no right to be anyone's understudy, much less yours...
San Francisco. It was the last week. I went one night... the most important night in my life - until this one. Anyway... I found myself going the next night - and the next and the next. Every performance. Then, when the show went East - I went East.
Well - if I'm not in the way...
Well, teacher's away and actors will be actors...
When he gets too close, I'll spit in his eye.
Well, you've done so much... what's new?
Eve...  ... by any chance, did you place a call from me to Bill for midnight California time?
I wouldn't like.
Why not?
Hi.  "Well, now Mis' Channin', ah don't think you can rightly say we lost the wah, we was mo' stahved out, you might say - an' that's what ah don' unnerstand about all these plays about love-stahved Suth'n women - love is one thing we was nevah stahved for the South!"
It's just that you get me so mad sometimes... of all the women in the world with nothing to complain about-
You've what?
I was telling Margo and Lloyd about how often you'd seen the play...
We've all seemed a little tense lately...
Silly, isn't it? You'd think they'd fix it so people could just sit in a car and keep warm...
I just can't believe it.
The critics thought so, the audiences certainly think so - packed houses, tickets for months in advance - I can't see that either of Lloyd's last two plays have hurt you any!
That book is out of print, Karen, those days are gone. Fans no longer pull the carriage through the streets - they tear off clothes and steal wrist watches...
In a minute...
Up to here! That's where I've got it - up to here! Of all the star ridden, presumptuous, hysterical-
Of course she knew! For one thing, Addison told her how superbly Eve had read the part-!  Karen, let me tell you about Eve. She's got everything - a born actress. Sensitive, understanding, young, exciting, vibrant-
What is?
That's quite a change of subject.
With gestures, of course.
They'd die without each other.
Margo!
Old wives' tales, born of envy and jealousy! And a phobia against truth!
... Among so many quiet qualities.
Too many. And you've got a new guest. A movie star from Hollywood.
Week after week, to thousands of people, you're as young as you want...
You'd have been proud of her.
Too bad.
You know, she probably means well, after all...
This is real cooperation. I appreciate it.
Margo, I wouldn't think of taking that girl away from you...
Well...
I promise.
I was sure trying.
What, though?  It can't be the Republicans--he'd never allow something as stupid as this, not when he's gonna slaughter McGovern anyway.
Hmm.
--Hunt doesn't seem like your ordinary consultant.
I met a Presidential aide once at a social occasion.
Why didn't we get that?
It was there. I just don't get it; a CREEP secretary being scared, that's one thing. But what does the wife of one of the most powerful men in America have to be afraid of...?
And I'm a Republican.
When?
Nixon.
You voted for him.
--Colson.
We'd like to wait til we have all five before we print it.
--shit--
--I haven't said anything--
So maybe Watergate wasn't really about Watergate--maybe that was just a piece--
--he said John Haldeman, not Bob Haldeman--
--to become President Nixon's campaign manager on March 1, Mitchell personally approved withdrawals from the fund--
And you will.  But not now.
That's right.
You can't.
I've got a lot of energy.
They never told me anything except my own role--I had to find out the rest in the papers.
Oh, maybe nickel and dime stuff.
It gets interesting if it was Haldeman, because our word is that when Chapin says something, he's gotten the OK from Haldeman, and when Haldeman says something, he's gotten the OK from the President.
At USC, you had a word the this-- screwing up the opposition you all did it at college and called it ratfucking.  Ever wonder if Nixon might turn out to be the biggest ratfucker of them all?
--so?
--yes--
And?--
--Deep Throat?--
Just let me get a match.
...No... never in so many words...
Could buy a lot of steaks, 350,000 dollars.
Which people?
--omigod, there was so much of it, six million came in one two-day period-- six million cash, we couldn't find enough places to put it. I thought it was all legal, I guess I did, til after the break-in, when I remembered Gordon got so much of it.
A Miami D.A. The guy doing the investigating is named Martin Dardis. 
Do you think the truth will come out at the trial?
I'm not your source on that.
--all non-denial denials--we're dirty guys and they doubt we were ever virgins but they don't say the story is inaccurate.
--his dialing finger must be falling off--
Look, I told you inside--
Absolutely--Marilyn's gotten it totally wrong--
--I've completely forgotten where it was, except I know it wasn't her apartment.
I see. And how do you think it reached Miami?
I don't know maybe sixteen, eighteen hours a day--we've got sources at Justice, the FBI, but it's still drying up.
I did everything you said, but it all seemed--
Who?--be specific. How high up?
Did you change cabs?  It didn't work, something moved there--
Why didn't they?--who told them not to?
Total manipulation. I suppose you could say they wanted to subvert the Constitution, but they don't think along philosophical lines.
--don't you miss the grand scheme too.
--yes, yes, what is it?
Good God!
Government. Recently retired.
I think so.
That's everything Bachinski had, I think it's worth following up.
You can't believe that.
Lotsa hints--
The most powerful man in America is President Nixon, probably you've heard his name.
Could develop.
One thing I'm not completely clear on--when you gave out the money to Liddy, how did that work?
No, none of those.
The what to what?
I'm not Miss Abbott.
Sorry.
Okay then.  The rest of you okay with that?
Thanks coach.
Finch, you can be the one to date a nearly-dead insane chick.  Eat your damn imitation hot dog.
When was the last time you looked at the facilities here?
As if there were any alternative in the matter.  Are you enjoying yourself?
I believe the kegs are upstairs.
Yep.
Charming.
You?  You think I don't get that? God, it's like just because I don't get drunk and barf every weekend, people say "Oh, here's this goody-two- shoes choir-girl priss."
Forget it.
Neither will I.
I'm glad you think so.
I saw you making fun of me with your lacrosse buddies.
You talked to Stifler?
What's that?
Yeah but, no offense, you're talking about a post-high school, long- distance relationship, and you and Kevin haven't even done it yet.
Of course he does.  What about you? Have you just never had one with Kevin -- or have you never had one, period?
Well, if you want to get her in the sack, tell her you love her.  That's how I was duped.
I do, baby, I do.
Uh...
You can crash at Stifler's?
You know, I've never got that shit. What exactly constitutes third base?
Pontificated.
Their tiger-style kung-fu is strong; but our dragon style will defeat it!
Went home to shit.
Holy shit!
You fuckin' rule!
Nothing!
It's not what it looks like!
Really?  You seriously want to go with me?
Highly, highly overrated.
Yes!  And he was such a dork!  And everyone laughed at me, but I didn't care?  Because it was so funny!
Oh!  And then this one time?  At band camp?  I stuck a flute in my pussy.
Don't you want me to?
No -- Kevin, you?
Oh that's really reassuring.  And don't call me Nova anymore.  I'm a fraud.
Oh -- no way.  I can't do that to her.
Hang in there, buddy, you'll get there.
Strip?
Yes...James, it is knowing that these beautiful women arouse you that arouses me...
God dammit, Stifler!
No, I'm not.  I'm writing a sequence of random numbers that look like I'm doing the extra credit problems.  Mr. Bender doesn't bother to check homework past April.
No, I don't not love you.  I like, I know that we've definitely got <u>something</u> between us.  Something good. Something special.
Yeah, we have something great, Vick.
Yeah, right here.
I don't know.  How do you?
Don't say that, we can do it somehow. It might not be perfect, but --
What?  Not <u>the</u> Bible?
Uh...I thought you might know a trick or something.  To make her, you know...
Oh shit dude, the L-word!
Then where does a blowjob figure in?
No shit, I'm never gonna get laid. How the hell am I gonna become this Mr. Sensitive Man?
Dude, prom sucks.
I can't, I have no idea how he's doing it.  And that leaves you trailing, Jim.  You gotta get your act together.
Stifler!!
Depends if my date wants to stop by.
Keep it down, dude.
Uhh! Would you die already!
Just like sex with my wife.
You try to be a good sport, and look what happens.
Yeah. Apparently.
Hope I didn't hurt him too bad.
AHHHHHHH!
What, all of a sudden you got a degree in supernatural law?
Oh, big man. You can beat up a couple of cadavers. Well let me make something real clear, asshole. If you don't kill yourself, at midnight tonight you're gonna transform and murder innocent people!
Hey, Sorry if I was out of line.
Fine. My mistake. You know, I'm gonna be a writer myself some day.
Come on. I'm from New York - the "shoot me" state. Don't wait up.
You must get out of here. It's not safe.
Um... sort of... Maybe... It's all kind of blurry. We met at the club, then... Damn, that was some weird shit.
Hey, what more could I want? I survived my first and last hallucinogenic hellride, and neither of us is dead. I'd say I feel almost as great as you look.
So's Woody Allen.  No, your uncle really helped me. I was sort of messed up for a while. Wasting my time just partying and... just stupid shit. He kind of woke me up, gave me a job, got me taking classes.  You know, he and Claude, their work is controversial, but they're serious about it. Totally dedicated.
Are you okay?
I had to be a damn Hemingway hero. Well I'll tell ya, the old man and the sea didn't go through half this shit.
I told you. He already tried to contact me once. If you saw his face... He was desperate to tell me something. I owe him this.
Yeah. French fries...
What...?
No. We have to try. We'll figure something out. And if midnight comes before we can get to him, well, then we go together. Deal?  Shake a paw?
All your weapons, on the floor! Now!
What?
Well, they are French.
Let's go from both ends. We'll cut him off.
Shhh! Be quiet, man! We're not alone -
Go ahead Serafine. Blow him away.
You think it's silly. But do you realize that young man is actually in a deep sleep?
Why the fuck would I do that?
What?... Oh, right, you can see these guys too. Jesus... 
Yes. I was able to decode the old texts and give Terrence the specifications. It took a lot of trial and error, but finally he got it: Adenine Di-Methyloxide. ADM. I call it ADAM. But just before he was attacked, he hid it...
Right. Listen, my uncle, it's not serious is it? Did he eat some bad snails? Slip on the bidet? What?
Vegetable, right. My mistake. It seems he was attacked by a maniac, maybe two or three maniacs, just after midnight. yesterday. They fled into the tunnels beneath Paris, that's all we know...
Well, here's what I think happened. A chemistry professor goes to a bad part of town late at night. Why? Perhaps he's making a few francs on the side. The psychedelic drug market is big these days. He gets mixed up with a bad crowd and, like they say, if you lie with dogs, you get fleas.
I'm telling you. It's not drugs. It's something more. Someth -
You fucking liar!
He says -
Your uncle was carrying this. The keys to his apartment are in there. I talked to his assistant, Madame Flocquet. You'll be staying there a while?
I know, but I had to because . . .
But what if we can't ever find where we came from?!
I'm fine.
You must have.
Yes, your highness.
Yes, your highness.
That's a good idea - a great idea - stretch your legs  ... stretch then that way.
Trying... to... breathe...
It's not you - it's the dress!
Well, the only thing you've got when you've got a home is a fear of losing it! You're lucky you don't remember the revolution -- I never had much, but what I did have -- I lost.
I'll never let go!
Bartok... a question.
What do you think is the most humiliating way to die?
We will.  We <u>have</u> to.  Come on, Vlad - she's out there.
That was your dinner!  I do hope there is no cabbage in Paris!
"Wake up, your highness" - we should start getting used to saying it.
Pray he's color-blind...
It worked in Odessa...
Watch me.
The same thing I wanted ten years ago - all the Romonovs dead I got the others, now I have to finish up with that nuisance, Anastasia...
STOP IT! I DID SO KILL THEM! And I'm going to kill Anastasia.
Remove him at once.
After all I've done for your family - YOU TRIED TO KILL MEEEEEE ! ! !
Oh, heavens - I must say, yes.
Oh, heavens, no... but ...  She is going to be at the Ballet Russe tonight! That's the Russian Ballet - Russe for Russian, oh those crazy French... they only go to see which dancers will defect.
You wouldn't know it. It doesn't matter. What's the difference?
Once in a while, you know. I mean, you know, every now-
What?
M'mm.
Well, you only give me books with the word "death" in the title.
Who are you?
Yes.
that I've got to... ah... ah... They're gonna laugh at him for a couple minutes, then I gotta go out there, I gotta ... get laughs, too. How much can they laugh?  They-they they're laughed out.
Yeah? Allison what?
If they-they recovered the shells from that rifle.
You're using this conspiracy theory as an excuse to avoid sex with me.
Okay.  Please, I have a headache, all right?
No, I'm sorry, I can't do it. We- we've blown it already. I-you know, uh, I-I can't go in in the middle.
You know what a hostile gesture that is to me?
Hey, you... everybody in line at the New Yorker has to know our rate of intercourse?
I-I-I mean, I'm comparatively normal for a guy raised in Brooklyn.
What-what-what-what's the matter?
It's always some kind of an excuse. It's- You know, you used to think that I was very sexy. What... When we first started going out, we had sex constantly... We're-we're probably listed in the Guinness Book of World Records.
Okay, it's in. It's definitely in the pot!
Yeah. I'm gonna get my... I'm gonna get my camera.
All right, here! Oh, God, it's disgusting!
Oh... no, no, no, no, uh, uh. No.
Hey, that was last year.
Uh, don't worry, I'm a very-  a very good driver.  So, listen-hey, you want some gum, anyway?
Yeah. I got, uh, I got a license but I have too much hostility.
Huh? Oh... yeah.
Yeah.
Hey, well, listen... hey, you wanna come upstairs and, uh... and have a glass of wine and something? Aw, no, I mean... I mean, you don't have to, you're probably late and everything else ...
Yeah, uh, I'm gonna give him one more year and then I'm goin' to Lourdes.
Right. Well, I don't know, I mean, uh, some of her poems seem - neat, you know.
Narcolepsy, right, right. Right. So, anyway, so...  George, uh, went to the union, see, to get his free turkey, be-because, uh, the union always gave George this big turkey at Christmas time because he was...  shell-shocked, you know what I mean, in the First World War.  Anyway, so, so...  George is standing in line, oh, just a sec... uh, getting his free turkey, but the thing is, he falls asleep and he never wakes up. So, so...  so, he's dead ...  he's dead. Yeah. Oh, dear. Well, terrible, huh, wouldn't you say? I mean, that's pretty unfortunate.
'Cause I don't like to get naked in front of another man, you know-it's, uh...
Well, uh...  You're what Grammy Hall would call a real Jew.
Yeah, yeah, I sorta dabble around, you know.
Oh, I'm sorry, wait a minute, I have something. Well, what about Saturday night?
Yeah, I meet a lotta jerks, too.
You're gonna sing? Do you sing? Well, no, it isn't  No kidding?  this is my first time. Oh, really? Where? I'd like to come.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no! No, I'm interested!
No, they didn't. You have a wonderful voice.
Yeah.
No, no, I-I-i, uh, I don't use any major hallucinogenics because I took a puff like five years ago at a party and
I tried to take my pants off over my head...  ...my ear.
Yeah?
M'hm.
M'hm. Yeah. Yeah.
Unbelievably sexy. Yes, you are. Because... you know what you are? You're-you're polymorphously perverse.
Do I love you?
Yeah.
Well, I mean, I'm moving in with you, that's why.
I guess you think that I talked you into something, huh? 
No, no, no, what... You can once, you can live without it once. Come on.
U-huh.
Let's just do it, all right?
Yeah, but that's not-that's no good. I want the whole thing.
so if I get a laugh from a person who's high, it doesn't count. You know-'cause they're always laughin'.
Hey, what is this-an interview? We're supposed to be making love.
Following is different. I was spying.
What's the difference? It's all mental masturbation.
Yeah?
That's amazing. I-I-I... I've been goin' for fifteen years, I-you know, I don't got... nothing like that in-
Yeah?
Will it change your wife?
And, Alvy... and then I told her about how I didn't think you'd ever really take me seriously, because you don't think that I'm smart enough.
A bit rapidly. I don't care what you say about David, he's a perfectly fine teacher!
No.
I got the good chocolate, Alvy.
It really is lovely. It's in the bathroom.
It's for my complexion.
Oh, yeah. Oh.  Oh! Alvy?
I don't know.
Hey, can yuh watch the road? Watch the --
Holy cow!
Oh, the thing! Oh, the thing...  ...yeah... yeah.
I don't know, I thought it might be kind of fun, you know what I mean, it'd be nice to meet some new people.
And... I don't know... I mean, six months ago I-I woulda done it. I woulda done it, just to please him.
But the thing is-I mean, since our discussions here, I feel I have a right to my own feelings. I think you woulda been happy because... uh, uh, I really asserted myself.
Yeah, I know it's sick, but it's new. You know, you didn't say it couldn't be sick.
I'm nauseous.  Oh, jesus, now I don't get to do the TV show?
Nothing at all?
Yeah, and gradually you get old and die. You know it's important to make a little effort once in a while.
Well, uh, Alvy, you wanted to break up just as much as I do.
Yeah, and I-I tru- you know, I trust her, because my-my analyst recommended her.
Right. And you-and you know what the beauty part is?
That's right, that's right.  You only gave me books with the word "death" in the titles.
You're mad, aren't you?
I'm late.
You mean they give awards for that kind o' music?
You should be ashamed of yourself.
Hey, you wouldn't believe this. Two minutes ago, the Knicks are ahead fourteen points, and now...  they're ahead two points.
I can't.
You have a raccoon?
I mean, d- He can give you- Do you hafta give it so loud? I mean, aren't you ashamed to pontificate like that? And- and the funny part of it is, M- Marshall McLuhan, you don't know anything about Marshall McLuhan's... work!
Oh, do yuh?
Let's get the hell outta this crazy city.
Right, Max, forget it. Aren't you gonna be late for meeting Annie?
Great, but nobody laughs at it 'cause your jokes aren't funny.
I don't know, I mean, I-
V.P.L.?
I'll handle it. I'll handle it. Hi.
You're an actor, Max. You should be doing Shakespeare in the Park.
Oh, God, you should've seen what I looked like then.
Then there was Jerry, the actor.
Hey, listen-I mean, he was a terrific actor, and look at him, he's neat- looking and he was emotional... Y- hey, I don't think you like emotion too much.
I'll have the usual trouble with Annie in bed tonight. Whatta I need this?
Oh, yes, yes.
You think so? Do you really?
Uh, we just wanted to stop by and say that we really enjoyed your sets.
No, I don't-I don't know, but I-I know your work. I'm a big fan of yours.
I don't know, this is strange to me, you know.
Oh yeah, stay here? U-huh.
Very well.
You should talk to Mr. Joe.
I'm not that good.
And you've only just met.
Not this time.
What?
You think so!?  I've been working out a lot since the baby. And I've been working.  And that takes it's toll, you know.
Pictures.  They're always in my tote.  I left my tote in the damn trailer.  But! He's Mac all over again.  Imagine Mac shrunk to two-and-a-half feet.  The fact is they probably didn't even need me for this birth.
I love her too, Joe.
Yeah.
Anymore.
Shit, I forgot to call her back.  She's off on a trip somewhere.  Oh God, my grandad's flat in London's been sold.
I should have damn well bought it.  Well, we can't afford it.  The movie's going to eat up a year of my life and I'm getting paid next to nothing.  Do you know how much Skye Davidson's getting?  Four million.
Lucy overdosed.
Monica.
Let me heal you, baby.
Hm.  We should do it again.
Hm.  You think we should ask them for their landscaper?
I don't think so.
I know.  I know that.  Don't spoil it.
We couldn't be on more solid ground.
Did you invite them?
That was the plan.  And you're thrilled to have them.
Did you tell Joe to behave?
Hardly...
No.  I missed that.
For good.
I'll say as little as possible.
You've got Cal.  You've got Gina.  You've got Skye?  We're the leftovers.
Truce?
Sally, so I took a few pills.  I went out dancing.  I tried to forget how upset I was about splitting up with you.  I haven't lied to you.  I told you about the people I've slept with.  I just didn't mention the few occasions I took drugs because you're so fucking judgmental I knew I'd never hear the end of it, and you have so little faith and so little trust in me.  Sally, we're back, I love you.  Trust that.  Please let's not do this.
Love?
That hasn't the first fucking thing to do with love.  It's whether we can live together... like this!  All the time.
Every novel I've had published in every language I've dedicated to Lucy.
Who the fuck do you think you are?  The part of Genna is not just about you. It's about every woman I've ever loved in my entire life.  Including my mother. The character is also clearly in her early twenties, Sally.
Sally, I have never considered you for this part because you are too old to play it.  And you are out of touch with reality if you think differently.
You're not ready.
I wasn't part of that picture at all, was I?  I wasn't part of that decision.  Did I occur to you at all?  It's a fucking farce.  It's a fucking farce.  How long did you think you could keep it going. You're amazing.  Do you have any idea what you've done to us?
Me too.
He's my favorite.
Will you make love with me?
I don't know why Joe, we've known each other how long...
Don't be silly.
Yes I know.  I started to say... I started to say Joe that --
Right away.  Are you sure you wouldn't like something soft, Ryan?
Oh.
Very well put.
Alright.  Please don't tell Ryan I'm drinking.
I don't think so.  I feel.  I feel a bit funny.
You're never too old for a lolly.  I'm having one.
You must have been a baby.
Trust him.
Yes.
Let's just go home, okay?
Are you working on a new book?
Yes.
There's a goddamn sign on the gate.
How long ago was it?
No, never.
No, no thanks.
Thank you.
I just did a movie about Bob Yar, I played Gittle, the Jewish milkmaid who gets shot in the head, and they used Shostakovich's 13th Symphony.
Are you asking me to marry you?
You don't know she's a bitch.
It's not ruined, for fuck's sake.  It's one of your parties.
I didn't hear me say tonight.
Why don't you go fuck yourself?
No.  Not something new.
Well today it was Otis.  And you should keep him away from our yard.  Because Sheila will defend herself.
Oh.  Well, yes.  It's extraordinary.  You think you could sign it for us?
Evie has a little something for you.
I thought it was okay where it was.
Let's go in the kitchen and spy on everyone.
Honey, I'm not worried about you.  You are going to be a fantastic mom.  Not an issue.  I pressed you, remember?  Joe, on the other hand, is a different story.
But I am a possessive, fragile neurotic.
It's a shame he died prematurely...I was hoping to kill him myself.
Well, actually, uh -- I'm sort of making it up --
Divinely?
No...as a matter of fact...
Climb up that tree and get a better view!
Oh come on, <u>you're</u> the one who came after me -- the swarthy, earthy, sensual worker!
Yeah, well I have it on a reliable source...  that it exists.  Now you follow the yellow egg...  <u>That</u> direction.
<u>I</u> ruined <u>your</u> life?  Look, I was perfectly happy until I met you -- alright, I was miserable, but I was <u>happily miserable</u>.
Come on -- it's gone!  What are the chances of that happening again?
Want a list?
Yes?
Forget it.  You go ahead, I give up. I...I don't know what I was thinking. "Insectopia".
And do Princesses do improper things?
Then if I go to the worker bar, it isn't improper.  Anyway, don't worry. No one will recognize us in our disguises.
Mom!
I just joined up.  But I'm quitting! I got a trial membership!
Yeah.  Well -- no.  She's kind of playing hard to get.  As a matter of fact, she's playing completely unattainable.  So, what's on the schedule?  A brisk walk?  a foraging expedition?
Attack?  But -- I hate attacking! It's so hostile!
No -- I can see it in your eyes.  I'm a goner.  It's alright, Z.  In this ant's army, a soldier's life ain't worth a sack of fungus.  I can't feel my legs...
Don't make my mistake, kid... don't...be a grunt...your whole life...
Duty calls!
Scattered reports, sir.  Rumors. Nothing reliable.
Uh, actually, we <u>are</u> outnumbered sir...
Now I've heard a lot of scuttlebutt about a <u>food shortage</u>.  Well you boys are gonna be taken care of.  But in the meantime we're gonna eat the enemy for <u>breakfast</u>, we are gonna eat the enemy for <u>lunch</u>, and we are gonna eat the enemy for <u>dinner</u>!
Well it wasn't a masquerade, really, it was more what I'd call a clever ruse --
YES!!!  You know, people ask me, "Doctor, why are you always happy?" And I tell them it's mind over matter.  I don't <u>mind</u> that I don't <u>matter</u>!  Do you get it?  Do you get it?
Maybe I'll get lucky.  You know, Z, I wouldn't do this for anyone but you...
Oh, you don't have to worry about that -- nothing in there that anybody would want to steal...  Good night, Mrs. Dreyfuss.
From me the doctor has no secrets. Poor girl -- how could you do a thing like that?
Well, I have some paper towels --
Sheldrake?
Care to make a small wager?
Really?  I was looking at some figures from the Sickness and Accident Claims Division -- do you know that the average New Yorker between the ages of twenty and fifty has two and a half colds a year?
Good night.
I almost didn't recognize you -- this is the first time I've ever seen you in civilian clothes.
Would you like to?
Yeah.
Just tell 'em -- now and then.
I'm afraid not. I promised to have a drink with him -- he's been calling me all week --
What time does the show go on?
In the last six weeks you've only been in my elevator once -- and then you didn't take your hat off.
I don't blame you. It was unforgivable.
Much better.
I'd better get back to my elevator. I don't want to be fired.
Why?
Oh.  Yes?  Just a minute.  If you don't mind -- this is sort of personal
I just want to go brush my teeth --
My sister -- she'll want to know what happened to me.
I'll tell her I spent the night with a friend.
He's a liar. But that's not the worst part of it -- the worst part is -- I still love him.
Give what up?
A cemetery?
I'm going to write a letter to Mrs. Sheldrake.
You bet. I got a terrific hand.
Sure.  What's that funny smell?
I was washing my stockings, so I decided I might as well do your socks.
A what?
I wouldn't say that --  What would you like to have for diner? There's onion soup and canned asparagus --
I wonder how long it takes to get someone you're stuck on out of your system? If they'd only invent some kind of a pump for that --
Over a girl?
That's terrible.
Are you just making that up to make me feel better?
Cheers.
The dishes?
Oh.
Fine. How's your eye?
Nothing's changed. You know, we never finished that gin game --
Aren't you meeting Mr. Sheldrake?
That's very wise.
So who did you think it was -- Kris Kringle? What was going on here last night?
Mr. Dobisch said that?
Well, you know how it is -- things pile up.
I don't know.
What kind of joint are you running?
There's a certain key floating around the office -- from Kirkeby to Vanderhof to Eichelberger to Dobisch -- it's the key to a certain apartment -- and you know who that apartment belongs to?
Oh?  Oh!
Oh, no sir. Certainly not. Anyway, it's none of my business -- four apples, five apples -- what's the difference -- percentage-wise?
Sir?
Roger. And I'll get that other key.
That's impossible.  You'll have to handle this situation yourself -- as a matter of fact, I'm counting on you --
I know how worried you were about Miss Kubelik -- well, stop worrying -- I'm going to take her off your hands.
How's that again?
All we were going to do is eat and wash the dishes --
What does he mean, accident?
Oh, how are you, Baxter.  They keeping you busy these days?
Could be she's just a nice, respectable girl -- there are millions of them.
Oh, I'm very grateful.
No!
Well, that's very nice of you -- but who is this?
Well, after all, it's my apartment -- it's private property -- it's not a public playground.
Look, Mr. Vanderhof -- I've got you down here for tonight -- but I'm going to be using the place myself -- so I'll have to cancel.
Thank you, Mr. Vanderhof. But I'm sick -- I have this terrible cold -- and a fever -- and I got to go to bed right after work.
Hi, Doc.  Had a late call?
Yeah.  Well -- see you, Doc. 
Just as long as she's okay.
But you're not out of the woods yet, Baxter -- because most of them try it again!  You know where I am if you need me.
Happy New Year.
All I wanted him to do was let Mickey out for Christmas.
My husband. He's in Havana -- in jail.
No.
It's an emergency -- see you some other time.
No.
Come on, Fran.
I beg your pardon? MISS OLSEN I'm Miss Olsen -- Mr. Sheldrake's secretary.
Let me take that.
You know I liked it better long.
Six weeks. But who's counting?
Like old times. Same booth, same song --
Look, Jeff -- we had two wonderful months this summer -- and that was it. Happens all the time -- the wife and kids go away to the country, and the boss has a fling with the secretary or the manicurist -- or the elevator girl. Comes September, the picnic is over -- goodbye. The kids go back to school, the boss goes back to the wife, and the girl --  They don't make these shrimp like they used to.
Not here, Fran. Can't we go some place else?
Do I. That leaky little boat you rented -- and me in a black negligee and a life preserver --
I wasn't trying.
You know I do.
And just think -- right now there's some lucky girl in the building who's going to come after me --
Stop that, Fran.
You run along -- I want to fix my face.
He wouldn't.
I'd spell it out for you -- only I can't spell.
What guy?  Whose apartment is this, anyway?
What gives?
I'm sorry, Jeff. You know I could never hold my liquor --
See if they'll what?
One for all -- all for one --
We can use some fifty caliber and a 16 too --
I know, I know, it's all right. Come in this way. It's mined over there. This way. It's all right.
Moonby, 4th battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, Task Force. Ex-Corporal Moonby, deserted.
No.
No -- I worked too far north for LRRP.
Fat. That's real fat.
A long time.
That's right, sir -- I come from New Orleans -- I was raised to be a sauciere.. a great sauciere. We specialize in sauces; my whole family. It's what we do. I was supposed to go to Paris and study at the Escoffier School; I was saving the money. They called me for my physical so I figured the Navy had better food.
I know.
Kurtz. I'm supposed to kill him, just like he said.
Yeah, I know.
No -- most of 'em are still standing -- might've been disease.
Chief, try to keep out of where we're going -- Why we're goin' and what's gonna be the big surprise.
We're gonna have some help to get in the river. You know these waters, Chief ?
Where ?
I'll go with him --
All right I got a little surprise for you --
This whole area is lousy with V.C. -- We don't stand a chance. Lemme turn around and we'll be in Hau Fat in six minutes.
Looks pretty shallow.
One that went up for murder -- he was an Army Sergeant.
I wonder if that was the same copter.
Ours.
What is it?
What're you askin' me for -- put 'em in the first helicopter comes in tomorrow.
They must have seen the fire.
I've worked with them on occasions and I saw the movie , sir.
As I said, we can pay you in gold.
We took them from the dead.  Now -- I assume you want to rest, to shower. We'll attend to your repairs after dinner.
A man of war is never bothered to aid an ally -- you will follow me, Captain.
Of course. I -- Once we make our repairs, we could send word, we could have you evacuated from here.
Gunner's Mate, Third Class -- L. Johnson, sir.
That's right, sir.
Sure -- fine --
It's really long left slide, breaks on the short side of the point -- catches a south swell.
It's hairy ,though. That's where we lost McDonnel -- they shot the hell out of us. It's Charlie's point.
I got bored in Saigon.
Mercenaries -- agents, traitors -- they put out caches.
No. They put out two or three for every one I needed. When you get to the one you'll use, you just stake it out. If something feels wrong, you just pass it up. On one mission, I had to pass up three and ended up living on rats and chocolate bars.
So? I heard you had a good bunch of killers here.
You'll find enough Cong up there.
Music?
It'll get here, soldier.
Yeah, I like it...
No. My thinking is clear.  But my soul has gone mad.
I'm taking you back.
You get to know each other pretty well out there.
Yeah, Jesus Christ !
When?
Why?
What is this bridge?
I should be checking on the boat.
I just follow my footsteps, one at a time, trying to answer the little questions and staying away from the big ones.
Kurtz.  I know you've heard of him.
What did you hear?
What things?
I know.
I do.
No sir, I think -- this'll be a little bit different --
Straight up the road -- a concrete bunker -- Beverly Hills -- where else you think he'd be?
Needs patching.
So they can patch me up and put me in a cage?  Forget it. Meyerling's right -- I'm a dinosaur.  Greedy bastards like him, it's their turn with this land.  Put me in the woods, let me live or die on my own.
I'll get you there all right.
26   CONTINUED:  
Knew you had no native blood, even with your dark hair.  Blue eyes give you away.  My wife had blue eyes.
Had some good years.  Met her in '66.  She showed up one day in Coldfoot.  No one knew her.  One Sunday morning, she marched into a bar and announced she was available as a wife to the highest bidder.  Didn't work out in three months, she'd return the money and leave, no hard feelings.  My bid was eight thousand dollars.  Beautiful girl.
-- Corbett's a killer.
I thought I should check our emergency transmitters.
You can't stay here.  Go back to the Turtle.  I'll meet you back there in a few hours.
Here.  A transport plane is due at eleven.  Once I put him on it, it's all over.
I've got an idea.  We'll have to work fast.
Okay by me.  You're the one likes these hot springs so much.
Ecology.  Folks use that term for everything but what it means: who's eating who.
-- Killing is what you know.  Pack some food while I prep for the flight.  I'm sure not gonna let him go.
Hunting and trapping was a damn fine life.  Me and Mitchell, Bob and LeMalle, we were teams.  I'd always go with Mitchell.  Good man, Mitchell.  I'd let Bob worry about goddamn LeMalle.  We'd hire a plane in October.  On the way to a dirt airstrip somewhere, we'd drop supplies.  We'd land, tell the pilot to come back for us a few days before Christmas.
You sound like the tourists. Know-it-alls who read about survival in a magazine.  Fuck you.  You won't make it off this mountain.
Snow shelter.  Okay.  You dig. I'll have a little sit-down.
Told that's what our old man was. Planned on going to sea, me and Bob, 'til I read Jack London. Started trapping when I was ten. Mailed the furs to Sears.  Eight bucks for a skunk, three for a muskrat.  That was fine money.
Cowardly bastard.  I'm in handcuffs and I still scare the piss out of you.
You kill me, you sign your death warrant.  And hers.
But I would.
Nothing personal.
Just stay out of my face until I'm gone!
-- Sam Wilder was my cousin. He's why I came to Alaska.  All his letters, saying what a paradise it is.  But me ending up dead won't do Sam a lick of good.
Mobile Arctic Dwelling -- MAD.
Bet I could make some money turning Ben Corbett in.  Maybe more for lettin' him loose.  I was up in my cache.  Saw the Northland man come talk to you.
Aw, Jesus.  Told you this was trouble.  What about you, big shot?  Do something.  Who's side are you on, anyway?
Maybe they went back to Devil's Cauldron.
Huh?
I still don't feel safe leaving Spencer with someone. How do you spell it again?
I don't need one 'cause I know what's really going on here. I have to finish this letter or I'll go nuts.  This can't be right -- con- science.
Go ahead.
I want us to go out.
Everybody wants that, dear -- it doesn't exit...  Sorry... didn't mean to interrupt.
Uh-huh.
He's in the bathroom...  He's fine.
Emergency room only.
No. I asked. They said it's not covered under my plan. And it's not necessary anyway.
Once the tests come back, is there someone I can reach in your office for the results?
They're considerable. But Mr. Udall wants to be billed.
I see the help -- judgement call.
What's wrong with your son, anyway?
It's okay -- I'll sit here.
Are you totally gone? This is my private home...
What subject? That I wasn't there to take crap from you and bring you eggs? Do you have any control over how creepy you allow yourself to get?
How do you know about my mother?
No!!! Stay away from me!
Note. Put it in the note.
I'm not going to sleep with you. I will never, ever sleep with you. Never. Not ever.
Okay!!!! Anything else?!?
Hey, what I did for you is working out?
Just south to Baltimore, Maryland. So I know what you're going to ask next.  That you might ask -- I'm not certain.
You like sad stories -- you want mine.
That's not compliment, Melvin... That's just trying to sound smart so I feel stupid... A compliment is something nice about somebody else... Now or never.
I don't know why I brought you -- that idea occurred to me is all... It came out first... Hey, you kiss him -- me... He says he loves you. You two hit it off. But you don't want to... fine... Forget what I said about sex with Simon. It was a mistake.
It was a mistake.
Let me see... Ahh, gorgeous!
I don't know whether I'm being sensible or hard on you.
Oh, come on in and try not to ruin everything by being you.
I'm sorry... I can't hear you. I can't turn my head all the way yet... tell her we can't hear her.
I don't think so. You need help with the pants?
Can you believe in our little mix you're the good roommate.
Stop staring. Do a vase.
There's not going to be a debate. You must leave.
Two years ago...
Your neighbor -- Udall -- is taking care of him.
No, I promise...  not a chance. I own this guy. There was no one else. I'm on the move too much. Trust me.
So am I, Frank.
I'm not saying nothing to you.
You don't want to mess with me today. I'll figure something else out tomorrow.
Concerned. I'm just the hall monitor here.
No, it's all right. I'll just watch.
I got it. You're talking about your dog. I thought that was the name of the colored man I've been seeing in the hall.
Like thick molasses, with one of those wide noses perfect for smelling trouble and prison food...
Do you realize that I work at him?
Could you take it just a little easy, Mr. Udall?
That cleaning woman doesn't...
Get out.
Come on, sweetheart...
Thanks.
But sick -- nauseous -- where everything looks distorted and everything inside just aches -- when you can barely get up the will to complain.
I'm going back with you.
Another place where?
No... and you're supposed to be sensitive and sharp.
Well, if that's true then I'm really in trouble.
I forgot to lock the door.
I think of a man and take away reason and accountability.
How about that pose?  This is not fun...  Give me some direction.
The fact that you haven't said, "hold it" means I haven't done it right...  is that correct? I haven't done it right?
No.  No problem.  The airport, right?
So you're from around here?
But they caught the guy.  I heard it all.  Sounded like he just went berserk, fucking loco.  Shooting anybody.  Drugs, probably.
What?
What?  You think I'm running you up?
No fucking way.
What's your name?  We both know it's not Nicholai.
What?  What's okay?
I knew the same way in ten years you're going to know.
Why don't you tell me.
No.  No.  No.  I don't believe it.
I'm worried about you, Robert.
The contract was stolen.
He stole another contract.
Turn off the engine.
No, stay in the car.  I want you to understand something.  If I intended to kill you, you would already be dead.
No.  It's the truth.  I know what you are.  Like me, like Bain, you're a ghost, you're not part of the real world.  You don't have a social security number.  You don't pay taxes.  You've probably used ten different names over the last ten years.  A long time ago something probably happened, something illegal and you ran, you disappeared and it was easy.  You think you can do it again.  But I'm telling you, fading from the law is nothing.  No matter what you do, where you go, I swear to you that Bain will find you.
What do you want to know?
He was Russian.  Nicholai Tachlinkov.  A legend in the business when I was just starting. I admired him.  When I heard he loved chess I became obsessed with the game.
How did you get into the business?
The C.I.A.?
You were like a boy genius?
Why not?
You went from high school to the Agency?
Yes.
You said you didn't trust it.
Several.
Oh.  What do you think about?
Yes.
Here?
You should.  It's very important, that the body release the energy that builds in it.
That means you won't have a gun.
Except, if he doesn't come out of the hotel.
You can't know for sure, how can you?  I mean, you're not him.
It wasn't planned or premeditated. I swear.  Things happened beyond my control.  I understood; I saw where they were leading and I suppose that it just made sense.
Jesus, if someone had --
No.
Did he explain how this happened?
Are you attracted to me?
It can be.
Someone like me, like you.  A pro.
Shit.
Yes.
The point is, they are paying for information.  Real information.  Not tooth paste brands.  Not whether he wads of folds his toilet paper.  And no 16 hours of recorded phone sex. You are wasting everyone's time with this shit.
God damnit, Electra.  This is not a game.  This is business.
Yes.  Please come in.
How can a beautiful man like you be shy?
I called because I just want... I need to talk.
Sometimes.
All the time.
Just a little ways.  Up to those trees.
Why not?
Average.
I used to think he was right about a lot of things but now I don't know. I thought he was going somewhere but now I think I am wasting my time.
Son of the American ambassador and a banker - good enough?
Yeah, but it's not just that. To the Czech mind, any movement, whether political or literary should be underground. If it isn't, then it's not radical and not worthy of a look-in.
And not even then sometimes.
What's that? Free!
Give'em a break Doug, all it takes is a little work.
Right and not just the bar, Lubosh and his mates took the whole freakin' building.
It's big, right Jahn?
He was an electrician?
Don't worry, I'll give you a hand as soon as I can.
I'll try not to, I'll leave that to you. Anyway, there's still plenty more of it.
None, it's mine - you said it earlier, I'm nuts.
Sounds like a good reason to leave it alone.
Just aiding and abetting if it makes you feel better.
They'll never get us.
When your ready Son!
Both, see you later.
What?
I can't, I've got to split. I have to take a class at two o'clock.
I fell in love.
Hey Jahn.....You got a name for this thing?
I had a visit from the British Embassy. They think I'm a stray soccer hooligan.
No, but I ran into Jahn, seems him and his friends are in big trouble with the University, they might even be expelled.
Did you see a lawyer and go before a judge?
What happened?
WE gotta think of something.
So?
Did you see anything in the files?
Some deal you did there!
I'm not hungry, really.
We ain't going to give it away this time, are we?
Look, I don't care whether you go with Doug or not, but you_ve got to see him before he leaves.
Listen, Doug took the rap for us all so grab your coat 'cause you're going.
What?
What are you talking about?
No!
Do you know the way?
That one?
Doug?
That's my mum's.
No!
Sure, they wanted to know if I ever voted Conservative.
Doug, haven't seen you for a while.
I'll get the drinks, but not here. Let's split. I can't stand this any more, it's murdering my respect for literature.
How about you Brutus?
Alright, I'm coming. It's the perfect place Jahn, thanks.
Everybody is at home, it's no good.
No way Doug, I can't.
Then tell me, what will happen? Tell me!
So I hear, do you know some of the stage hands?
Don't worry. Thanks.
Yeah, great....Dobchay! It will dry, yes?
Ah, so what?
How?
Well she sure isn't normal.
Well, I've failed at everything else I've done and I can't hack it as a journalist, even for the Bugler.
I moving more to Communism now it's dying out.
No, I'm just running scared, same as everyone else.
Sometimes.
Yes, they had nothing to do with it.
A kind of freedom.
The choice is yours, it's not negotiable.
I have the Director's word, there will be no action against them. You may go once we have the disks.
Good, wait here, it will not take long and then you may go.
But I have to finish this....
No way, he even gave me back pay.
Just yesterday.
The files are in a sealed room and the University are under strict orders to stay away.
The building has been occupied and the locks have been changed.
Some Americans?
All the more reason to eliminate him.
It was all on a Russian format, I don't think that would be so easy; we must take that chance.
Heart be still.
I'm sorry about how we --
Kelly wouldn't do that.
Cuz nothing happened at school.
You're fine like that, Mom.
I meant he's a doctor.
I could do it if I tried. Even Kelly thinks so.
Landon. You have two parents. We're both here for you even --
Landon, honey. There's nothing more.
You do --
Demented.
Me.
No. Thanks. Gotta keep my wits for the drive home.
'Yes. You're-you're b-b- beautiful.'
Spend a year in the Peace Corps. Make a medical discovery --
In ten words or less?
Do you ever wonder why things happen the way they do?
That sounds like horseshit.
You don't know what you want --
It means you can do anything.
I heard what you did. Thank you.
Why not?
We're going somewhere. After. And no. I didn't ask your father.
What are you talking about?
Loved?
Because I had it named for you. I know it's not an official designation --
I'm sick.
I will.
I'm not going back to school.
Landon. I can't even do for myself.
Yes.
He wants help with his lines --
Jamie, he's careless. Reckless.  Is this really the best time to be making a new friend...?
I don't want you to see him outside school activities.
Up to?
I have expectations, too.
No. I want what's best for you.
Let's get something straight. You don't know me. I don't know you. But I know what you're about.  Keep your distance from this house -- and from Jamie.
That won't be possible.
No.
Okay. Sure.  My grandfather. When he was seven, he shook the hand of an old guy, a war vet or something, who had once shaken President Lincoln's hand.  Made a big impression on him.
How do you -- the two of you -- get by?
I'm not tired.
In there.
Yes. You?
I'd do that --
Where did you get -- ?
I didn't say you did.
Uh, yes, sir...
School? I never thought of school! If I went to school I could blend in with everybody else, couldn't I?
Listen,  Professor Brown told me you called last night and gave me your message...
Coming, Eileen...
Say what you were supposed to say in the cafeteria.
Nothing. Look, I'll write it down for you, okay?
Bic... It's a Bic pen.
I'm going to be at the dance.
George it's not your concern. Don't worry about it. Just remember that at 9:00, you'll be strolling through the parking lot and you'll see us -- struggling in the car, you'll run over, open the door and say....?
Oh. Uh... 'Hey, you! Get your damn hands off her!'  George paused. You really think I should swear?
No, George, just concentrate on the anger. Anger.
Not a holocaust --
All I can say is, that's one helluva attitude, Mr. McFly. 'Let's explode a hundred megaton Geothermal nuclear device, just to see it.'
No, no, not beyond an acceptable level. Have you been X-rayed recently, Martin?
Yeah,  Right.
Pro! Release the rope!
Oh, right, right... 
The future, Marty, the future is everything! I built this machine to see the future. So I am going to send Shemp twenty-four hours into the future. You can assist me, if you like.
You didn't, Professor. It was an accident! You see, what happened --
The power converter...
That's just great!
What if you lost your keys?
You're talking crazy! An atomic blast would melt me and the time machine in a matter of seconds!
Oh -- that -- I found it in the closet.
You did what?!?
But why? Why would she do that? She's supposed to marry the guy!
Are you trying to tell me that my mother's got the hots for me?
Nope. My father's never clenched a fist in his entire life!
What do you call this? 
Hell no! The way my mom carries on about sex -- you even mention the word and she goes into cardiac arrest. You shoulda seen her face when I told her we were gonna stay up all night Saturday, he added. Always afraid something is going to happen.
What do you mean?
Wouldn't be here if I hadn't.
I can't think of anything at the moment... I'd like you to write me out a slip, though, proving I came down here.
Mmmmm.
Tom...
For coming onto my property... With a gun.
What's your friend's name?
Well, I don't mind getting up early, so I got a job throwing garbage... I'm not in love with the stuff, okay.
Hey, wait a minute. When am I going to see you again?
Sure.
He'll say that?
Great.
I don't know.
Yeah, but I don't like it.
He didn't say anything to me about it.
Just looking.
Just to keep him out of the sun.
Positive?
Well, I feel kind of like an animal living out here. I mean, there's no place to bathe and... no place to get anything good to eat.
It was going too fast.
Yeah, then we'd be stuck here.
How about over here?
No.
Well, I'd like to leave a message, if that's okay.
Stay as long as you like.
Well, matter of fact, I don't have any.
Who're you?
You mean the guy from the old wine commercials?
Then that's it!
Which we all know are the forces that tend to pull objects part, right, professor?
Have you warned Professor Hikita?
And try the President's private number at the hospital.  Make sure this is on the level. We're busy people here.
Sure do pack a mean wallop...let's go...
Where's the professor?
They will never surrender.  They will fight to the end.
The door's locked.
Figures.  Anybody seen my scope?
Orson Wells?  What about Doctor Lizardo?
This is so embarrassing...
My name is Penny. Penny Priddy.  There I've said it, but it won't mean anything to you.  I'm a nobody.
I guess 'cause you remind me of someone I once knew, long ago before any of this craziness.
She was the Queen of the Netherlands.
What?  I don't understand you.  I don't understand anything anymore.
She was murdered by Hanoi Shan on our wedding night.
What?  If we just believe in Buckaroo Banzai?
Believe in Penny Priddy?
Penny--?!  Are you all right?
Possible atmospheric condition, sir...solar.  It's unusual, but no cause for alarm.  Intelligence reports the Soviets are having the same problem.
Nigh on ten years.  Been through a lotta scrapes together.
Perfect Tommy's just threatened by smart women.  Can you play that thing?
Why me?
She's just a damn road hugger, Allison.  Plus the man can drive.
Perhaps you and I could get together at some point also. –I'm sorry if that sounds abrupt. I just... I don't know anyone here in this town.
Please, Barton.
That son of a bitch... Don't get me wrong, he's a fine writer.
Hello.
Before Bill came to Hollywood.
What do you mean so to speak?! Audrey, how long have you been his... secretary?
That's hamburger grease, Bill.
That doesn't help anything, Bill.
Bill –
Drown all those rascals...
...Who is this?
Garland, it's me.
What DID you mean?
...Once or twice. His name is Charlie Meadows.
So. You talked to Mundt, what about?
What else?
I need help, Audrey.
Ever act?
What!?  Ted Okum doesn't know shit. They've assigned me enough pictures for a goddamn year. What Ted Okum doesn't know you could almost squeeze into the Hollywood Bowl.
Well, to tell you the truth, I'm having some trouble getting started–
Well not much.
Well, I've talked to Bill Mayhew-
He's a great writer –
I'm not sure anymore. I guess I try to make a difference.
To see pap.
Okay Barton, you're the artist, I'm just the ten percenter. You decide what you want and I'll make it happen. I'm only asking that your decision be informed by a little realism – if I can use that word and Hollywood in the same breath.
Yes... Isn't it?
That's okay, I assure you. It's just that I was trying to work –
Doesn't surprise me at all.
Thanks, I'll keep it in mind.
Hell, why not? Everyone wants quality. What kind of venue, that is to say, thematically, uh...
I can feel my butt getting sore already.
And I could tell you some stories –
Yeah, I guess that's tragedy right there.
Hell no! Jesus, I'm the kind of guy, I'll let you know if I'm bored. I find it all pretty damned interesting. I'm the kind schmoe who's generally interested in the other guy's point of view.
Sure, that's tough, but in a sense, we're all alone in this world aren't we Charlie?  I'm often surrounded by family and friends, but...
Not at all. It's damned interesting.
Okay, but hell, you should know what it is. I can show you in about thirty seconds.
That's all right, really –
Know about it? I can practically see how they're doin' it. Brother, I wish I had a piece of that.
Seems like I hear everything that goes on in this dump. Pipes or somethin'. I'm just glad I don't have to ply MY trade in the wee-wee hours.
Where there's life there's hope.
In a few days. Out to your stompin' grounds as a matter of fact – New York City. Things have gotten all balled up at the Head Office.
Well hell, buddy, don't pull a long face!  This is still home for me – I keep my room, and I'll be back sooner or later...
Don't pick up and leave without saying goodbye.
No... no...
Charlie, I'm in trouble. You've gotta help me.
Don't worry about it, Barton. We can sort it-
I don't know! I woke up, she was... God, you gotta believe me!
Have to, old timer. Just for a while.
Everything's okay, believe me. I know it's rough mentally, but everything's taken care of.
Charlie, I feel like I'm going crazy – like I'm losing my mind. I don't know what to do... I didn't do it, believe me. I'm sure of that, Charlie. I just...
Well, keep it for me. Maybe it'll bring you good luck. Yeah, it'll help you finish your script. You'll think about me...
Because you DON'T LISTEN!
I'm at the Earle.
CAN you?  You damn well better be. Jesus, if I hadn't been honest in my business dealings – well, of course, you can't always be honest, not with the sharks swimming around this town – but if you're a writer, you don't think about those things – if I'd been totally honest, I wouldn't be within a mile of this pool – unless I was cleaning it. But that's no reason for you not to be. Honest, I mean.  Not cleaning the pool.
Congratulations.
Yes sir, they –
With all due respect, sir, I think it's the best work I've done.
You didn't let ME down. Or even Lou. We don't live or die by what you scribble, Fink. You let Ben Geisler down. He liked you. Trusted you. And that's why he's gone. Fired.  That guy had a heart as big as the outdoors, and you fucked him. He tried to convince me to fire you too, but that would be too easy. No, you're under contract and you're gonna stay that way.  Anything you write will be the property of Capitol Pictures. And Capitol Pictures will not produce anything you write. Not until you grow up a little. You ain't no writer, Fink – you're a goddamn write-off.
I'm checking in. Barton Fink.
Must be.
Excuse me?
What –
The others are being sent.
Nine days – Tuesday –
That's right, Fink, he lives next door to you.
Funny. As in, he likes to ventilate people with a shotgun and then cut their heads off.
You want my partner to kiss your ass?
Couple of days ago we see the same M.O. out in Los Feliz.
...Fred...
No, not yet Jack. We just bought the story. Saturday Evening Post.
Ah, hell, let Bart take a crack at it.  He'll get into the swing of things or I don't know writers. Let's make it a dame, Bart, keep it simple. We don't gotta tackle the world our first time out. The important thing is we all have that Barton Fink feeling, but since you're Barton Fink I'm assuming you have it in spades.  Seriously Bart, I like you. We're off to a good start. Dammit, if all our writers were like you I wouldn't have to get so goddamn involved. I'd like to see something by the end of the week.
Did you find out about her parents?
Thanks.
It's not gonna take long, Sam.
Bring 1976 up.
Thank you.
Yeah.
She said what you said she'd say.
Yes you did.  I'm a big girl.  I can handle it.
My interest is in you, not in her. She seduces people, she manipulates --
Did you know Noah Goldstein?
I got a message on my machine to meet Gus here.  Where is he?
I wasn't dating him.  I was fucking him.
No.  We had a drink at the club. We left together.  I came here. He went home.
No.  I wasn't in the mood to have sex with anyone last night.
Are you arresting me?
I quit.
I've got a degree in psych.  It goes with the turf.  Games are fun.
No.
You still get the pleasure.  Didn't you ever fuck anybody else while you were married, Nick?
No, thanks.
I'd like to ask you some, too.
Yes, you did.  They never tested you, did they?  But Internal Affairs knew.
Fine.
What did Bobby Vasquez used to call you?
I told her it was the fuck of the century.
Do you want her to join us sometime?
Fine.  How's your back?
Do you want personal insights and adolescent secrets?  I don't do those.
I know.
No, she didn't... she never got jealous before... she got excited.  I don't have luck with women. There was this girl I met while I was in college.  I slept with her once.  She started following me around, taking my picture.  She dyed her hair, copied my clothes. Lisa something... Oberman.  It was awful.
Why?
You paid $50,000 for your character?
What about the other night. What about last night?  Was that to get to know your character?
I don't know.
He asked if I had an icepick in me yet.
Honey, why don't you go in the car?  I'll be right there.
I did, too.  She told me it was backwards -- she said you even styled your hair the way she did.
No.
How did it end?
What is this -- some kind of... Joke?  Are we playing games again?
We fuck like minks.  We raise rugrats.  We live happily ever after.
Rock and roll, Gus.  Johnny Boz.
I didn't know you knew who Picasso was, Gus.
Nothin'  I'll be okay, pop.
You don't like punk rockers?
You think I'd let you drive my Cadillac car?  I ain't lettin' no hear-up-his-ass person drive my Cadillac car.
She's right.  You got an icepick in you yet?
He was I.A.  He probably asked her about it.
I know what happened.  Catherine told me what happened.
I'm going with you.
Is he dead?
She said she didn't know herself, just sort of did it on impulse.  The razor just happened to be there.
What was it?
She didn't ask me for the ride. She asked anybody.
How you're saying she killed her parents?  Did she kill Bobby Vasquez, too?
She killed him.
Catherine Tramell.  It's part of her game.
Gus and I talked to her at Tramell's house.  All we did was write her name down.
Are you vice?
Can you check again?
He was shot.
No. Should I have?
I don't know.
My jacket? Gee, great...  Your show looks great. Quite a turnout. You look great. You kids. You drink red wine with fish. You can do anything! Make paintings in the basement of your gallery? First time I've heard of that!
Wow... Stop giving them away.  I got an invitation to model for Comme de Garcons... You wanna do it with me?
How about right now?
I know.
It's OK. Just have him bring you to dinner at Mr. Chow's later. We'll be there.
Bring him over sometime. I have some other stuff to show him.
Leeches. A long list of leeches.  It looks good like that.
Yes, but as a black painter –
What?
Not black.
We don't hang them at home, y'know – just in the streets..
Still not here.
Would you shut the fuck up? You hear what I'm doing?
I am... On Gina.  Fuck – I didn't think we were actually gonna do this.
About what?
He's the best painter in the world. I'm gonna give him one of these.
Come on in!
I guess you did.
It's Monday morning.
Basquiat, what did you take?
You mean babies with you?
A present I picked up for you.
You only want one Big Mac?
Me? Why?
You like your dad's paintings?
Thanks
Oh. I didn't know. I'll take you to the best restaurant in town.  You'll miss a great meal and I'll keep the scarf, anyway. What's your name?
No, I don't. I'm alone. We all are. Especially here. The world's unjust. The respect fools get. The disrespect I get.
Fame. My liquid hijack Marlboros and the moon and the cow that jumped over it.
Can you put me in the ring with him?
Fuck...  I forgot about that.
I'll make you another one.
I just don't think you're being fair.
I'm here for an interrogation. You've been called a graffiti artist and I wanna know why. All I see are scribble scrabble abstractions!
Which is why I hoped you'd snub him.
I will relay the message.
You'll never guess.
Well, I could ... free up some time...
Yes and no...
Somewhat like the lonesome secretary syndrome, I'd suppose.
If I said yes, then you might think me a Norman Bates, or a Ted Bundy type ... and then you might not let me kiss you.
Nor I, on the second.
But a kiss can be even deadlier, if you mean ... it.
I don't know.  Till we figure it out, let's ... let's keep dancing.
Damn those Carny bolsheviks the other night, throwing bricks at my windows --
Yes, did -- did you injure yourself on that ski slope?  Is that why you cut short your vacation and came back?
Sorry, Max.  A die for a die.
Well, a plan <u>is</u> forming ... A vicious one, involving the loss of innocent life ...
The name is Oswald Cobblepot.
She jumped.  She'd been depressed.
But who could've ... no, don't say it.
My god ... it's true.  The Penguin- Man of the sewers ... Please, don't h--
No, just give you a splitting headache.
What about the documents that prove you own half the firetraps in Gotham?
We need signatures.  To overturn the ballot.  I can supply those, Oswald.
That's fine, Oswald.  But to get the Mayor recalled, we still need a catalyst, a trigger, an incident. Like the Reichstag fire, the Gulf of Tonkin.
... Want 'em to go apeshit.  Nutso. Ballistic ... Do permanent damage to little old ladies.  Loot, pillage, annoy people in a big way ...  <u>Sounds</u> fun.  But I ...
Well I figured that your password was "Finster."  Your Pomeranian. And it was.  And it's all very interesting, though a bit on the technical side, I mean about how the power plant is a power plant in name only since in fact it's gonna be one big giant...
And who ... would you say this <u>to</u>?
I'm no cat.  I'm just an assistant. A <u>secretary</u> --
Too good?
I must protect my interests, Ms. Kyle.  And Interest Number One, is <u>moi</u>.
Ten years.  Barbara isn't really me niece, sir. She's Joanna Clark's daughter.
You came to tuck me in.  That's quite a switch.  I am looking for my brother, Wilfred. He is first butler to the Maharajah of Mirajanpore.  But Mirajanpore is a floating court, it travels across India, so Wilfred can be rather difficult to find.
Secrets are a virtual prerequisite in this house, don't you think?
There's a lovely inn just down --
Don't be silly, Alfred. After all, she's family.
Right here, sir.
What seems to be the problem?
Coming on line now, sir.
Hey, I'm the one who kicked Ivy's botanical butt.  Personally.  Me.  I did.
Whatever you say, lady.  It's all in a day's work for me.
I'm afraid to ask.
What exactly are you doing?
Damn?  Damn is not good.
Freeze, you're mad.  This capsule will slaughter thousands.
Mr. Freeze.
Surf's up.
What are you talking about?
She knows who we are.
Although the Wayne Foundation is hosting the event, sadly I will be unable to attend.  Thank you all.  Good day, Doctor.
Can I get some help over here?
What?  I'm sorry.  You were saying...
I know you're a dedicated bachelor. That you've had a your wild nights.
I'm betting on you.  You'll make someone a good husband one day. But I can't wait around forever. Don't answer now.  Just think it over.  Here's some food for thought.
Well...um...her.
Talk to him, Bruce.  There's nothing worse than losing someone without telling them how you feel.
She wants to kill you.
Listen, Captain Cold, the suit, maybe, even though silver went out in the 70's.  But those boots are unforgivable. What is it with men?
Let's cool it for now.  There's someone I want you to meet.
You leave Batman and Robin to me.
Adam and Evil.
At you?  Polly want a kiss?
Tell me and I'll kiss you.
Then you never loved me?
What exactly are you working on in there?  What are those screams?
Our work?
Well, I can respect your opinion.
Hello, Jason.  I think I've had a change of heart.
Is he all right?
He ran away?
Why, indeed?
As well as can be expected, I guess. Give me the bad news.
...Batman, Alfred. I'm Batman.
But 1, 3, 1, 8, & 5. What do they mean?
Of course. 13 is M....MRE.
Claw Island. Nygma's headquarters. I'm sure that's where they're keeping Chase.  Are all the Batsuits destroyed?
How come this is the only locked door around this museum? What's back there?
I didn't know that. See? You _are_ interesting. And call me Chase. By the way, do you have a first name? Or do I just call you bats?
Try a fireman. Less to take off.
We could give it a try. I'll bring the wine, you bring the scarred psyche.
Precisely. What's on all our minds? Brainwaves. The future of Wayne Enterprises is Brainwaves!
No. Don't leave me! My invention! I need you!
Wacko? That a technical term?
Well, I met someone...
You could say he kind of dropped out of the sky and bang-. I think he felt it too.
I'd say this goes a little beyond taking your work home.
Rage. Anger. Passion. Pain.
What?
You don't understand. It's an addiction. You fight night after night, trying to fill the emptiness. But the pain's back in the morning. And somewhere along the way it stops being a choice.  I want better for you.
You have a real gratitude problem. You know that, Bruce? I need a name. Batboy? The Dark Earl? What's a good side kick name?
...I missed Two-Face by a heartbeat. When we catch him, you gotta let me kill him!
I saved your life. You owe me. So either you let me be your partner or I'm going after Harvey on my own.
Who is it?
What the hell is going on here?
...You gonna kill me?
You _are_ Two-Face, you would need to face both rivers, both uptown and downtown simultaneously. Only one spot in Gotham serves these bi- zonal, bi-coastal needs...
Kill me? Well, alright. Go ahead. Take the empire. All yours.  Hell, Harv, old pals. I'll kill me for you.
I'd say about thirty feet, sir.
Thank you, Alfred.  I hope you'll excuse me.  It was a great pleasure meeting you.  And you.
... Very good, sir.
... Murderer...
He won't kill her. -- GODDAMMIT!
Too many people. Come on!  SHIELDS!!
Well -- I think you might consider
I just wanted to distract them. I wasn't trying to get a picture of you.
Exploring. In the woods. Many years ago. -- I was a solitary child.
Too much work.  I'm not really the physical type -- Thank you, Alfred.
Well, Bruce, some types are a little more obvious than others.
I'll take you home if you'd like.
Then there's one thing in the world you don't do very well. And I know what it is -- Now you'll have to kill me.
I said I'd call you the minute I got free.  And I did -- And here we are.
... Looks like a convention.
I wish you'd...
... I know it's you, Bruce. I'm not going to talk to you unless we can discuss it...
No one would miss me.
You're one man. You can't save everybody.
... Where are you calling from?
Finding out where she is.
I've had an automatic tracer on this number ever since he tracked you to the museum.
Vicki. Do you love half of me? Or all of me?
I suggest a nice big bomb.
WHAT?
It's a detour. They're backed up for blocks!
Because I want someone I can trust.
Jack?  Thank God.  I can't believe it's you.  I heard you'd been --
I've died once already.  It wasn't so bad -- In fact I recommend it.
HA!  That's the best part. I CAN'T!!
What?  I improved her a little...
Miss Vale, was it something I said?  Do you want to sniff my flower?
Likes to kill? KNOX  Women find him magnetic.
Bruce Wayne?  Date?  He called you up and asked you for a date?  Shit.  HEY, MIRANDA!  C'MERE!  Now pay close attention to this.  Miranda -- tell my friend here what you told me about Bruce Wayne.
... Oh?  Why is that, Vicki?
Right.  And they know him.  And that's why it would never occur to them for a minute that their old buddy Bruce puts on a cape at night and goes out looking for --
Yeah. Deja vu.
You okay?
And they asked me if we'd like to ... you know... put him up for a while.
Yes, there are hotels.  They just thought maybe it'd be nice for him to stay with a real American family.  Popcorn, waffles, all that stuff.
Ahm - he's male.  He's English.  He's a doctor of er ... at least 2 things.  I think they would have mentioned if he was a blind dwarf.  Or one of those guys who kills lots of people all the time.  I think we're looking at someone moderately normal here.
Your face smells like a foot.
It's okay.  There's no one out here. Just open the door.  Trust me.
About Charles...
I'm afraid you don't know the half of it. Sit down.  I have a tale to tell.  And not a happy one.
Night.
Uh ... yes ...
Great.  Classic timing.  Why don't you ask her just to leave a date for the divorce?  I'll check my diary later.
Whistler was a great painter, but he wasn't a great chooser of paints ....
Yes.  I'11 mention it to him.  But ... he's kind of his own guy, you know?
Yes.  Ahm.  I was just wondering where my English house guest had got to.
Well, bravo!  What with you and Whistler's Ma - I think I've got a winning team.
Very pleased you've taken him in, David.  At a time when no-one's job is safe, it really identifies you as a team player.
Yes, sir.  Yes, sir.  Congratulations. Marvellous thing.  Bravo.
Quite right, sir.
Okay, so the guy's gonna look like Meatloaf's backside.  No-one's asking you to go to bed with him.
Ah ... Jennifer, I need you to watch Kevin.  Jen?
Great, good.
Jennifer!  This is not - repeat, not! how we do things in this family. I've told you never to get on one of those death traps!  Please - talk to me.  I promise to be reasonable.
Yes?
NO, seriously - I know he's your boyfriend, but there's something about his upper lip that is so weird.  What do you think it is, Dad?  Jen says it's a moustache, I say it's a cluster of about 11 mosquitoes, resting.
Yeah, heh heh.
Yeah, heh heh. Let's just wheel this thing back to the house.
Entert-ain...us...an-us...Oh yeah! Heh heh. Anus. Heh heh.
What's your problem Beavis?
Huh huh. Soon, she will be mine.
Yeah, heh heh. I thought there'd be casinos and lights and stuff.
Yeah, we should party.
Huh huh. Get out of the way, Beavis, I wanna sit by the window. Huh huh.
Huh huh. You mean like this?
Heh hmm heh heh.
Cool, huh huh.
Uh... I think I'm seeing something too. It's like a really long time ago...
Huh huh. Jack. Huh huh.
Uh, oh yeah. Cool. They can take us to Washington and we can finally score.
Could you, like, tell her we're ready to score?
What's your problem Beavis?
Yeah, he had a lot of problems. Huh huh huh.
Butt-dumpling...
Uh... butt-snatch...
Whoa! heh heh. Hey Butt-Head, this chick is pretty cool. She says there's gonna be tons of sluts in Las Vegas! Heh heh heh.
Heh heh, thanks.
Sorry to hear that. Me, I took a beating.
Do you have T.P.? T.P. for my bunghole?
He's jerkin' us off. I think we're gonna have to take him out. Get ready to fire on my orders...  This is your last chance. Give us the unit now...
Well, sir it's not good.  Roll the tape... The X-5 unit is a new top-secret biological weapon, a manmade virus...
Agent Hurley...
Attention all units. We've got him. He's in front of a camper in the visitor's lot.
Uh, Butt-Head.
Whoa, huh huh. Cool.
Uh, yeah. Does she have big hooters?
So do I, Jane.  I'm on vacation.
I will <u>never</u> sell this house. I'll be buried in my yard next to Barbara.  Holding hands!  And a good paintbrush!
Helen got it for me in Oslo.
Oh, honey, I'm so glad we're spending our vacation at home.
Ah, the ever-tactful Jane.  Let's just relax about having children.
That's how long you were gone.
De<u>ceased</u>.  I don't know where it came from.
This book isn't arranged that way. What do you want to know?
I don't see anything about 'Rewards and Punishments' or 'Heaven and Hell.'  This book reads like stereo instructions!  Listen to this... 'Geographical and Temporal Perimeters... Functional perimeters vary from manifestation to manifestation.'  This is going to take some time.
Arrogant.  That's Jane Butterfield all right...
That's my girl!
I don't know if there's anything we can do.
<u>You</u> left me.
Look at this, everything is different down here.  All our furniture is gone.
Look, she's right.  We'll just start simple, honey, be tougher. I feel... confident.  C'mon.
She's got <u>photos</u>, Barbara.
Three times.  Powerful number.
Maybe we should knock first?
I don't care, I've changed my mind.  ... I feel <u>really</u> confident.  We're getting better at this stuff.  We can scare them off ourselves -- tonight!  I've got an idea.  You're going to love it... I'm going to hate it.
The sushi?  I did the wine. Didn't you do the sushi?
I didn't --
All right.
We're ghosts.
<u>Night of the Living Dead</u>?  It's this gross movie.
Is this like a trick question?
I certainly did.  I'd finish it too, but... I don't get out much.
Wait a minute.  I had some licorice ice cream earlier.  You guys could be gas.  What if... I'm dreaming. Can you do any neat tricks to prove you're not gas?
I got an A!
D-90's.  You spend a hundred and twenty-five years on earth, actually, in that house, during which you get only three class- one D-90 intercessions with Juno. You probably haven't even read through the manual completely yet.
But... the Deetzes are <u>destroying</u> our house.
Hi ho, hi ho, it's off to work I go!
You wish!  I nearly scored with that little blonde.  I need me a short little queen.
We have to start simpler, is that it?
And if we need <u>you</u> again, how do we...?
Bio-<u>busting</u>.  I <u>loves</u> bio-busting. Who do I gotta kill?  Family -- right?  Obnoxious I bet.  Mommie, daddy, piglets.
What do you mean?  What's he do?
Our cemetery?
Forget him.  He'll remain with his whores until someone calls him.  You need to worry about people like <u>Otho</u>.  There are a lot of phony trance mediums.  They usually can't make the formulas work, but if Otho stumbles on the right words in that handbook... he could hurt you.  As in -- <u>exorcism</u>.
You're not gross.  Why were you wearing a sheet?
Wait... I don't think it would be a very good idea if you told your parents that we're up here.
That's right, Jane.  Complete vacation.
Of course they're dead.  They're ghosts.
I think so.
I... I don't know what your name is.
Good thing you are beautiful, kid. You are <u>dumb</u>!
You've <u>got</u> to say it!
How'd you like to be married to... the King...?
You've got to help them.
It's too late, Charles.  I'm sorry.
Let me have it.
Come on.  Leave their stuff alone.
I cannot believe this.
I can't <u>bring</u> the ghosts.  They're not here!
Nonsense, everytime she says that, the paint peels, and some wild creature tries to kill us.
Otho, can you do it?
Any particular kind?
I saw some ghosts.
I'm sorry already.
You read my <u>mind</u>!  I love clients who can read my mind.  I don't think people realize how strong a connection there is between interior decoration and the supernatural.
Gooood!
She's been without therapy up here and I will not allow her to ruin...
Look at the tiny figures.
That's slavery and murder.  You don't know these people.  They're just like you and me.  They're nice people!
Yes, Robert. I will.
Yes, Robert. I know about the President.
I see...  ... And you are really a gardener, aren't you?
We have common foes, Chauncey - kid lawyers and our physician!
In a minute, Robert - in a minute... Chauncey, I would like to ask a favor of you...
... But he's...?
Chauncey is so sensitive... He was overcome with grief...
Yes, sir.
Oh, yes.
Yes. I would like to be on that show.
No. I like this attic very much.
There's no need for a hospital.
I agree.
Yes. Thank you.
Oh? Certainly...
No, Eve. I'm not related to Basil and Perdita.
Thank you, Eve - I like this house very much.
Hello, Eve.
No, thank you.
I like the President. He is a very nice man.
Yes, Eve. I'm very glad that you didn't open.
He was very ill, I stayed with him for a while.
Yes. I've been looking for you, too, Eve.
Yes, that is correct. I think you should ask Mr. Rand that.
I have nothing more to say.
I don't want Robert.
Yes, I understand.
I certainly do.
... I see.
Yes. You look very sick.
Yes. I am very hungry.
Yes. Chauncey is fine.
Thank you, Ben.  ... The nurse did a very good job, Ben.
I understand.
Yes.
I can't write.
I can't read.
Yes, I would like to see Ben.
Yes.
Yes sir, I guess that's true smallest room in the house.
Is his back feeling better?
Must of happened durin' the night, I don't know... Lord, he wasn't breathin' and as cold as a fish. I touched him, just to see, and you believe me, Chance - that's doin' more than I get paid to do... Then I just covered him up, pulled the sheet over his head...
You're welcome.
Yes. That is surprising.
I hope so.
No. I don't object.
Thank you.
I am a very serious gardener.
No.
Joe Saracini. He was a mason that did some repairs on the brickwork at the rear of the house. That was in 1952.
Yes. I remember when he came. He was very fat and had short hair and showed me some pictures from a funny little book.
Very well, Mr. Chance - if you insist on dragging this matter on... But I must inform you this house will be closed tomorrow at noon. If indeed, you do reside here, you will have to move out.
... Oh, really...
That is correct. In a garden, growth has its season. There is spring and summer, but there is also fall and winter. And then spring and summer again...
No, it's been a good day - better than yours, from what I've been told.
Hah!... Tell me the truth, Eve - if I wait until I feel better, will I ever meet the man?
Yeah... He and my father used to ride together back in the thirties... Fox hunting... Before I was born...
Gladly...  ... The safe is in Mr. Jennings' bedroom, that'll be stop number one.
I really don't know, Tom - he seems so honest and simple... In a way, he's quite charming...
Yes, Chauncey Gardiner.
Gardiner, yes, sir.
Yes, Mr. President, we attempted to contact Mr. Rand, but he was too ill to...
Big business. I could work with that faction quite nicely, Colonel Novogrod.
Mr. Gardiner, my pleasure.
I sympathize with your position, Mr. President, I know how difficult it is to be straightforward, the reaction to such a speech could be chaos.
It's that serious, huh?
I'm sorry, too. Well, Nancy wanted me to send along her best to the two of you - and, Ben, I want to thank you for your time and thoughts.
Yeah.
I'm pretty sure it was you. Hey, could I get your autograph now? It's for .... oh, what the hell, it's for me! I'm your biggest fan!
Well, you know, maybe something else until this whole puppet thing turns around.
The monkey.
Adorable. What time are they supposed to be here?
The ferret?
Okay. Maybe tomorrow.
You weren't you. You were John Malkovich.
Everything felt right for the first time. I need to go back to make sure, then if the feeling is still there. I'm going to speak to Dr. Feldman about sexual reassignment surgery.
Don't crowd me, Craig.
I'm moving. Remember? What's with the hooded cloak?
What?
No they're not.
What's that?
We love her, Craig. I'm sorry.
Yeah, well welcome to the nineties.
What the hell, darling. Close early today, live dangerously.
What's that?
Things change. Anyway, you gave up your claim to that love the first time you stuck your dick in Maxine.
I love you so much.
He's a lucky man.  Do I know him?
Oh, right. As long as you're happy. I'm sure he's a better lover than I ever was.
Holy shit, yes!
Simulates?
Schwartz.
My name is Schwartz.
I am a trained performer.
I'm afraid I... have no idea what you are saying... you bastard!
Flattery will get you everywhere, my boy. But I'm afraid I have to trust Floris on this one. You see, she has her doctorate in speech impedimentology from Case Western. Perhaps you've read her memoirs, "I can't understand a word any of you are saying."
Pity, it tells it like it is. That's why the eastern, read Jewish, publishing establishment won't touch it. That's a quote from the book jacket. George Will, I think.  I apologize if you can't understan a word I'm saying, Dr. Schwartz.
Low overhead, m'boy. We pass the savings on to you.  But seriously, that's all covered in orientation.
Dr. Lester, it's been really fascinating, but I'm afraid I have to get home to my wife now.
Dr. Lester, I don't know what you're talking about.
No, really.
I just wanted to say “hi.”  Did you know I still don't know your name or where you work?
You're a fag or a liar.
Of course, right this way, Mr. Malkovich. Compliments of the house.
Ha ha ha!
Hush, sweetheart.
Can I be anyone I want?
Yes. Yes. A thousand times, yes!
And as I said, sir, we can't very well exert physical persuasion upon the sacred vessel Malkovich.
Didn't mean to imply that you were, sir.
The kid's got talent. You've never seen Malkovich like this. Schwartz had him up there singing and dancing. Impressions.
I like that.
Well, if Mantini wins, Schwartz will leave Malkovich, right? So, if he needs it, I help Mantini's performance a bit, give him an edge. Spice up the show.
Gehginnis ondah foam?
Fork ah did?
Do you?
Yeah yeah yeah. Yadda yadda yadda. Were you stoned?
All the better. Hey, Hot Lesbian Witches, next Geraldo, buddy boy. Ha ha ha.
Yes, of course, Dr. Lester.
Let her go, Craig. I mean “him."
After that I'll introduce you to my favorite monkey, Elijah. He's got an ulcer, due to a suppressed childhood trauma. But we're getting to the bottom of it.  Psychotherapy.
Give me one hour to get inside him Exactly.
I love you, Lotte.
We'll see, Schwartz. We'll see.
It's just that I fantasize about you and, well, speaking to you now has gotten me sort of excited and...
Oh, I'm really glad you called.
Oh sure. It's very rewarding...
Do you mind?
Oh, Lotte...
What the fuck is going on?
You see, Maxine, it isn't just playing with dolls.
Wait a minute! What if everybody knew? What if we presented Malkovich as the world's most complicated puppet and me as the only puppeteer sophisticated enough to work him? We'd wipe the floor with the Great Mantini!
He's a selfish bastard.
Perhaps you'll want to consult that Ouija board again.
Yonder. Twin chestnuts in the yard.
No. I'm looking for what I was put here to look for: the back door.
WHERE ARE THE MEN WITHOUT SKIN?
YES.
YOUR FACE IS MINE.
Don't talk like that. Your mama loves you.
More than all right. Miss Bodwin, she teach me stuff..Book stuff. She says I might go to Oberlin. She's experimenting on me.
I don't know. I think I've lost my mother, Paul D.
I don't. I have my own.
Extra?
OOh, yeah...Don't know if it's the floor or the skating.
That was fun.
Go upstairs I said!!
NO!...She wanted me to do it.
Ain't no new Negroes in this town I don't know about. What she look like? You sure that wasn't Denver?
You sure?
Might see anything at all at 124.
Yeah. Asked Rev. Pike if he could stay in the cellar.
Unrile yourself, Stamp. It's only a few days he been there.
He ask, I give him anything.
Her who?
I run him off.
He didn't know nothing. And nobody. Except her, from when they was at that place Baby Suggs was at.
No use thinking these things now.
I don't believe that. I won't.
Who is she? Where she come from?
Paul D.
You got to get up from here, girl.
Don't talk to me, Mr. Sawyer. Don't say nothing to me this morning.
You're not dealing with morons here.
Yeah sure, if I'm ever in the neighborhood, need to use the john.
Oh, nothin', you know.
Shit.
Come and get it.  Fucking nihilist.
Walter, how--
I'm going home, Donny.
Huh?
WELL THEY CAN FUCKING UN-POST IT!
Oh for Christ--will you shut the fuck up, Donny.
Well--
We'll be near the In-and-Out Burger.
That's it!  Outta this fucking cab!
I'm not really, uh.
Uh-huh.
Lebowski on the right?
--and bowling.  I'll tell you the truth, Brandt, I don't remember most of it.--Jeez!  Fuck me!
And the, uh, the briefcase?
Sure.  Take it easy, Dude--I know that you will.
Does the Pope shit in the woods?
I FUCKEEN KILL JOR FUCKEEN CAR!
Jeffrey Lebowski.
Sex.  The physical act of love. Coitus.  Do you like it?
I'm getting to your rug. My  father and I don't get along; he doesn't approve of my lifestyle and, needless to say, I don't approve of his. Still, I hardly wish to make my father's embezzlement a police matter, so I'm proposing that you try to recover the money from the people you delivered it to.
If you successfully do so, I will compensate you to the tune of 1% of the recovered sum.
Please see him, Jeffrey.  He's a good man, and thorough.
I, uh... money, yeah, I gotta respecfully, 69 you know, tender my resignation on that matter, 'cause it looks like your mother really was kidnapped after all.
The main guy, Dieter--
Beaver?  You mean vagina?--I mean, you know him?
Mmnun.
Huh?  He's fucking loaded.
Yeah man, it really tied the room together--
This Chinaman who peed on my rug, I can't go give him a bill so what the fuck are you talking about?
Walter, this is not a guy who built the rail- roads, here, this is a guy who peed on my--
Jeff Lebowski.  Come on.  This other Jeffrey Lebowski.  The millionaire. He's gonna be easier to find anyway than these two, uh. these two  . . . And he has the wealth, uh, the resources obviously, and there is no reason, no FUCKING reason, why his wife should go out and owe money and they pee on your rug.  Am I wrong?
Okay. That, uh.
What the fuck're you talking about? The carrier.  What's in the fucking carrier?
You brought a fucking Pomeranian bowling?
MARK IT ZERO!
You know Dude, I myself dabbled with pacifism at one point.  Not in Nam, of course--
You mean--beyond pacifism?
It's all a goddamn fake.  Like Lenin said, look for the person who will benefit.  And you will, uh, you know, you'll, uh, you know what I'm trying to say--
I don't see any connection to Vietnam, Walter.
My dirty undies.  Laundry, Dude. The whites.
Thaaaat's right, Dude.  The weight. The ringer can't look empty.
My point, Dude, is why should we settle for twenty grand when we can keep the entire million.  Am I wrong?
What the fuck is going on there?
I'm throwing the money, Walter! We're not fucking around!
Your wheel, Dude!  I'm rolling out!
Well, certainly that's a possibility, Dude--
Whose toe was it, Walter?
The nail polish, Walter.
Someone else's--where the fuck are they gonna--
They're gonna kill her, Walter, and then they're gonna kill me--
What about the toe?
--We're sympathizing here, Dude--
Who the f--have you ever heard of a little show called Branded, Dude?
All but one man died?  There at Bitter Creek?
Is the car out front yours?
Oh, for Christ's sake, Walter!
And the fucking money!
What's your point, Dude?
What the fuck are you talking about? I converted when I married Cynthia! Come on, Dude!
Yeah?  What do you think happens when you get divorced?  You turn in your library card?  Get a new driver's license?  Stop being Jewish?
I'm as Jewish as fucking Tevye
AND I'D LIKE MY UNDIES BACK!
No Dude.
A hundred and eighty dollars?!
Walter--
Dude, I'm sorry--
...Us? DUDE
Right, Dude.
You told Brandt on the phone, he told me.  So where do I fit in?
My wife is not the issue here. I hope that my wife will someday learn to live on her allowance, which is ample, but if she doesn't, sir, that will be her problem, not mine, just as your rug is your problem, just as every bum's lot in life is his own responsibility regardless of whom he chooses to blame.  I didn't blame anyone for the loss of my legs, some chinaman in Korea took them from me but I went out and achieved anyway. I can't solve your problems, sir, only you can.
Dude.
Sure.  That and a pair of testicles.
Strong men also cry. . . Strong men also cry.
No.  No Mr. Lebowski, that had not occurred to me.
Walter!
You're bullies!  Cowards, both of you!
This is not Nam.  This is bowling. There are rules.
Am I wrong!?
Impressive.
They tell bedtime stories about you. Blade the big, bad boogie-man.  Frankly, I'm disappointed.  That you were willing to come along so easily, I mean.  Without any assurances.
I haven't forgotten.
Fry 'em.
Pain cuts the deepest, isn't that what you said?
Not good.
Like a fucking heifer took a dump in my mouth.
Sounds like a plan.
Where the hell have you been?
Why don't you ask your girlfriend?
Blood...
He wants us to know he's hunting us now.
You're wasting your time, Blade.  The flechette's a dud.
Getting your attention, Paco.
You experimented on your own, son?
Not that I'm in contact with.
Us?  What are you talking about?
Look, kid, they obviously found your base of operations.  If it was a trap, why flip their dicks by announcing themselves?
Listen. You have to -- finish me off. You don't want me coming back.
Take him.
It's because I'm human that I can do this.
You're blind --
Who is LaMagra?
"The Blood Tide".
Not anymore. You've seen one of them. You won't be allowed to live after that.
Figured they'd send someone after you. Thought I'd wait around and see who showed up.
It worked, didn't it?
Why in God's name would anyone want to work for them?
It's war, now get the fuck out of the way!
He will.
There are worse things than vampires out there.
Nothing that won't heal by dawn.
Serum -- it's a human hemoglobin substitute.
Those aren't real memories. No one has that kind of recall.
I'm not leaving without you.
These are my people now. I'm one of them.
I don't believe that.
What about the chemistry panel?
Just the blood sample from the pericardial sac.
Sometimes --
Jesus, Karen, you're breaking my heart here --
Please. You and the other Elders wouldn't know what to do with these texts if your lives depended on it.  Which, of course, they do.
The Blood Tide. Our long-prophesied holy war against the humans. There's a force, you see -- a spirit that exists in our blood. I've discovered a way to invoke it.
That's right. The answers were there all along, of course, scribbled down in the forgotten languages of my kind. Waiting for someone with the patience to decipher them. My elders were foolish enough to dismiss them as wives tales. But I knew better.  Imagine my surprise when Blade turned out to be the key which would set that force free.
What makes you think we want to be cured? Blood is only part of the equation. The hunt, the killing, that's what the Thirst is really about.
So that's it? You guys just patch me up and send me on my way?
You've been listening in the whole time?
What happens if he doesn't take the serum?
Habit, mostly, just like this.
A coward too. That's why she had to go.
Closer.
Bullshit! Talk!
Yes.
Look, this is not my field of expertise. You seem stabilized, but why take any chances? Let's keep you overnight and have the Staff obstetrician do a follow-up tomorrow.
--Christ almighty--
--it's called "morning sickness," asshole--
I dunno, probably right up there, based on her resume.
Buried deep under 200 years worth of soil, ash, and compost layers.
That's a joke?
Domini. Domini Von Teer.
She <u>is</u>--she's helped solve a bunch of murders: Arizona, New Mexico--
--<u>whoever</u>--they built an entire house <u>around</u> a <u>tree</u>. Sticking up right through the living room. Somebody like to explain that to me?
Oh, <u>c'mon</u>--even you have to admit this is weird.
Like how weirded-out you are with this pregnancy thing.
No idea. But if that's all we've got left--
--bullshit!
--you should get back into bed.
Little boys. Looking up my skirt as I danced. Giggling.
--no, you're not. You love me too much. You don't want to see them kill me.
--Christ, they find out I let you have it for the weekend--
You have to go.
I want amphetamines.
--hunch. Just sort've saw 'em there.
No.
What? That made her lose the baby?
Turn the tapes back on.
It's not about witches, goddamnit!
Oh, for chrissake, she was an actor.
Hadn't even opened the thing since Cub scouts.
Ask me what I don't have.
Yeah?
--Cotter: shut up.
How's she going to know where to--
--I don't trust anybody, not even me, anymore--
Fine.
--now there.
Look, guys, we're cold, we're tired we're <u>shook</u>--we just want to get out of here as soon as there's light. We saw something up at Coffin Rock today--
A Cyber Entrepreneurialship.
--great: we can watch Domini sleep for hours--or, shit, maybe if we stay at it for a couple of days, maybe a deer'll dash by!
--still go see the OB in the morning--
Ancient runes--
Ah, Domini?
Smells Like Teenage Spirit.
No. I don't think so.
Then I have no idea.
There is something <u>there</u>--don't ask, just trust me.
Still working on it.
It touched me, don't you see it now?
Get some more beer.
They never burned witches in this country, they hanged them.
Hey, chemicals, fear, sleep- deprivation--and a round-the-clock obsession with the occult--hell've a recipe for a mind-fuck.
I thought all witches were benign and good.
Yes! I need to speak to Sheriff Von Teer.
Yes.
No.
You can sleep on the bed if you want.
I said, Marty, how come you're anal and I gotta go to the psychiatrist?
I don't know. I better get off now.
I cleaned it all up, but that ain't important...
What do you want to know?
Going out with Meurice.
I'm not surprised, the company you've been keeping the last ten years.
See, Wednesday's the special on RC Cola. I don't know if I explained about the TV option. If there's a TV in the room, you got to pay the option.
...Friday?
Lubbock?
See, I never knew that.
No.
Back where?
Yeah, don't come by here any more. If I need you again I know which rock to turn over.
It's not strictly legal.
Right.
No. I think I'll stay right here in hell.
We get a lot of assholes in here, Marty.
Not here tonight. Wasn't here last night. He's especially not back in his office.
You we telling me about the Ring of Fire.
I've seen a few.
Okay honey.
Sometimes it helps to talk things over. for instance, many marriages are saved by.
Hey, I brought some friends. and some beer.
Darling, where are the glasses?. Oh. here they are.
Shit. let's drink to something else. let's drink to fuckin'. Say here's to your fuck Frank.
Right Ben. LET'S GO FUCK. I'll fuck anything that moves.
Yes.
Sure I do. I understand he's in the hospital. How is he?
It must be great.
Blue. It's Blue Velvet.
Yeah.
No. not at all.
Only you. and the photo lab.
Yes sir.
Does Dorothy know her husband is dead?
. my bourbon.
He's a friend. from the neighborhood. we were just talking.
Then, shut up!
Alright, suit yourself.
No way. get out. I'm gonna tell Frank. I'm gonna tell him what you said.
I wanted to see you.
No.
See my nipples?
You can kiss them if you want. Fell them . They're getting hard.
Yes, I like you.
What?
I looked for you in my closet tonight.  It's crazy, I don't know where you came from but. I like you.
No.
Why are you so interested? Why do you keep asking me?
. or do you just want me? I'm going to let you enter me now.
Please. please stay.
Sure I do.
I'm doing it.
Whatiya mean?
Yes.
Beeeee careful.
Just get outta my bed.
Men are crazy. then they put their craziness into me. then it makes me crazy. then they aren't so crazy for awhile. then they put their craziness in me again.  . it's burning me. but I love you. I do, I do. Did you know that? Did you know that I love you?
I did. are you?
I'm getting a little bit fat. I hate that.
No.  Hi baby.
Oh God, Jeffrey. is that you? Oh God.
I promise, Dorothy. I promise.
Yeah. I guess I did.  What's going to happen to me?
I just know, that's all. I remember you from Central.
Am I bothering you?
Where are they?
I don't know. he moved away.
Ooooo, you are smart. Just don't get too smart.
There are opportunities in life for gaining knowledge and experience. sometimes, in some cases. it's necessary to take a risk. I got to thinking. I'll bet a person could learn a lot by getting into that woman's apartment. you know. sneak in and hide and observe.
Great. I'll pick you up around eight o'clock. Is that good?
I'll drink to that.
Why not?
Leave it in the front of your house for me. okay?
Look. it can wait till Sunday.
He got a little jealous.
That's what I thought.
Why are there people like Frank. Why is there so much trouble in this world.?
I guess so. you want to help me watch Frank?. I'm going to stake out Frank's place tomorrow. with a camera.
You want to go talk to him?
Number one. I saw the Yellow Man go into Frank's building, laughing with Frank. Now. the only trouble is. what does this prove?
Oh yeah?
Yeah. I think so. I just had to tell him some of what I knew. Is Friday still on?
I'd rather not talk about it. I'll tell you about it sometime.
I like that idea. that's a real good idea.
Let's wait for some slow one.
Dorothy Vallens?
uh uh.
Jeffrey, when you see your father.
Do you want the car?
I mean. some guys play anyway but they usually get slaughtered.
Yeah, I know.
Yeah, nice meetin' yuh.
I don't know.  He sent me.  I'm George.
Where do you guys want to count?
You'll see for yourself.
Derek!
I'm telling you, Derek, it will sell.
Are you kidding?
I feel like shit.  Me and my frigging nosebleeds.
Nice first impression.  A nose bleed in front of your parents.
What?  You're not going to wait for me?
Man.  Fuck you guys.  I have this great idea and you guys have to be all skeptical.
Yes, I am.
Something about vengance being best served cold.
What?  Yeah, sure.
You're kidding, right?  That's a hundred pounds a week.
Nice doing business with you, George.
I don't want to talk about it.
Never mind.  Not for you to worry.
Don't worry.  We will talk of everything.  We have the time.  You arrive here with a Bachelor of Marijuana, but you will leave with a Doctorate of Cocaine.
We'll refuel in the Bahamas.  I know someone there.
I can't go anywhere, Diego.  I'm on parole.  I can't leave the state.
And what happens when these guys stop paying?  Sooner or later, these guys are going to cut us out.  Then where are we?
Just sell it, Derek.
Shut up, Diego.  They're going to be here any minute.  I'm trying to concentrate.
Es un Ford blanco junto a una pick-up.
You went behind my back and you cut me out.
I don't know.  Maybe eighteen grams.
Today.
Oh, shut up, Fred.  Shut your big fat mouth.  You don't buy it all at once. It's called layaway.
I've seen those in magazines.  They're not cheap.
Mom.
Look at this credenza.  If you don't mind me asking, how much is something like that?  It's got to cost a fortune.
Yes, it is.
Yes.  Money.  Which is what, George?
Family.
Keep them coming?  Ah, yes.  Ha ha.  You are right.  But money.
Yeah, well, what are you gonna do?  You and me, Pablo?  Are we good?
That's too bad.  You would have been the first one in the family.
I'm going to California.
Tough spot.
Not mad.
Dad.
Yeah.  Listen.  I'm going to be going away for awhile.
Did you know I died two weeks after you sent me that tape?
What do you guys want?
Tuna.
Hello.
I don't think so.
I know who you are, El Americano. Mister George.
That's right.  Always spying, always judging.  Everyone's laughing at you, you fucking pussy.  You let Diego fuck you in the ass.  Maybe you are a fucking faggot.  You must be fucking Diego because you're not fucking me.
Yeah, so I've been thinking.  I love her, y'know?  I kind of want to have her.  I've been away for so long.  Make up for the missed time, you know?
Yeah, you will.  Of course.
What's happening to us?
Are we gonna split up?
Nothing.  I just wanted you to know I was out.  I just wanted to see you.
Dad.
You swear?
I don't believe you.
I know, Dad.  I love you too.
Yes, he's sitting right there at the end of the table.
Yeah, but what are you doing out here?
Who speaks Spanish?
Georgie, oh man, hold the mayo!
That's right.
Cheer up, man.  Half this money is ours. We're fucking rich.
The successes obtained are the results of those methods. One presupposes the other and vice versa.
And here?
C'mon ... you're exaggerating. The orders were to shoot him in the back.
Not enough.
Let's try ...
No, they'll do even more. We've given them the opportunity to do a lot more ... Do you understand what I mean? Starting tomorrow, they won't be groping in the dark any more; every shop and every worker who strikes will be a known enemy, a self-confessed criminal ... And they will be able to pass to the offensive. Have you thought of this?
Yes ... But let me first see you.
I just wanted to introduce myself and inform Miss Lawson that there will be an inquiry.
We know Marsh had a head cold.   We found cocaine mixed with water in a nasal spray container on the nightstand.  The coke would contract the nasal membrane the same as any decongestant, but for a much shorter time.  He'd keep using more and more -- never knowing what he was taking.
Very poor.  He was suffering from severe arterial disease.
Yes.
Yes -- those of Mr. Marsh and a thumb print of Miss Lawson's.
Why didn't the State's investigation uncover Mr. Roston earlier?
You may call your next witness.
Marsh left her close to three million dollars in his will.  That's motive. She admits to being there the night of his death.  That's opportunity -- and her fingerprints are on the nasal spray bottle.
Because she's clever.  Because she knows that even if we didn't find it we'd have suspicions as to why a man in Marsh's condition would use cocaine.
The M.E.'s report stated that Marsh's nasal membranes showed no sign of prior cocaine use.  Without the nasal spray we would have still treated it as a poisoning.  We would have looked for motive and the trail would have still led back to her.
Your Honor, I'm trying to establish a pattern in Dr. Paley's behavior with women.
That's correct -- but Andrew never told me he had a heart condition.  He said he had a heart arrhythmia and it was nothing serious.
No -- never.
Yes.
No.  She stopped by to pick up some papers.
It was wild.  She was constantly trying to get me more and more worked up -- kinky things.  I tried to satisfy her the best I could, but it was difficult in my condition.
She left me.
It was like she was trying to push me as far as she could.  She called it opening new doors.
What would she do that made it hard to resist?
At a dinner party -- about eight months ago.
Yes -- several times.
Well -- I realized that she wasn't interested in me.  She was just trying to get information out of me.
She said that those weren't any good -- because their use would be detected and the police would know the victim had been poisoned.  She wanted to know if there was a drug that would induce a heart attack but could also be used to enhance a sexual high.
No.
And the argument was about the fact that you wanted to be romantically involved and she did not.
No further questions.
I tell them to pour an amount the size of a quarter into the their hand and mix it with water.
Then -- those are not your own words?
What else did the District Attorney's Office tell you to say?
I'm a nurse.  I used to work at Roseburg Memorial Hospital.  Dr. Paley's on staff there.
What changed?
I don't know.  It's incredible to think that anyone could be capable of doing that -- but if anyone could it would be Rebecca.
Andrew was a kind and gentle man, but he was thirty years older than her. Where's the attraction to sleep with someone like that -- to have the kind of sex they had.
Yes -- cocaine.
Yes--  It was on a Friday.  I remember because I was going to visit my sister for her birthday.  It would be October twenty-eighth.
He said that if it kept up she was going to kill him.  That his heart couldn't take it.
You resented the fact that she told you what to do in Mr. Marsh's house?
No!  Why would I want to kill him?
You know I can't talk about that.
And she left shortly after that?
Not a very good one I'm afraid.
Andrew hardly needed leading.  He was a very passionate man.  He was eager to explore.  I gave him what he wanted.  We fulfilled each others needs.
We're not animals.
I thought the subject was sex?
Yes.
Not true.  Shall I tell you what you were thinking?  You were wondering if I was wearing anything under my skirt.
Hi.  It's Frank.
I just wanted to see if my secretary called to confirm your appointment tomorrow.
Great.  I'll see you at the office at nine.
It won't be that hard.
What?
I don't know, Frank -- but don't you think that's something we should find out?
Of course.
No -- you're not.
How's it supposed to work Rebecca? You and Paley celebrate your victory. You get me over here and provoke a fight so he has to rush in and save you -- but then he's given himself away as your accomplice -- now he has to kill me.  After that I figure she'll tell the Police that you broke in.  That you were crazed because we humiliated you in court?
She allegedly humped him to death?
Yeah.
Mr. Cardenas, I suggest you move on to another line of questioning.
Mr. Roston?
I'm always open to learning new things.
I'll talk to him later.
That's too bad.
Not even if they're a dork.  You should go by and see how he's feeling.
We have a witness who saw you go into the house at four thirty.
No -- never.
We were here two Christmases ago.
It's not that long.
SO!
Doesn't matter. Move on.
I said NO!
No treasure maps, huh?
Well, there's a problem.
Well, I don't care if it's legal or not, we're not cremating her and throwing her all over some bridge where we can't even go visit her because she's going to be blown all over the place like an ashtray.
Goddamn sonofabitch! I don't want to hear anymore! Sonofabitch! Burn the damn thing! I don't want to hear it! Throw it away!
Well, he just gets on about how if mama ever needed him, she could find him through the National Geographic magazine. He as a photographer. He promises not to write again. Then all it says is...  I love you... Robert.
Oh, he did not. He's such a nice guy.
I don't think so. Not yet anyway. And besides, something like that doesn't make you a bad person. He reminds me of Steve in a way. Steve's weak, immoral and a liar but he's still a real nice guy. He just shouldn't be married.  At least not to me. You getting hungry? I'm hungry.
And do what? Live alone? Go back to school? Find someone else? Start a magazine for confused woman? ... What if I can't do any of those things?
Yeah. But I thought she died.
You're right -- that is sick.
They got heat in Michigan.
Oh, honey. I'm so sorry. But you've got to be grateful for even feeling the little you've be given. Believe me. Go to him. Don't let him leave without these new precious hours you've got left. And if you need anyone to cry on, you know where I am.
Oh, that'll be nice.
No. I was just going to have some iced tea then split the atom, but that can wait.  I just have to get my shoes.
Long.  You just got off the train and stayed without knowing anyone there?
Want another cigarette?
Francesca.
I guess. Except I'm one of the people it frightens.
Why?
And clean.
I think so.
I'm kind of obsessed by it, actually.
No. I wouldn't say that. National Geographic isn't exactly the hub of artistic inspiration. They like their wild life in focus and without any personal comment. I don't mind really. I'm not artist. I'd faced that a long time ago. It's the course of being well-adjusted. I'm too normal.
Well, let's just call it a compliment and move on.  Did you love teaching?
No, you rub it on you. I have some in the truck. Don't go away.
You want to go back in?
What?
Not at all. I wasn't around much... So why did I get married? Well, I thought it was a good idea at the time. Have a home base. Roots. You can get lost moving around so much.
I'm a loner, I'm not a monk.
I embrace Mystery. I don't know what's coming. And I don't mind.
No.
No. But I love them just the same.
What made you ask such a question?
Yes! Hi.
The light was fading. Huh-huh.
Oh, hi. Look, I'm running a little late, but I'll still...
The cashier at the general store was very dangerous.
Sure.
Yes, that'd be nice.
How about Italy?
How about Bari?
Have you ever been to that station?
You know that little place nearby with the striped awning that sells sandwiches and little pizzas...
Trouble. Why?
Well, I just want to know the procedure. I don't want to upset your routine. Do you want any jam?
Yes. Absolutely. You have this habit of not needing and that it's hard to break. I understand.  Of course, in that case, why sleep -- you don't need rest or for that matter eat, you don't need food.
You won't be made to feel! Period. You've carved out this little part for yourself in the world where you get to be a voyeur, a hermit and a lover whenever you feel like it and the rest of us are just supposed to feel so incredibly grateful for the brief time you've touched our lives! Well, go to hell! It isn't human not to feel lonely -- it isn't human not to afraid! You're a hypocrite and you're a phony!
WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH IT?
Francesca, listen to me. You think what's happened to us happens to just anybody? What we feel for each other? How much we feel? We're not even two separate people anymore. Some people search their whole lives for it and wind up alone -- most people don't even think it exists and you're going to tell me that giving it up is the right thing to do? That staying here alone in a marriage, alone in a town you hate, in a house you don't feel apart of anymore -- you're telling me that's the right thing to do!?
TO HELL WITH YOU!
Yes. And I've accepted.
Kinda pretty. Is this uh... jazz kinda singing?
Later. Go back to sleep.
Frannie.
I'm going to miss you.
Cremated?!
Yeah.  He lived there.  And died there, too.
The man said just to use my imagination.  Let's see...yeah, I get it.  Potential. I can see it now.  The first major urban theme park.  Village Ghetto land. Kinda like Legoland, but made entirely from broken glass, hypodermic needles and crack vials.  Totally E-ticket.
What the hell you talking about?
Damned if I know.
Fine.  But I'm bringing a couple of friends.
Climb out to where?
But that's your old hood, Pops.
Ain't no big thang.  It's just a po' man's free base.  Here, check it out.
Don't need luck tonight.  I'm just letting 'em have their say before I say no.
Hush, baby.
Go easy on Jay Bird.  I can remember when we was his age...
Then fuck it!!!
You said bad things hurt places.  So maybe good things heal them.  Good things are happening here.  Maybe for the first time ever.  And maybe that's all it takes.
Who?
I don't.  Patrick doesn't.  And his brother and sister don't.  And they're in the house with him.
Mother!  No.
I manage them.
That place is already bad luck.
No.  It goes way back.  Or so my Momma says.
My momma says every house is two houses. Every street, two streets.  There's a whole city, a whole world, kinda beside, on top, just below this one.  The city of the dead.
Yeah.  But when something bad happens, something really bad -- the wall breaks. The fabric tears.
Okay, okay.  Listen:
You got the shit?
Fuck it.  Alright.
Can't be done.  That place already died and gone to hell.
Like you always said, Pop, look for the undervalued.
Sure, son.  I went down there and torched the place myself.
Dad?
Get that car the hell away from here, now!  I spend a lot of money to keep the cops cool.  But this is the kinda shit that pisses everybody off.
Not that I remember.
"This is Patrick..."  "...And this is Patrick on crack." Imagination, my butt.  Even the space cowboy can't...
Then your father's a dead man and Jimmy Bones is gonna be around a long time.
You hear that, bitch?  Be quiet!
That you overreacted.  That you lost it.  Not me.  It was your mistake.
Yeah, I know.
No!
No shit.  Bianchinni hired you?  You know he's a good friend of mine. |Family, really.
All right, Caesar.
Caesar ...
For Christ's sake, Johnnie, do what he says.
What happened to them?
Caesar, what are we going to do?
We're going to need some time.
You betrayed me!
You're blowing your only chance. Act like I'm Gino.
They were in a car accident.
They're all fine.  Just bruises and shit.
What are you going to do, V?  Shoot me?  Kill me in cold blood?  I don't think so.  I'll tell you why.  If you had it in you to pull that trigger, you would have done it a long time ago.  If I was you, I would have killed me the minute I brought the money home.  But you didn't and I know why, because you don't want to kill me.  Do you, V?  Do you? No, I know you don't.
Oh, right.
Good idea.
Where's the fucking money?
No.  Rajeev's in India.
Five.
Caesar, you still got the money?
Yeah, it was Violet's idea.  I was so wound up about Gino, she was trying to help me relax.
Oh Christ, the phone ...  That was a fucking stupid thing to do, wasn't it?
This is the police, ma'am.
Gunfire?  Is this a joke?
All right.
Yeah, sure.  I'm Corky.
Pretty much.  One day at a time.
No, it isn't your fault.  The walls here are just so thin.
Oh no, no.  I'm not the marrying kind.
He said you lost something.
What do you want?
Curious?  That's funny, I'm feeling a bit curious myself right now.
...  yes.
The redistribution of wealth?
I'm already in your bed.
If there is one thing I can't stand about sleeping with women, it's all the fucking mind reading.
I'm not afraid of anything.
I know!  You can't understand, because we're different, Violet.  We're different.
What are you saying?  That you don't have sex with men?
What about that guy this morning?
I think so, too.
Sounds like he wanted to get caught.
Mickey?
For what?
Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Do you have any idea what you are saying? You are asking me to help you fuck the mob.
Is that what you think?
To let it dry.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, twice.
Not much, really.  Caesar was nervous, kept cleaning the apartment.  |The first time, he picked out the dress he wanted me to wear.
The plane is in at seven, so I'd say about eight.
Waiting in the apartment next door.
Every job like this has moments where things don't go so well and everyone starts thinking about their own ass. It's in those moments that everything comes together or falls apart.
I won't.
No.
You are as radiant as ever, Violet.
Caesar?  What the fuck time is it?
Violet?
I told you, the family doesn't want the police around.  We want to take care of it ourselves and we will. I'll find him.  I swear I will.
I don't know what we're talking about.
I thought you were never going to do that.
I want a second opinion.
<u>No you're not</u>.  You're not going anywhere.  I'm shutting this down.
We'll make you better.  We can put the pieces back.  We can do that.
MPG Capital.
I know who sent you.  I don't know why.  I learned many, many things from the CIA.  <u>Many</u> things.  I learned the way they think.  Was the bomb on my boat supposed to go off or not?

Yes, I'm here...
Yes.  Is he there?
...I understand...
Did you?
Okay.
Oh, Jesus... 
Then I'll find another ride.
I know that.
I'm sorry.  Really.  What do you want me to do?
Yeah, well, welcome to the club.

No.
I kept trying things, I thought if I could find all the things I could do, I could --
Why do I? -- I come in here -- instinctively -- first thing I do -- I'm looking for the exit -- I'm catching the sightlines -- I know I can't sit with my back to the door --
I dream I'm asleep.  I dream that I'm asleep and I can't wake up.  I don't think I smoke.
Looks familiar?
Yeah.  Pull in here.  Park it.
All this stuff -- it's all about boats.  I think I'm in the shipping business.
Go ahead.
-- we can go -- I can get us out of here -- but we have to go now --
-- forget it --
I don't know what happened!  I don't know who he is!  I don't know what he wants!  I don't even know who I am!  The only thing I know is that if I stay here, I'm never gonna find out!
It's a name.  Mr. Wombosi owns a thirty million dollar yacht.  He's the proud owner of an Alliance Security package.  He also paid a visit to the morgue to see John Michael Kane. 
Go back to the hotel.

This your store?
So get the hell out of here.
-- slow down -- you can't just take the book like that --
What?
You're in danger.  All of you.  I have no time to explain.
What's that?
-- he accessed the account --
No.
I don't remember Zurich.
I don't know.
Got there!
Mumble ... Tuttle ...
You're putting your talents to very odd use Mr Lowry - yes, odd use - to pit wits against Central Services -
... new washer.
What? You mean you've got ...
What do I have to do.
I understand this concern on behalf of the tax-payers. People want value for money and a cost-effective service.
Sam, I think I ought to tell you ... I'm afraid she's upped stumps and retired to the pavilion.
Well, since you disappeared up the ladder of Information Retrieval ... I don't expect to see you slumming in Records - what's the problem?
Really? - God, how time flies!
Thanks. Are you officer 412/L?
Ah ...
I've got numbers all over these - I'm not sure which is the one you want.
How do you mean?
Not really, no.
She witnessed the Tuttle arrest - the Buttle arrest - and since then she's been making wild allegations, obviously trying to exploit the situation - she's working for somebody, and she's not working for us.
Look after that suit, eh. Barbara chose it for me.
Kindness? What's the purpose behind this line of enquiry?
Get her out of circulation - I've put her on the detention list.
Well, I ... Good point. What do you suggest?
We don't make mistakes.
Sam - we've always been close, haven't we?
Shut up!
What?
Have you got an Arrest Receipt?
Ah.
Oh, sorry.
What parcel?
A heavy Christmas present.
Who will?
You're joking.
"And your children all gone."
Go away.
Leave me alone!
Your face ... are you hurt?
Where are you going?
It's not our mistake!
Information Retrieval.
Expediting has put in for electrical procedures in respect of Buttle, Archibald, shoe repair operative, but Security has invoiced Admin for Tuttle, Archibald, heating engineer
I've told you before. I'd turn it down.
I've tried that! Population Census have got him down as dormanted, the Central Collective Storehouse computer has got him down as deleted, and the Information Retrieval have got him down as inoperative ... Security has him down as excised., Admin have him down as completed
Well, that's it! I may as well go and hang myself! This sort of thing couldn't have happened before the stupid seventh tier reorganization! That was Simmons doing! And he and Jeffries always sit together at lunch! The bastards!  Ow!  Perhaps we can lose it ... behind the filing cabinet ... or destroy it ... burn it ... eat it ...
Yes.  NO! You can't! You've only just turned it down! 
Yes.
You must be joking -  When there's a woman involved - there's no stopping me. Now, let me have that sheet.
There are some who go to Dr. Jaffe's clinic who never come back at all.
I'm sorry but ...
{suddenly unctious) Oh, but of course ...
This isn't rare!
Mother!
Of course. Isn't it wonderful? The bandages came of this afternoon. Come and join the fun. Everybody's here.
Mistake?
There was a slight complication. Dr. Chapman says it often happens with a delicate skin like mine. Nothing to worry about. He's promised me I'll have these bandages off in a ...
I think that'll hold it.  Hello Shirley. Just helping someone tie up a Christmas present. How are you?
Between you and me, Madam, today the number two.
It's too exciting. I've left Dr Jaffe and gone to Dr. Chapman.
Numero trois, steak.  Monsieur, Mesdames, Bon appetit.
Numero, trois.
Emergency procedures.
It's a 27B/6 of course.
What is this?  Who the hell are you?
What?
The paperwork, couldn't stand the paperwork.  Over to the left please, if you don't mind sir. Hold it there. Yes, there's more bits of paper in Central Services than bits of pipe - read this, fill in that, hand in the other - listen, this old system of yours could be on fire and I couldn't even turn on the kitchen tap without filling in a 27B/6.... Bloody paperwork.
Time to go.
No ...
Are you pregnant? Estas embarazada?
You can trust me on this one.
Two years. Ever since we left island.
He looks like a cop.
Sleeping in the back.
You're going to live.
Don't worry, hon. Young is here and he's gonna help out--just remember, you owe me.
Ten-four, hon.
Male diff breather, approximately 30, Houston and A.
No way, man.
What's his name?
I can't. I have to stay with my patient.
Yeah?
What?
I know him. That's Noel.
You never know.
Yes.
Hello, I'm Frank Pierce, from the ambulance last night. I brought your father into the hospital and I just learned some news.
Well, the doctor says he's showing some movement. It's still early, it might mean nothing, but I thought you'd want to know.
You look so different.
I was just going to get some food. Pizza. Maybe we could.
You remember that pizza place, Joe's on Tenth Street maybe fifteen years ago?  When you ordered a pie it came with a little plastic madonna in the middle?
Ah, no. I was.  It's hard to explain. She had a hard time adjusting to, well, maybe it was my fault too.
How long you been doing this?
Wow, you musta seen some things, huh? What's the worst thing you ever seen?
Nothing's going to happen. I'll come with you.
Because you can barely walk.
I need to sit down a minute.
He'll be all right.
I think the worst is over.
He's dead unless you folks want to stop bullshitting me and tell it straight. Then, Lord willing, we'll try to bring him back.
I'm hungry too. We gotta get some food after this.
What's wrong.
Here's to the greatest job in the world.
I quit! I'm through!
I wanted to bring them in, to see if he'd respond to voices, but they weren't in the waiting room. The guy's daughter was in my face all last night and when I finally have something positive to tell her, she's gone.
Can't tell. It was a breech, twins. The other one seems okay, though. Marcus is taking him and the mother to Maternity.
What do you do, just have someone follow him around with a defribilator?
Crazy fucker.
You have to keep the body going until the brain and heart recover enough to go on their own.
You want some bum in the bus terminal? We'll wait for a real call.
What do you want to break?
Okay, whatta I do?
You learn that in the army?
You're crazy.
You're burned out.
It's not our job to taxi drunks around.
He's drunk.
Faster!
Relax, will you.
You have no sick time, Frank. No time of any kind. Everyone knows that.
Sure, I'm taking the captain's exam next year. After the kids are in school, Louise can go back to the post office and, I thought, what the hell, I'll start my own medic service. Out on the Island the volunteers are becoming salaried municipal. It's just a matter of time and who you know. Someday it's going to be Chief Larry calling the shots.
Used to be my partner.
Yeah.
You write this?
Great.  Network news, Washington... I love it.  What do you do when your real life exceeds your dreams?
You know the other day I really wanted your reaction to how we did with the Libyan report -- I was going to ask but I guess I feel a little intimidated with you.
Can you name all the members of the Cabinet?
What?
Sit on it!  <u>Now</u> look.
Oh, God, no!
Yeah -- well, I'm sorry I'm tying up Jane, I didn't realize you two would be going this late.  Sorry.
It is.  Yes -- that's where they had Rorish, for God's sake, before they made him anchor.  I can't stand it -- they're grooming you for it all and you don't even know it.
No, I liked the way it made me sound. Okay.  Be good.  So long.
I'll see you back at the hotel.
Yes.
Office Bimbo.  No, I'm sorry.
I don't like the word gay.
At six o'clock on the wake-up news they used the wrong missile graphic.
A half hour in the lobby.
Why do you say that?
Good night.
Eleven and a half.
We can cut back at the end.
Not because you have to.
Which means I'm at their mercy and who wants that?...I'm not going to tell you where this thought led me... Anyway, well, why not  tell you? -- it's a happy thing.  In the middle of all this I start to think about something that does nothing but make me feel good and makes immediate sense and that's you ...And I'll stop here but, Jane, I'd give anything if you were two people so I could call up the one who's my friend and tell her about the one I'm in I...I don't think I should go any further.  Come on -- I'll walk you to the corner.
Absolutely...You go have a good time... You have some place to go?
Well, the line of the jacket -- No really....just very nice...just right. I wish I could be there.
No.
No!!!!!
Let me think a second.  It's tough.
This isn't friendship.
Because we have the kind of relationship where if I were the Devil, you'd be the only one I told.
Sit down, stop.
Hi.  Will I ever sing again?
Stop.  Ernie thought I was good too -- he couldn't help.  My agent has a hot prospect -- the number two station in Portland.  The general manager says he wants to be every bit as good as the networks.  Personally, I think he should aim higher.
I hope so...  No.  I'm not really mad.  I'll miss you, we'll talk, we'll always be friends...we'll get hot for each other every few years at dinner and never act on it, okay?
In front of a little -- it's a bit... You want a mirror?
Do one thing to me?  Get me one shot at anchoring the Weekend News -- they've never seen me do it.  I think it could turn them around.
I understand.  I'll go with you.
Move away from me.
Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuckes.  Snot... Fuckee.  You want to use that?
You can make it a little less brutal by knocking a million dollars or so off your salary.
I'll speak to you soon
Yes, there is.
Yes?
I spent a fortune on this.
No stop where he's all besieged.
I know...I mean you didn't do anything special for me tonight.  You just had what I think are good manners, decency. And it really makes me want to be nice back and it has nothing to do with any homosexual thing.  Honestly.  Because I don't know if you've homosexual or not and -- you're not, are you?
Not impressed exactly -- but a break in the clouds.
No.  Really...don't worry about it.
I'll speak to you.
I don't know.
Proud?  I'm just embarrassed that I like when they say those things.
It's not.
No, it's awful.  Oh my, it's awful.
How are you at back rubs?
I trust you.
No.  Aaron and I go to Central America on Wednesday -- so I'm cramming.
How's it going?
Yes.
Ah, I don't want any credit.  Bobbie and I serve anonymously.
Well, thumps like me leave appearance to guys like you.
Yes.  Just don't say anything mean for a while.  Thanks.
Okay.
What?
Well, what is it?
Yes, Tom -- I think I can manage.
Jane, yes.  Tom?  Tom, is that you? Is this Tom?
Oh, good.
I like you as much as I can like anyone who thinks I'm an asshole.
Well, when?
I'll see you at the office.  Good night.
He -- uh -- said he liked you because you looked like you had -- fire and honesty.
That it would be a treat to make someone like you feel better... He gets like that sometimes.
I saw the taped outtakes of the interview with the girl.  I know you 'acted' your reaction after the interview.
Jesus, if you're glib about this I'm going to lose it.  I was up all night and...
Working up tears for a new piece cutaway...You totally crossed the line between...
It's amazing.  You commit this incredible breach of ethics and you act as if I'm nitpicking.  Try and get this.  When you edited that...
What I don't know, I can learn and what I know, nobody can teach. Excuse me for saying it about myself, but I think it's true.  What do you think?  Never mind what you think.
Right back to you.
I'm sorry.
I'm going home!
I wanted to apologize for being nasty to you this evening.
I decided to make a female figure after all!  I want you to pose for it.
Alright I got you, man.  It's my turn for freak patrol.
Everyone wants to meet the bus boy.
Yeah it was all just an accident.
Me too.
Now you're a professional!
Oh...
Here here...
Walter!  Jeez!
Yes Walter.
You think I'm creative?
I thought you did on account of you kissed me the other night!
Jeez, what is your problem all of a sudden?
I hope this was made with egg whites!
What are you doing here so early?
I'm totally serious!
Yes...I'm uh...I'm fine.
Listen, I'm going over to Walter's after the place closes.  I want to get a look at Murdered Man.  Do you want to come along?
That's the idea, Walter.  It's the only way to gain recognition. All the big art critics and art dealers would be there, it would be an event.
I know.
I think he's looking for you, man... it's all finally catching up with you!
Yeah, right outside the door!
Well it sure looks dead enough.
Yes they are, aren't they?  Look, why don't you take the rest of the night off, you look tired.
What am I doing?  I'm just telling Walter the truth.
I-I already got a new one!
You want me to open a window or something?
It was.
Just wait till you see this!
Put it down, Walter.
Yeah?
I can't talk right now.
No...look I'm busy...
I'm holding for Lieutenant Beldere!
Uh, sure.
Yeah I did.
Alaska!  What the heck's wrong with it!
You're coming downtown with me, Walter.  You're gonna come clean with me, you're gonna name names or I swear to God I'll see to it personally you rot in a cell upstate! Are we understanding each other?
I liked it very much Mr. Brock. I liked it very much.
Really?
T-turned on?
If you were my son...why don't you let me fix you a nice hot bowl of soup, it won't take but a minute.
Noise Mrs. Swicker?  What noise?
The other two -- the new ones. Where are they?
He's got a...  What do you call it? A Napoleonic Code.
Oh, yeah.  But I still want to know what happens.
Bummer metaphor.
You didn't like them.
No offense, man, but I think you're on something nasty.  Why don't you just go and cool out and I'll see you in the morning or something.
You don't mean, like, a cheerleader?
Down there.
What's playing there?
Yeah, I guess.
Eeyuu.
Uum... around ten?
I don't know, Mom; I've never met Bobby.
It's the news, Buffy.
I just want to see the basketball scores.  It's important.
Nothing.
No...
You guys are thrashed.
Water.  Okay.
Yeah.
Yeah, I was bailing.  I have a friend, and he's really... well, he's really vampire, I guess.  Bad scene.
I think I could help.  You gonna tell me you don't need help?
Merrick...
A dress.
But, Buffy, you're the guy, the chosen guy.
Benny was right.  You guys are all exactly the same.
Pretty shallow of you.
You say that like it's a bad thing.
'One that reflects the students' growing awareness of and involvement in the world around them.'
Okay, guys, how about the ozone layer?
Where?
I forgot.
This isn't important?  The earth is our home.
I know.  I like your little outfit.
I'm sorry.  That was impressive. The...  tumbling.
Not at all.  My name is Merrick.  I was sent to find you some time ago. I should have found you much sooner but there were...  complications. You should have been taught, prepared.
I've searched the entire world for you, Buffy.
You must come with me.  It's much too late already.  You must come with me to the graveyard.
Wait!
Yes.
Lothos.
I have to show you.
Cramps?
Our purposes.
There's a great deal I have to show you, I'm not even sure where to start  There's so little time.
We're going to have the work hard. You'll need some excuse for staying out.  For your parents.
Good Lord.  What do you study in history?
Oh.
Try to pay attention.
I can't work this.
Make time, okay?  You're the one who told me to act normal.  I've missed three practices already.  If I'm not there for the Barber game tomorrow everyone's gonna talk.
You're learning.  Slowly, incredibly slowly, but you're learning.
Cassandra, you gotta come, too.
I'm just a girl.
No --
But --
He is so bald.
Can't they make exceptions?  Maryanne Heinel?  She's such a scud.  Can't we have a Maryanne clause?
I am.
Honey, don't ever listen to a woman when she's making love. They'll say the strangest things.
There is a lot of things you never thought of, sweetie--now get some rest for tonight's game.
I'm really beat.  I need some serious "z's"--
If I throw too hard I'll hurt the kid.
Oh don't be silly.  Death is nothing to be scared of.  It's just another way of living.  It's just a fresh start--kinda like spring training.
Yes.  And so is birth.  Now look me in the eyes, Nuke--  You haven't been wearing my panties, have you?
Y'know, Annie, I been thinking if it works for one game, maybe it'll work for a whole buncha games.
Not that.  I mean the re-channeling of my sexual energy.  Maybe we shouldn't make love for awhile.
No, that's okay.  All I need's a little nap.
Sure.  Unsnap my stockings.
Yes I do...
I'm trying to play with your body!
I'll be back when we lose.
Oh--won't YOU come in?
--but you're father's in there!
Yeah, Skip, it's me.  Jeez...Jeez...God...Jeez...
I won't be needing these anymore.
I think I'm ready for the Show.
"I didn't get lured and I will take responsibility for my actions".
No, no--I'm fine.  Millie, how much time did you and Jimmy spend together before he proposed?
Crash, I didn't think you--
What do you believe in?
Let me.
Nuke won't go to bed with you, eh?
I'm ready for a complicated man.
I was raised in a Baptist church got dipped in the water when I was 5-- born again before kindergarten...by the time I was 10 I knew it was bullshit and at 15 I ran away from home...
What's so great about baseball?
It's true, It's true!  Least it used to be true.  It ain't possible that baseball's not enough anymore, is it, Crash?
Whatta you mean "why not"?  Are you gonna play forever?!
He looks great, just great!
Ninety-five miles an hour...
Oh let's not...
Who's he play for?
Never heard of 'em.
Chicken bone cross take the curse off this bat and bring me hits.
C'mon, God damn it, gimme some!
No!  I said It was a cock-sucking call and you can't run me for that!
You spit on me!
Beg me again!
I wanta throw the heater to announce my presence with authority.
Go for it.
If he had a good breaking ball, I'd respect the shit outta him.
I know, I know--I have that dream all the time.  We're almost home.
Annie's a smart lady.
It'll keep the fear of God in the hitters.  Trust me.
Shut up.  I'm playing.  Oh you won't regret it, young girls don't forget it, lost in their own wilderness ...  But it's all so easy--Just try a little tenderness...
Okay, I'll kick your ass there.
You know what the difference Is between hitting .250 and hitting .300?  1 got it figured out.  Twenty-five hits a year in 500 at bats is 50 points.  Okay?  There's 6 months in a season, that's about 25 weeks--you get one extra flare a week--just one--a gork, a ground ball with eyes, a dying quail-- just one more dying quail a week and you're in Yankee Stadium!
My right.
No.
What're you thinking about out here, Nuke?
Throw it.  C'mon, right in the chest.
I was thinking I could fly up and spend a week in the Big Leagues with you--help you get comfortable.
We'll be praying for you.
--we had the gun on him tonight-- the last five pitches he threw were faster than the first five. 96 miles an hour, 98, 97, 97. 97.   He's got the best young arm I've seen in 30 years.
Even if it's the Carolina League-- this is a chance to play everyday.
Look, guys--I'm a man, I got needs too.  I understand this party-- but...  sex is the one thing you can get further behind in and catch up faster than anything I know.  There's a baseball lesson in there somewhere.  Where's Crash?
Jim looking for somebody.
I'm Nuke LaLoosh.  With the Bulls.
They called me up to the Show and I wanta tell Crash goodbye.
...he did what he was told.
But you can't just fire him. Webb's his brother-in-law. He's County Commissioner.
Good to see ya.  William would you...
Was I at that dinner? Just tell me -
Was I at that dinner?
This is a very auspicious occasion.
On behalf of the Teamsters' Pension Fund, it is my pleasure to present to you . . .
...this check for $62,700,000 for the new Tangiers.
It's a pity in this...
What do you propose?
Yeah.
He was a moocher, a card cheat, a country-club golf hustler. A scumbag... chasing dentists for a few bucks.
...Rothstein. I want to talk to Ginger. Put her on the phone.
Matter of fact...
I don't care. I want to get away from back home for a while. I'm tired of that shit back there.  Look at this place. It's made of money. You know what the best part is? Nobody's gonna know what we're doin'! There's nobody here to see us! Everybody's back home.
Be careful. Gaming agents are all over the place.
You been lucky all week. They're lookin' to nail ya.
No.
Then he called me a faggot.
I gotta do somethin'. I gotta do somethin'. They ain't gettin' rid of me. They're not gettin' rid of me. I'm staying here. Fuck 'em. Fuck 'em.
Listen...
Well, it's okay. I'll use the service entrance. I'll see you at nine.
I'm not tryin' to tell you what to do. But you were way out of line, Nick. What're you doin'? Where's your head?
I don't wanna come along with you.
I don't wanna be involved in anything you're talkin' about...
Yeah.
Your fuckin' head is getting' bigger than your casino. That's your problem, pal.
Fuckin' walking around with a big head. You better check yourself...
Practice enough this week, you prick?
What people?
I don't even know what you're talkin' about, Nick.
I -
I'm only on TV because I gotta be able to hang around the casino. You understand that. You know that. Come on.
Yeah.
And what'd she want?
Yeah, she's with that cocksucker again... and they got Amy.
She's driving me fuckin' crazy.
No, I'm not okay.
I want to just talk. I want to talk to that Irish bitch.
Yeah? Nicky, I want to talk to that fuckin' bitch.
I'm sorry, I can't do anything. He's too incompetent. And the bottom line is, he cannot be trusted.
I'll come by.
They were ready to blame him for anything, no matter where it happened.
Good to meet you.
...as soon as Andy got back home, Nicky heard about our talk in the car.
Next morning bright and early, I get the call.
Hello, Jennifer, it's Sam -
I-I'm sorry, Sam.
Certainly.  Senator.
I don't care what she is. She's an institution, that's the problem. She's lazy.
What is it?
Who's this?
Hey, Mitch.
Thank you.
Thanks a lot.
We're not getting any younger. Don't you think it's time? Aren't you gettin' tired of all this shit? Bangin' around, hustlin' around?
I'm forty-three years old. I don't want to wait. I know you well enough to know that I really love you very much.  And I can't think of anybody better to be with. And I don't feel like waiting anymore.
Yeah, I know all that.
I - I - I...
Just what I said. You'll be set up for the rest of your life. That I can promise you.  Want to take a chance?
Yeah.
I'm aware of that. We don't have to turn this into a big deal.  Okay? We don't have to have a fight. It was important to me. But forget it. Just something I wanted to do for myself.
Look - Sam, I've been independent my whole life. I never had to ask anybody for anything. Now you're making me beg you for this.
You can trust me.
Yeah, how do I know?
Okay, okay.
...on the stuff involving crimes. So on...
Yeah, they're gonna kidnap my kid. What do you want?
Hi, it's me.  Just who you wanted to talk to, right?
What's it...
Pretty serious.
It's, uh, it's under twenty-five.
And...
He wanted a watch, too.
Mm-hm.
But even if you bought him a watch, a really nice watch, one that he thought was nice - and he doesn't know what the fuck a good watch is - so, you go, five, ten, twelve grand?
Would you knock it off, Sam?
Fuck you!
You're stoned. You're a junkie. Get out of here.
What did Jennifer have?
Mm.
Who were you with?
I should have -
Listen to me.
You understand? What? Let you go?
So what? So who fuckin' blew you in the parking lot before you came in... huh?
What are you running for, Bob? What are you running for?
In a  Wild and unprecedented outburst that followed his gaming license  denial, Rothstein followed several...
Eight children! 
Listen to me very carefully. There are three ways of doing things around here. The right way, the wrong way, and the way I do it. You understand?
I really think you're -
Green?
I'm just curious. I saw you shuffling your checks with your right hand. Can you do that with both hands?
All right, I'm gonna give you a choice. You can either have the money and the hammer or you can walk out of here. You can't have both. What do you want?
Yeah?
Thanks, Nick.
Well, I keep layin' out my own fuckin' dough for these trips and nothin' ever comes back. I mean, what hell's goin' on? What are we doin' over here?
Hi. Good.
Well, I've been busy. 
Listen... Nicky... we talked about this... and, uh, I explained to you that there was the possibility you might have to take some kind of loss.
I can't.
Mr Rothstein, why don't we just let her in the house and get a few of her things?  That way she'll get out of here. This is half her house anyway.
She's on the account. There's nothing we can do.
Ace got my son, little Nicky, involved with Little League, and it was great.
Yeah, well, that's exactly what I keep tellin' him, but that's the kind of kid he is ever since he's born.
He tries to do everything...
Fuckers!
Why, does it look like it's bothering me? What do I give a fuck?  Fuckin' Oscar too. All the fuckin' money I've given that prick, he don't even look over here. What's his problem?
He's gone?
Carmine's gone.
What?
What're you gonna do?
It's private... but I want you to tell me the truth.
Ma che cazzo!
But I knew how to keep the bosses happy. Whenever they gave me little jobs to do, you know, to send a message, I would carry things out...
Am I right?
So, he put aside some jewelry for me. A lot of jewelry.
I do.
It's all right.
No, I really do. I think he's gonna kill me.
I don't - 
I did what you told me to.
'Cause you always tell me the right thing to do.
Come on. Don't be scared.
What about my money?
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.  Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
Ginger, honey.
What's the matter?
What money? I've seen you stealing from me.
Get lost?
Come on! 
Promise?
So, he knows where you are. That means he's sending some guys over here probably right now.
Listen...
Oh, there aren't?  What's that?  Huh? What's that.  There's no more. Thanks, hon.
Two.
What a smart kid you are!  Okay, eat.
'Cause you're a jag-off. I would have fuckin' made you lay ten...
Hold it, hold it. Here.
Get up.
What, are you gonna have a fuckin' meeting here, or are you gonna buy some diamonds?
Fuckin' Jews stick together, don't they?
Ch-Charlie M!
Hey.
Well, I'm a little confused here.
Yeah, I know, that's why you had it ready. You thought I was fuckin' layin' it?!
I didn't curse. I said 'frickin' head'.
...behind my head. They trust that scumbag, I don't. Right now, the way I feel, I'll hit the two of them in the head with a fuckin' shovel.
All right, all right. But I - I -
You are right. What can I...
Ayy!  Some cat's blocking the periscope.  Somebody, give it a swat...
Oops--my face must match my cape. And to think we were going to let you go...
Kincaid got a little frisky last night...So, meet here at eight and go from there?  By the way, I'm Brock Leviathan.
What did you think?
What little boy doesn't...  My God...it's, it's...Catwoman.
Somewhere very far away, very quiet, and very...  This is all wonderful, Selina, but...But I'm afraid I can not rest until all my sister's killers are brought to justice...That one-armed monster..
Your uniform, that first time I saw you, was a ghastly cage I vowed to unlock in order to..
Hey, speaking of Wrong Place, Wrong Time.  Lewis Lane to the rescue!
He didn't remember to roll up his window...
Resting Up?  Sorry Spooky, I've got to go with God on this one. I hate to think we're just in this for the money.  Garfield's girlfriend crossed a line last night and she's got to get spayed. We're going out of Oasisburg on a win.
That is not a man, Captain God. That is Vomit accidentally born with two legs.
Absolutely.
I hate it when you get like this. This Catwoman is becoming an obsession. I say we call it a night. Tomorrow is a big day for us...
It's a lot more fun than fighting violence with pamphlets. That voicebox of yours is a hoot. Say "I'm wearing no underwear"--it'll be funny..  You do know you're evil, don't you?
I still have one left...
Do you have any idea how much superheroes get paid?  Zilcho. Urban vigilantes with secret identities operating outside the law. Not exactly the stuff of a W-2 form.  If it wasn't for merchandising and corruption and these diabolical "missions"...There is no such thing as heroes and villains, anymore, Selina.  There are only winners and losers. You lost. We won.
Spear.
Can I be frank, Frank?  Your entire existence is sexual harassment. I accept there's not much you can do about it.
Enough.
About the same. Thanks for asking...Damn blender.  Okay, I can't stand it anymore, I'm dying to know--Did you try on some whiskers last night and hit a 7-11 along with all those other women? You had to have thought about it--a Catwoman for a night?
Uh-huh..
Fine, fine, at a later date, I'll be more than happy to talk about my perverse psychological complexities with the one who's not the creep. But for now, I'm drilling inside your brains...I bring up the whole Catwoman thing for one reason.  I bit Captain God in the hand and the next day you both show up equipped with big bandaids and wobbly excuses--  "My grandfather is inventing a new kind of blender.."
What if I say I'll go out with you, so you can have all these great daydreams, but then never actually talk to you again?
Yes, Mother. Dear.
Oh, I forgot to tell you, you're on a diet...The fact you're still reasonably pretty is the one thing you got going for you.
It's funny, I've heard of giving up finding a man and raising a family to pursue a career. And I've heard of foregoing a career to start a family-- but I think you're onto something new, Selina. "Absolutely nothing"-- Has a ring to it. I think it could catch on...How's that for sarcasm?
Trust me, you won't have to.
We met on the Internet. The Captain put out a cryptic message calling for a new order of crimefighters. We don't even know each other's true identities...
Thanks.
Don't you have children?
Taking messages.
You could've made me lose my call.
Then whose is it?
I'm sorry.  You'll do all right without me.  Keep my share.
I'm not staying in here with him puking all over the place.  Get this door open!
Why would I do that?
Yes sir.
I'm the one they'd be looking for.
Put those away.  We can't have marks on his wrists.
I'll see that he stays calm.  Pack the money up and put it in the trunk.
Bullshit.
Will you relax?  This in no way affects our business.  Go on.
That's what I deserve for listening in the first place.
Make a "U" and go back.
<u>You're</u> doing all the talk.
Go ahead then.  I'm covering the receiver.  She can't hear.
Satisfied, Wiseass?
We'll toss it when we make the blind curve.
You don't understand.
I'm sorry.  I'm so sorry to do this to you.
I realize you don't want to be involved.
I have no idea.  They put us in the back of a van with blacked out windows.  The shutters up here are nailed shut.
One of them <u>is</u> a cop.
He pulled us over as we left the Riviera Tennis Club.  Claimed we'd run a stop sign.  And when Elliot was reaching for his license --
I hear them coming upstairs.  I won't be able to talk for awhile. I have to lay the phone down and pretend to be asleep.  So don't talk.  Don't say a word or they'll hear it.
They know Jack will give them what they want once they have her.
Let me call the school -- tell them not to let her go.
He's right?  Look, don't try to put blood on my hands.  You've got one hell of a nerve siding with him!
Forget about us.  Just save Rachel.
How much time do you have left on it?
Pictures.
Lady, you don't have to keep up a running commentary.
I've lost you.  You're gone.  I can't hear anything.
Even if you found us -- what then?
The front door slammed.  Someone went out.  There's a different car starting.
Theo, I want you to know, you're probably the most decent man I've ever met.
Jack hasn't loved me for years. And now I'm afraid she's turning out to be like him.  So cold and distant.  I've let him make her like that.
Are you okay?
Put the man back on.
Yes.  But I want Rachel to come with me.
All right.  Now that you explain it I see that you're right.
Jack Oberfeld in person.  Did you kill him?
I thought it was inspired.
Why pick me to be your "mark?"
You knew about me.
There's no way out for you.  You have to deal with us.
You won't shoot me.  That's not your style.
Do you have to point that?
No, there's a police car way back there.  See it, in the distance coming around the turn?  The van is blocking it now.
I was sentenced to a youth camp out here when I was fourteen.  We cleared some of these same roads.
As a child I hated being told how sweet I looked.  That angelic little face wasn't me at all.  I had to hurt people to prove to them they had the wrong image. Sometimes words were enough -- but I wasn't beyond inflicting physical pain in order to be taken seriously.  I enjoyed seeing the shock on their poor faces when they realized who I was.  That same look you gave me when I turned the gun on you.
He might've heard everything we said in the car.
Nothing but CDs in there.  I thought maybe you'd like some Celine or Whitney.
That's a skill you acquire when you do fantasy phone sex for a living. I must've had thirty regulars salivating at 4.99 per minute.
You won't live to see it.
Who is this?
You're up on your details, aren't you?
There are no guarantees in this life.
A large stretch of empty space with no place to hide.  Temescal Canyon parking lot.
We don't see you.
It's your call.
Talk to the man.
I still don't see you.
Thanks for the sound advice.  Now ask the woman to get out of the van and walk over here.  Alone.
You'll still have the girl and the husband.
Better reassure him.
There's two police cars now.
My compensation!  Somebody still owes me -- big time!
Sweet revenge plus maybe a bit of vigorish off your end.
Five minutes.
Mind if I have a look?
Undercover.
Your partners are currently armed and we're not.  Our edge is that they don't know we're in touch.
Where is this canyon house where you're supposed to hook up?
How?
She's not a girl, Col --
Nice.
Ask him yourself.
Stop it, Dil --
It's him, isn't it?
Cunt.
Fucking mad!
No.
Hi. You forgot your bag.
No, I didn't --
Must be.
Jesus.
The things a girl has to put up with.
Tough guy, huh? Are you going to be all right on your own?
Yes, please.
How different?
Shouldn't I go?
Did you do that to him?
Want to look after you.
Yeah.
Depends what it is.
I'm wondering why you keep his things.
Dil --
You think that's wise?
Can't help it, Jimmy. A girl has her feelings.
So they do know.
Are you pretending yet?
I miss you, Jimmy.
Why, honey --
I can't.
I'm not sure.
Sorry. What you doing?
My pills...
I will be.
Jimmy?
Don't go like that.
You knew which man?
You knew my Jody?
You knew my Jody?
Did you hear me?
In a manner of speaking.
Stop it, Dil --
I like you, DIl
It's my name, Dil --
Do I?
I promise.
Stop it, Dil --
Carnations.
You're back in the pink, Tommy? How're you keeping?
Can't.
Someone's got to do it.
I heard.
Suits you.
No, what is the thing?
No way, Jude. I'm out.
Och, you do, Fergie.
Do you want a cup of tea?
And anyway, he's seen our faces.
And do you know why?
Because tomorrow we might have to shoot him, that's why.
Request permission to guard the prisoner tonight --
I'm sure.
Good. So what do you think?
Right.
Can't eat through a canvas bag.
How is it a farce?
My pleasure.
I can smell her perfume.
Could you?
Do what?
They're going to let that guy die. And you're going to kill me.
You want to bet?
Not in your nature.
No.
And you play cricket?.
Ever see hurling?
My pleasure, Jody
Yeah?
Having a pint in the Metro, and Dil's having a margarita.
We got simple tastes, you and me.
But you fellas never get a break, do you?
Some kinds of women are...
I told you not to talk that way --
How can I?
And the scorpion. No. Tell me anything.
Yeah?
Stop that talk now --
The fastest.
Hurling --
You'd know I wouldn't run off.
Who gives a fuck.
He believes in the future --
No, we are.
It's a toss-up, I can tell you that.
What about it?
Why do you think I brought you here?
How do you think I got here?
Relax -- you're gaining.
I've looked, Adam -- you know I have --
Let's look anyway.
No, it's all right. What's wrong, Adam?
With whom? Where?
It's Thursday today -- and it's almost five -- come on!
Stop grousing. If we find the money I'll buy you an international conference all your own. Now start looking. You take this side and I'll poke around over there.
Then who did? You're the only one left.
You lied to me so many times --
Can I really believe you this time, Adam?
Reggie -- listen to me --
Mrs. Lampert -- Mrs. Charles Lampert.
So that was it.
Because they're still here.
Agents.
No.
Well, if I'm going to die, I might as well do it for my country.
Oh, stop it. What do you want me to do?
No, I do -- it was the stamps on that letter Charles had with him on the train. They were in plain sight all the time, but no one ever bothered looking at the envelope.
Yes, I'm leaving now -- goodbye.
Do you know him, Mrs. Vo -- Mrs. Lampert? Leopold W. Gideon?
The last one, please.
We're not allowed to tell. May I have the stamps, please?
-- recommending that all Embassy offices be locked during the lunch hour.
Yes.
We wait -- with our mouths shut.
I said with the mouth shut.
You're out, Dyle -- right now!
The army thinks he was killed in action by the Germans, but I think they did it -- Tex, Gideon and Scobie -- and your husband -- because he wouldn't go along with their scheme to steal the gold. I think he threatened to turn them in and they killed him. I'm trying to prove it. They think I'm working with them. But I'm not, and that's the truth. I'm on your side, Reggie -- please believe that.
Would you like to see my passport?
Okay, I'll drive you around there some day.  Ouch!
Yes, but we're divorced.
Alex -- how can you tell if someone is lying or not?
Why couldn't you just look at his feet?
Oh. Well, then he's a truthful Whitefoot, of course.
Which one are you?
Tuesday.
Maybe.
No, about Scobie, I mean. I can't think of any reason why he was killed.
What makes you think that this somebody will be satisfied with three? He wants it all, Alex -- that means we're in his way, too.
No --
This is a ludicrous situation. There must be dozens of men dying to use my shower.
Have you ever heard of anyone taking a shower with his shoes on?  What a nut.
Do you mind if I sit down?  What about the blue one?
In money.
Here's ten.
What do you want?
Tell me what?
He didn't have one.
I don't know.
I don't know.
A letter? May I see it?
Oh.  Neither do I.  Voilà!
Up there! I would put it up there!
I don't blame him. Jean-Louis -- do you know where this Monsieur Félix lives?
Yes, I am -- I'm compulsive about it -- dishonesty infuriates me. Like when you go into a drugstore.
Well, you go in and you ask for some toothpaste -- the small size -- and the man brings you the large size. You tell him you wanted the small size but he says the large size is the small size. I always thought the large size was the largest size, but he says that the family size, the economy size and the giant size are all larger than the large size -- that the large size is the smallest size there is.
Well, the idea's right, anyway. Are you going to call me?
Charles is.
Charles sold it all -- at auction.
I don't know where to go.
Not too expensive -- I'm not a lady of leisure anymore.
No, everyone. Come on -- avanti, avanti!
Stop bullying me. Everybody's bullying me.
What was what?
How about once more around the park?
Then stop acting like one. If you're really in some kind of trouble, I'd like to hear about it. Otherwise, it's late, I'm tired and I'm going home to bed.
Yes, I'll remember. Good night.
Yes, ma'am. A little one -- 'bout seven or eight years old. Th' little tyke keeps callin' you his Aunt Reggie -- ain't that cute?
I admit I moved to Paris because I was tired of American Provincial,
Don't you want me to stay?
I'm Lisa Sherman. Dylan's aunt. He asked me to come talk to you.
I get the imports.
No.
So?
It won't happen again.
What's wrong?
Nothing. I just picked up the phone to say goodbye to you. You didn't say goodbye.
Run!
No. Let her get at least one more peacefully night's sleep.
This will relax her.
A bullet to the right cerebellum.
Couldn't tell she going to off herself, huh?
Yeah. You should check downstairs.
What are you doing here?
I knew you were a pervert. Always wearing those fucking doofy glasses, and driving a station wagon.
You know about that too?
Really?
He's a rapist. Like mine.
Why?
You are 'sp fucking' wrong.
But you can't do any of it. So it sucks. I always have to 'set an example'.
The phone just went dead. I called the police and ran right over as fast as I could.
FINE. Are you?
What party?
No.
Stag?
I can't right now.
Twenty eight years ago.
Everyone's getting ready for the party.
Why?
I did.
I'm so flattered but I can't. I'm grounded.
I'm not using him as an excuse.
Let's just start a party right here, right fucking now.
This party is sick.
The library. I'll be fine.
Attacked how?
And the police did nothing?
How could you?
Are you Jody?
His mother's side.
They're tasty.
Ok.
Yeah. I'm extremely worried about that. It's right up there with global warming.
If sheep don't count.
Oh...
Sam?  Andy gave Sam a nice big desk to park his fat ass behind.
Hey, I'm with you on that one, my man. Prick.
Well, Darlene usually gives me a signed check for emergencies.  I could always give you that.
 No.

...truck.
And if that Elvis shit...
I need your truck!

Yeah, to keep him off my ass.
I'm gonna stomp your a--
You'd better coast through...
Am I missing somethin' here?
I did not steal this truck!
I didn't steal the truck! He owed it to me!  Anyway, the important thing is I'm not goin' through Missoula!
That's...

Doesn't...
Hey, take a look at your situation and...
Hi--!  The gun was empty!
 
You  snatch that  phone  from me one more time, I'm--


Okay. 

 Oh...


Gimme that, gimme that, gimme that.
...man!
Taking it down the hill.
No!
Oh, no!

...piece of shit was worth.
...overdrawn bank accounts.
We were nationally  ranked.
Couldn't deal with it.  So I split.
Anyway, about ten months ago, I wound up in Jerome, workin' for Darlene.
...split.
...miles.
Like I said, I got a pretty good idea of what's at stake here.
...man.
Bring him down!
Are you all right?
We're gonna die!



Go, go, go! 


...-ful?!
What the--?
What?

It's working.
 There's gotta be...



Excuse me.  I got a bullet in my leg.
...I feel that my government owes me a little restitution.
I was not in the man's face.  I was nego-...
Look.  That's negotiating? He threatened to kill...
...about him.
I don't ever wanna see another ice cream...
Oh, my God.
And it won't be pleasant. 

We do need your truck.

...-lem too?
...owe you.
In order to protect those secrets, I am authorized to fine you, imprison you...

Is it--?
...-tor Long.
But you have no choice but to follow orders.
Now, I know.  You have moral objections to what we're doing here, but believe...
Is this stool taken?
Is that why you're here?  To blame...
Well, Lieutenant Vitelli.
Pleasant surprise.
And I certainly can't say it's pleasant.
I checked your release date.  I never liked coincidences.
Closin' down, sir.
All right.  Let's clear the mess and move out.
Nothing has changed, I assure you both. The Army still thinks we got Elvis.  They had a tactical withdrawal.  It's just those two amateurs now.  Do you really want to concede a hundred million dollars to them?

So anyway, he says, 'whyn't you do what the Chinese do?'
No. She happens to think the last one was murdered.
I think I gave it to her.
Do you know him?
Where from?
Of course, but you've got no reason to think he's bungled the case?
No. She's probably scared to death.
Yeah. Do you remember the last time you talked to Mulwray?
I'll look into it as soon as I check out some avocado groves.
With her mother.
Yes... I think I can manage...
That's all taken care of. You see, Mr. Gittes. Either you bring the water to L.A. or you bring L.A. to the water.
I have no idea. How much do you want?
What can I tell you, Kid? You're right. When you're right, you're right, and you're right.
I said okay, Jake.
I've been wanting to meet you.
Thank you...
The apple core club.
You're welcome to try. There he is.
Didn't you call?
How did she...  ...happen to have them?
I don't think about it one way or the other. But if you want, give me a day or two, and I'll get back to you. Now I'd like to go home.
Why do you think Mulwray's body was moved you dimwit? Evelyn Mulwray knocked off her husband in the ocean and thought it would look like more of an accident if she hauled him up to the Oak Pass Reservoir?
What for?
Jake, you're very disturbed. You're crazy. That's her father.
A private investigator?
Well yes.
I don't think so, Mrs. Mulwray. Of course you have my deepest sympathy and if we need anymore information, we'll be in touch.
Yeah. Fine, thank you.
Suppose they did. How does it concern you?
A check?
Yes. As I said, I was very grateful.
I have?
It wasn't much of a lie.
Did you have affairs?
You mean you don't know where you were?
Yes, of course. It was quite a while after. I was just out of grade school when they did that.
Not over me. Why would they have a falling out over me?
Yes. He never forgave him for it.
What dam?
Jasper Lamar Crabb?
What? What is it?
They can't be.
Why?
Why?
Yeah.
You can't always tell what's going on there.
I thought I was keeping someone from being hurt and actually I ended up making sure they were hurt.
Please don't be angry... believe me, it's got nothing to do with you.
You didn't tell me.
You bastard.
The police?
You won't go to the police if I tell you?
Where's the girl?
What the hell is this all about?
To Mexico...
I'm all right.
He's in the dark room.
Yes, Mr. Gittes.
It's on your desk. Say, you hear the one about the guy who goes to the North Pole with Admiral Byrd looking for penguins?
Jesus, that's in Chinatown, ain't it?
Oh yes we have... are you alone, Mr. Gittes?
Oh no.
A Miss Sessions calling.
Of course.
Oh, good.
I don't think so. Be happy to show you.
Just, if you will, confine yourself to the main building. It's nearly bedtime.
Yes...
Yes?
What about the water?
Yeah. Banged up pretty bad.
It's not completely dry.
But...
Yeah.  Do you have any references?
Yeah.
Yes.
Along with Mr. Mulwray.
I don't know. The traffic was pretty loud. I only heard one thing – apple core.
All she needed for that was the phone book!
When I find out who that phony bitch was.
They're all a bunch of phonies.
I don't want Mulvihill.  I want the big boys that are making the payoffs.
Nothing. You got a hell of a way to make a living.
I'm working for his daughter.
You must be thinking of a different daughter.
Why'd she run away?
So I can have these? 
Of course I knew your father. He was tall, thin, pleasant, and had a moustache like mine. Always smiling. He looked like Clark Gable.
But don't you like anything about what you do? 
It tastes wonderful!
Oh yes, father. Now everything's clear.
Elena. My name's Elena.
Yes, nice day.  ...I've got to go now. Bye-bye.
That's nothing to do with it, it's the car that's still being run in...
The army says that, as a war orphan, I don't have to serve in the military, but nothing can be done. It's a bureaucratic error. I have to leave. Day after tomorrow morning. They're sending me to Rome. But they'll discharge me ten days later. Let's go...
Who?
Alfredo, damn him! He cast his spell on you too!
He wasn't crazy. In the beginning I was upset. I think I really hated him. But then, with time, I understood what he said...and your silence too.
No...
So what's that got to do with it?
How are you, Mr. Thatcher?
That's all right, Mr. Bernstein.
I ordered six already this morning! Got a discount!
You're right, Mr. Bernstein.
Well, why don't you, Mr. Bernstein? You know Mr. Leland.
Well, Mr. Bernstein, you were with Mr. Kane from the very beginning -
Not some girl he knew casually and then remembered after fifty years, on his death bed -
He made an awful lot of money.
It didn't end very well, did it?
Yes -
Nothing particular the matter with him, they tell me.  Just - 
Who said anything about brooms?
Certainly not.  So what's that got to do with it?  Mr. Kane, he'll have them changed to his kind of newspapermen in a week.
I'm all right, Mr. Leland.  Only there was some fellows out front that thought they ought to take things up with me.  I learned 'em! Didn't I, officer?
We've got a nice plant here.
He used to work fast - didn't he, Mr. Bernstein?
I made Miss - Miss Alexander send you the note.  She was a little unwilling at first -  but she did it.
Emily -
Emily - you musn't leave me now - you can't do that to me.
You decided what you were going to do, Charles - some time ago.  You can't always have it your own way, regardless of anything else that may have happened.  Come on, Charles.
What's the matter with you?
You are.  You look like you've been making mud pies.
You're no Venus de Milo.
I've got a brush in the closet.  As soon as the mud on your trousers is all dry - you just brush it off.
No.  But you're close.
You're getting farther away all the time.  It's a duck.
I work at Seligman's.
Well, I -
Oh, no, that's all gone.
Half past eleven.
You always said you wanted to live in a palace.
You're in a tent, darling.  You're not at home.  And I can hear you very well if you just talk in a normal tone of voice.
- And left?  Of course they'll hear.  I'm not saying goodbye - except to you - but I never imagined that people wouldn't know.
Get out!  I've got nothing to talk to you about.  If you want to see me, have the Warden write me a letter.
Don't you worry about me.  I'm Charles Foster Kane.  I'm no cheap, crooked politician, trying to save himself from the consequences of his crimes -
Thanks.
You can't.
Your mother won't be going right away, Charles -
I don't know how to run a newspaper, Mr. Thatcher.  I just try everything I can think of.
I think we'll have to send our friend Wheeler a cable, Mr. Bernstein.  Of course, we'll have to make it shorter than his, because he's working on an expense account and we're not.  Let me see -  Mike!
They're all part of your general attack - your senseless attack - on everything and everybody who's got more than ten cents in his pocket. They're -
Yes, sir. 
What're you going to do, Charlie?
It's a good idea for a newspaper.  Four hundred sixy thousand.
Our readers are, anyway, I don't know about the rest of the country.
Yes?
Do you think you're the one who should call him a great man?
Yesterday morning you called the President a traitor.  What do you think that crowd is doing down there?  They think you murdered him.
You've said a lot of things about the President in the last few months.
Charlie!
What lesson?  Not to expose fraud when I see it?  Not to fight for the right of the people to own their own property?  Run it the way I said, Reilly - "This afternoon a great man was assassinated -"
You're not going to like it in Chicago.  They wind comes howling in from the lake.  And there's practically no opera season at all - and the Lord only knows whether they've ever heard of Lobster Newburg -
Yes.
That's the train with all the lights.
Rawlston is my boss.
He knows the first Mrs. Kane socially -  That's the answer we got.
Yes.
I wonder -  You put all this together - the palaces and the paintings and the toys and everything - what would it spell?
Good!
Well, thanks a lot.
Oh!  I thought maybe we could have a drink together?
He married you, didn't he?
It's a trach ring. It's what they install in your throat when throat cancer takes your voice box. This one came out of a sixty-year-old man.
How long have you been a smoker?
The ones in this town, yes! You encourage their growth, their habit. You're the source in this area, and we're going to shut you down for good! For good, cancer-merchant!
Wow, you got thrown out? For Dante?
Can I join in?
Few are. So what makes you think you can maintain a relationship with Dante this time around?
Well, there are, but for some reason they stop working at five-fourteen every night.
Dante. You've got a customer.
Thanks for the vote of confidence.
Yeah, but not seriously. Christ, you're ready to walk down the aisle- I'd say that constitutes something more than just seeing somebody.
If he's so nice, why aren't you going to marry him?
Give me a bit more credit. I think it's time we got back together, you know. I'm more mature, you're more mature, you're finishing college, I'm already in the job market...
Cute. Tell me you wouldn't want to go out again. After all the talking we've been doing.
Yes. A real date. Dinner and a movie.
I'm just kidding.
He went to rent a movie, but he hasn't gotten back yet. Ah, screw it; I'll just lock the store up and leave him a note.
Yeah.
We're sorry, ma'am. We got a little carried away.
I'll assess all I want!
I know. I'm sorry. Let me refund your cigarette money, and we'll call it even.
To the back, above the oil.  How long are you staying?
Are you open?
If you grab a Gatorade, then everybody's going to grab one.
Don't screw with it. It makes us look suspicious.
What do you mean?
That girl was vile to you.
Your mother.
No, no, I'm listening. She's leaving college, and...?
What about Veronica?
All right, Vader's boss...
Right, the Emperor. Now the Emperor is kind of a spiritual figure, yes?
There's more?
And you figured it out?
Not just Imperials, is what you're getting at.
I told him that and he yelled at me.
You know how much money the average jizz-mopper make per hour?
He's the guy in those nudie-booth joints who cleans up after each guy that jerks off.
Liar! Tell me there aren't customers that annoy the piss out of you on a daily basis.
Let's hear it.
All of them.
Shut up!  Yes, I've calmed down, I'm still not happy about it, but I've been able to deal.
Not a fucking word! Slippery shit!
We're not playing in the street.
One ball!! They come all the way here... I close the damn store... for one ball!
Randal, twelve minutes is not a game! Jesus, it's barely a warm-up!
Exactly. They drank it all.
Embolism in her brain. Yesterday.
No, you're not.
Paulsen's Funeral Parlor. The next show is at four.
Wait, wait, wait. Has it occurred to you that I might bereaved as well?
But I love gatherings. Isn't it ironic?
If you go, I go.
Twenty-two; same as us.
Reach what?
So the casket fell over! Big deal!
So they'll put her back in! It's not like it's gonna matter if she breaks something!
Why should I loan you my car?
You work in a video store!
If title dictated my behavior, as a clerk serving the public, I wouldn't be allowed to spit a mouthful of water at that guy. But I did, so my point is that people dictate their own behavior. Hence, even though I'm a clerk in this video store, I choose to go rent videos at Big Choice.  Agreed?
I know I'm your hero.
And this is what you rented?
I swear. I couldn't make this kind of hell up.
No. I'm happy because Caitlin came to see me.
In my absence, try not to sell cigarettes to any newborns.
I might be leaving early to go out with Caitlin, in which case you'll have to close the store tonight.
I was born.
Fuck you.
I can't, all right! Jesus, would you leave me alone? I can't make changes like that in my life. If I could, I would-but I don't have the ability to risk comfortable situations on the big money and the fabulous prizes.
Point is-I'm not the kind of person that disrupts things in order to shit comfortably.
What don't you do?  Randal, sometimes it seems like the only reason you come to work is to make my life miserable.
You wanna grab something to eat tomorrow night... after I get out of here?
I know I can bench more than that!
You remember Alyssa Jones? She hung out with...
I'm her sister.
Caitlin used to talk about him all the time.
They are not.
How much can you bench?
You sell to people that can't stay away from an addiction.
So.
Lasagne.
Maybe.
She's my girlfriend.
So I'm told.
I understand, but can I use it. I'm not that young anymore, so I'm kind of... you know... incontinent.
No, I mean the ones there. Behind the counter.
Yeah. I like the cartoons. They make me laugh. They draw the biggest titties.
I'm only here until twelve, then I'm gone. The boss is coming in.
Hunhh? Nothing.
Nothing! Jesus! I gotta fight with you now?
Who's defensive?  Just... Would you just hug me?! All right? Your boyfriend was accosted by an angry mob, and he needs to be hugged.
Theoretically, people see money on the counter and nobody around, they think they're being watched.
I had to use shoe polish to make that sign. The smell won't come off.
Making a male climax is not all that challenging: insert somewhere close and preferably moist; thrust; repeat.
A girl makes a guy cum, it's standard. A guy makes a girl cum, it's talent.
Something wrong?
It wasn't directed at you. I was making a broad generalization.
It's important to me, Dante. You have so much potential that just goes to waste in this pit. I wish you'd go back to school.
Sylvan made it up. It's a blow job thing.
Sylvan? No; I snowballed him.
I'm serious...
Yeah. How do you think I know he liked...
Please calm down.
Dante...
All right! Shut up a second and I'll tell you! Jesus! I didn't freak like this when you told me how many girls you fucked.
Something like thirty-six.
Yeah, I went down on a few guys...
I'm glad you've calmed down a bit.  Hi, Randal.
...it isn't there. Yes.
I don't want to go back with her...
A word of advice: Sometimes it's best to let those hard to reach chips go.
Yes.  I'm not out of shape.
What?
I've been here since six o'clock this morning. Why?
Scumbag. What are you doing?
Swear.  Olaf, metal!
Wait, there's more.  Olaf: sing... 
I don't know. I can't really tell from here.
Oh, I know. If I had to work here all day, I'd be bloated and out of shape, too.
I like the way you think.
You're gonna be at John K's party?
Don't hold it against him. He just never got Caitlin out of his system. It's not your fault. It's Dante.  I don't know thing one about chicks. Do you want to cry or something? I can leave.
Says who?
Ain't gonna happen, my friend. I'm getting that tape.
Do you still talk to Sylvan?
That's cool. Well-you two lovebirds take it easy, all right?
How yo doin', Gabe!
That woulda been cool.
Nothing, just tourist souvenirs.
They're about two hundred yards from the top of the tower, right where that ledge comes out, Gabe.
Hal will have my head for this.
I admit, I can be bought.
I copy.
Where's the radio?
So...what are you, blind, son? This is a banana eating a monkey, nature in reverse.
Rescue One -- have located helpless climber, please prepare <u>idiot line</u> for transport, over.
When we get this group down, I'm gone.
And you weren't looking into her eyes when she fell.  Now drop it!
If you want, do it.  I don't care.
My pleasure.
Near Freedom Falls.  She went for help.
Yeah, we were caught in a storm. I went up there an innocent climber...
I don't think you do.
Why are you yelling?
I can't.  Not here.  If you want, I'd like you to come with me...somewhere else.
If it's alright, I'm gonna pick up the rest of my gear.
I haven't climbed in months--you lose the feel.
You know me, I'm a night person.
I'm glad you find humor in this.  Do you know what people would do for that?
Neither can I.  What do you think they're doing now?
Call me sentimental.
Only kidding...<u>actually</u> I attacked you.
Breathtaking.
For the record, whenever you hear me sliding out of control, I'm never alright.  When I secure the line, come on up.
Jess, c'mon...
Don't let me fall!
I'm going to wrap it around your throat!
Forget it!  I refuse!
Ryan, get a rope, I want the man on a leash, too.
Jessie, I reached the top of the Tower.  So far, no sign of anyone.  Looks like a phoney call. Over.
When he finds the money, you're as dead as me.
Qualen, go fuck yourself.  The game's over--you lost.
Climb, Gabe, climb!
On my way.  The cases are hooked up and ready.
The monitor! I never ask twice.
There, what's that place?
Kill him when he gets down.
What about it?
We're down to a few hours before the whole world shows up here.  Where's the next one?
Hey, you dealt us this hand, we're playing it all the way. Move.
I don't give a shit, Qualen!  I had to be insane to ever tie up with a low-life, piece of shit like you.  They beat us.  A couple of fuckin' hick mountain boys beat the man no law agency ever could.
Richard Travers.
We've got a full crew, but we can squeeze one more, right.
You're the boss.  Let's head out to the tarmac.  Matheson, have you been totally briefed?
Watch that... Do watch that, O Dim, if to continue to be on live thou dost wish.
A nozh scrap any time you say. Dim weakens.
Welly, welly, welly, welly, welly, welly, well. To what do I owe the extreme pleasure of this surprising visit? Georgie rises.
I just don't get this all. It was them that went for me, brothers. You're not on their side and can't be. You can't be Dim. It was someone we fillied with back in the old days... Trying to get his own malenky bit of revenge after all this time. You remember, Dim?
The police... The horrible ghastly Police. They beat me up, sir. The Police beat me up, sir. Mr. Alexander stares at him. It becomes apparent he is insane.
Good evening.
Of course. Food alright?
Phoned some friends, sir?
Who are they, sir?
I'm frightfully sorry. There is a telephone in the Public House about a mile down the road. I suggest you use that.
Well, shall we get down to it?
Bit of pain in the gulliver, Mum. Leave us be and I'll try to sleep it off... then I'll be as right as dodgers for this after.
Alex.
I've been doing nothing I shouldn't, sir. The millicents have nothing on me, brother, sir, I mean. Deltoid pulls Alex down on the bed.
Snuff it, sir... um... death, I mean, missus... Er... I just want to die peacefully like with no... pain.
Um... oh no, sir, not exactly, I still feel very miserable, very much down in spirits.
Appy polly loggies. I had something of a pain in the gulliver so had to sleep. I was not awakened when I gave orders for awakening.
Brother, you think and talk sometimes like a little child. Tonight we pull a mansize crast.
Let's hope you make the most of it, my boy.
Thank you very much. Thank you my dear. Girl bows and exits to loud applause.
Well, how are you then?
Well - I'm back.
Sorry, brother. I didn't mean any offence.
... because I don't like you horrible type, do I, and if you want to start something... if you want to start... go on... well, you just start. Please do. Alex retching.
You're gonna be sick are you?
Murder, sir.
No, sir.
Shut your bleedin' hole!!!
Good. In a few minutes, you'll meeting Dr. Brodsky and we'll begin your treatment. You're a very lucky boy to have been chosen.
You mean like going to the pictures?
Well, that's good. I like to viddy the old films now and again.
You mean, I have to viddy two sessions in one day?
Righty, right. The doctor reads aloud the dialogue printed in the cartoon balloon - a peacock.
I'm sure it won't be long now.
Let me be sick... I want to get up. Get me something to be sick in... Stop the film... Please stop it... I can't stand it any more. Stop it please... please.
Yes!!!
Oh, thankyou, your honour. The Tramp takes a second look at Alex.
Fine, my boy, fine, fine.
Amen. They cross themselves.
Prison custody?
Well, like he says, it's mostly odd things he does, helping like... here and there, as it might be.
We've only just read about it in the morning papers.
I agree, sir. What we need are larger prisons. More money.
No.  I got lucky with the lights.
Different instrument altogether.  You know, if you'd only listened to me, we'd be bogged down in traffic right now, and you could have made yourself an extra five bucks.
Why'd you do that?  Don't tell me you're a gentleman, Max. I thought chivalry was dead as a necessary consequence of gender politics...
No?  How many cabbies get you into an argument to save you money?
This?  Temporary.  To pay the bills and save. I got plans...
Yes, you could.  I think you need it more than I do.  It'll help.  I promise.
Sure thing.
It doesn't matter!  Just get out of the goddamn building...
No, no, <u>wait</u>...
Save me the grief.  Step out of the car, sir, and open the trunk.
Most vividly.  "St. Louis Blues," "Potato Head Blues," "Sleepy Time Down South..."  ...then Pops laid some "Cornet Chop Suey" on me, and left me in the dust like a whipped dog.
The crowd was most kind.  I was born in 1945, but my life began the night of July 22, 1964.  That was the moment of my conception.  Right here in this very room.
Of course.
Can't say that I do.
Wouldn't dream of it.
Elvis?
Detective Sergeant Phil Heller.
No harm done, ma'am.
What's your name?
You couldn't pick up a phone?  I'm lying here, wondering if something horrible happened...
Yesss, you are.  He's artistic.
I was just tryin' to...to...
Max!  Dammit!  <u>Answer!</u>
<u>So?</u> Aside from I hate talking to cops, they tell me you crashed the shit out of it.
...everything is not about me, don't make me the villain here.  That asshole was out of line, and you goddamn well know it...
You share it with over three million people every day.  You know that's the population of New Zealand?  What's Manhattan, thirteen miles long? That's a lot of misery crammed into thirteen miles.  Read about this one guy.  Gets on the subway and dies.  Six hours he's riding around before anybody notices. Think about that.  Here's this corpse doing laps around Manhattan courtesy of the New York transit system, people getting on and off, sitting next to him, and still nobody catches on. Three million.  That's too damn many people.
Yeah.  I share it with the dayshift guy.
It's not that kind of job.
Twelve years.  But I'm working on other stuff...
You always stutter?
I'm cool.
...and you promise you'll never tell anybody about this, right?  Get in the fucking car.
I told you we had other stops to make tonight.
Yeah, like that...  But, anyway, nobody gets out of this alive.  Even if we quit smoking and cut out red meat.  Everybody dies.
Then don't let me get cornered, Max. You don't have the trunk space.
It was an accident.  I'm not liable.
Tell him next time he pulls any shit, you're gonna kick his fat ass.
That what we're doing?  Flowing?
I'm not catching a melody.
No.
Fuck!  Nothing's ever goddamn good enough!  It's always been that way.
What happened?
It's not bullshit.
Some living.
You're full of shit.
Then what are you?
Slow down.
But you know what?  Nothing matters, anyway.  We are insignificant out here in the big nowhere, say the badass sociopath in my backseat.  Right? Yeah.  That's one thing I've got to thank you for, bro.  And I never saw it that way...
Was your seatbelt fastened, honey?
Guy came in with a gunshot wound, but he died of a heart attack.  Go figure.
Who?
Any special reason?
Excuse me?
Sorry, Flip.  Got sidetracked.
Shut the hell up.
Come on!  Six major earthquakes in the last three years?  The space shuttle in orbit for every one of them?
Do you still ride?
No.
For what?
Don't tell me you're naked back there.
You mean I should speed up and try and lose them?
That's how a man would do it.  I'm not a man.
Oh, well, maybe to the untrained eye.  Hmm... Ahh...  Ooooo...
I have no idea.
I'm not sure.  I think I figured something out.  It must've been in my newsletter.
You're certifiable.
Um, coffee.  If that's okay?
Never heard of him.
Uh huh.
Never, but I've been practicing.
What van?
Where'd you get your subscribers?
They're dead.  Four out of five anyhow.  All in the last 24 hours. One car accident, two heart attacks and a stroke.
There are all kinds of groups, all kinds of initials.  But they're all part of two warring factions. One:  families that have held wealth for centuries. They want one thing.  Stability. Group Two:  the boat rockers. Eisenhower's military industrial complex.  They want instability. It's a trillion dollar a year business.  When there isn't a hot war, they make a cold one.
His obituary was in every paper. But not one of them said he was murdered.
Nobody dies in Newport.  They couldn't even kill Sunny von Bulow there.  Harriman drowned, but it wasn't in Newport.
A water main broke.
What?
Those are song lyrics, Jerry.
Jerry, I --
Thanks.
Not today.
Where are we going, Jerry?
Come on.
To Jonas.  I didn't know that at the time.  Didn't know who he was.  But I knew inside, whoever he was, he'd send someone else.  So I started watching your father.  I wanted to keep him safe.
Jerry...?  <u>Jerry</u>.
It's up.  Love gives you wings. You can fly away from here.
I can't promise you anything.
That's great.  Good for you.
I'm not sure what you mean.
It seemed like a possibility. What about your intentions?  Are they honorable?
I don't know...
We're very specialized.
Ask what you can do for your country.  That kind of thing.
Terminal?
If I had any idea what to charge you with or how to prove it, I'd arrest you right here.
Yes, that's right.
You do recognize it then?
Walters had nothing to do with your father's murder.
I want this box rigged with a beacon!
Look, you're a nice guy, but I'm not really dating right now.
I don't know if you're the best lawyer I've got or a high school sophomore.
We don't know who Jonas is.  We don't know who it is we're cooperating with.
-- Understood.
You don't understand --
I was just thinking that.
It's his show for now.  Look, you want to get some dinner?  Inter- Agency cooperation and all?
Your call.  Have a good night.
You think we have time to fool around like this?  Come on.
I'm not sure.  We have no launch protocol; the entry of the passenger is supposed to initiate activation.
Pull the plug.  Get her out of there.
Yes, sir.
Okay, fine, they've got the primes -- but if you're right about there being another more significant transmission still to come --
I'm willing to take that risk.
You can't just pull the plug, David.
Meaning...
David --
If it's attention you want I'd say you've got it.  Just one thing:  Why Vega? Everyone's looked at Vega for years with no results, and now, yesterday, they start broadcasting primes. Why?
With me.
I'm going to convert Mr. Science-is- the-root-of-all-evil?  This is absurd, David.  We have work to do here, I don't have time to play babysitter to the God Squad.
Are you threatening me?
We've cracked it.  Lunacharsky found it.
As of three o'clock this afternoon. I submitted my resignation.
This... seemed best.
Good luck, David.
It could be anything.  The first volume of some Encyclopedia Galactica...
I don't know.  Maybe there is a fourth layer in there somewhere, but if there is, I sure as hell can't find it.
Kent, Kent for Chrissakes.  You must be Eleanor.
This is how you see the sky?
It's a civilian facility.
You want to classify prime numbers?
If at some later date the message proves harmless, we can discuss sharing it with the rest of the world, but until then --
-- but I don't believe it to be the truth.
I can't move any smaller.
Mmm, that's a good one.  Maybe his echo...  Okay, no more stalling.
That's a beauty, Captain.  Now get some sleep.
I'm sorry I couldn't be there for you, sweetheart.
We thought this might make things a little easier.
Originally just another species like yourselves.  Well, not like you at all actually, but...
Many others.
We don't know.  Whoever they were, they were gone long before we ever got here.
The librarian... or the library...?
You always have been.  We're all descendants of the same stars, Ellie.  All made of the same primordial atoms.
Now... you go home.
But -- other people from our planet should see what I've seen -- they should witness this for themselves.
Once upon a time I was a hell of an engineer.  Please, sit, Doctor.  I have guests so rarely, it's important to me they feel welcome in my home.  Did you know this was once Yeltsin's flying dascha?  That dent is where he threw a bottle of vodka at the pilot.  At least that's what the people who sold me the plane said...
The infamous, unfashionable bluntness.  You're here so we can do business. I want to make a deal.
The powers that be have been quite busy lately, falling over each other to position themselves for the game of the century, if not the millennium.  Perhaps you've noticed.  Perhaps I could help deal you back in.
Oh, maybe not out -- but definitely looking for you coat.  I understand you've had some difficulty locating the -- what are you calling it?  The 'primer' that will make decryption possible...  I've found it.
That's my girl...  Lights.
A page-break signal.  A period.
Wouldn't you if you saw Hitler on TV?  Come; I want to show you something.
Perhaps.  But on the off-chance that it is a 'doomsday device' of some kind, I plan to be very far away from your lovely Texas when it is activated.
I think it is your naivete I like best about you, Eleanor.  Oh, there'll be a worldwide protest, but we all knew it from the very beginning.  You Americans discovered the signal, you led the decryption effort.  The machine is being built on your home soil... Of course the passenger will be an American, chosen by Americans.  Anyway, it is what the whole world wants, no?  This is the big show. The sort you put on better than anyone.  It's good marketing.  It's good casting.  It's the American way.
Keep it down, okay?  Drumlin thinks I'm enough of a flake as it is.  Look -- everyone here has their little fetishes.  Caven goes to topless bars, Vernon's got his carnivorous plants... mine just happens to be extraterrestrial intelligence.
They can't.  I think it's against human nature to admit to that level of... insignificance; to not see yourself as basically the center of the universe.
And?
How close are you to getting this funding put together?
-- I'm moving to Washington.
I'm going on staff at the N.S.F.  To work for Drumlin.
You too.
Like it or not.
I'd say logic more than faith.  The odds were on my side.
Only a tiny bit.  Even the most devout believer is allowed a little doubt.
You may not believe this... but there's a part of me that wants more than anything to believe in your God.  To believe that we're all here for a purpose, that all this... means something.  But it's because that part of me wants it so badly that I'm so stubborn about making sure it isn't just self-delusion. Of course I want to know God if there is one... but it has to be real.  Unless I have proof how can I be sure?
I don't consider you the enemy, Ellie.  I'm not 'out to get' technology.  I only ask the question:  Does it have to have all the answers?  I look out there and I see so much emptiness... People are so starved for meaning, and it's something they just don't seem to be getting from science.
I remember.  You were indelicate, indiscreet and entirely less than tactful... Sound like anyone you know?
Thank you.
I can't do this --
And yet that's always how I seem to end up, isn't it?  If you really do love me, Palmer, you'll leave.  Now.  Please.
I do.
Maybe what you experienced can't be reduced to images on a videotape. Maybe they still plan to grant your request, only in their own way, in their own time... Or maybe it's just like you said:  ultimately their motives may be as incomprehensible as their technology.
In other words.
Meaning...
Git movin', I said.
It wasn't his fault. Nobody said anything about seats. We --
I've got this weak heart. Too much drinking, I guess. As soon as they find out about it, they'll probably send me someplace else.
I got two years.
We allus thought you was strong enough to carry it. Was we wrong?
Well, I don't know, I just wash my hands of it, I guess I just got to love you and let go.
Here, Mom.
She took off with that convertible feller...
Yeah.
Gotta go, Arletta.
Sure he's got kings but you still gotta call him.
Yeah. Did you have them both at once or --
I don't know, Boss.
She's on to him. You shoulda waited fer me to git her out -- loose like she is, he kin run her crazy.
Maliciously destroyin' municipal property while under the influence. What was that?
Well, we ain't never had one of them. Where'd you think that was gonna get you?
Fasten your flap! All you Newmeats gonna have to shape up fast and hard on this gang. We got rules here an' in order to learn them, you gotta keep your ears open and your mouths shut.
Borrowin'.
Wouldn't surprise me none.  Wicker Man says you got a hundred- twenny and some change in the Captain's safe and you got your five dollars pocket money... That'll buy you a whole fistfull of cards. You in or out?
I got eyes, don't I? How my not gonna see something like that?
He's eatin' steak and corn with butter and green beans and...
It'd go to your coconut head. You'd start getting ideas. Maybe even pass right out.
Long enough to see redhots come and redhots go.
Your Lucille? Man, you better put them glasses back on and take a look at yourself.
Stop beatin', man. You ain't doin' nobody no good.
That's it. That's the end.
We got it locked in the sock.
Like an elephant.
Oh, that's mah darlin' Luke. Grins like a baby and bites like a 'gator.
Why sure, Luke. I mean I didn't talk to them about that. But why not? They're reasonable, Luke. Hell, we only been gone a coupla hours.
One rule! No throwing up. He throws up, you forfeit everything.
Come on, boy, come on, darlin'. You kin do her. Just let that ol' belly sag and enjoy itself. Stay loose, buddy. Eight more, between you and everlasting glory. Little ol' eggs, pigeon eggs, that's all, fish eggs practically.
Dear Boys. Playing it cool. Wish you were here. Love, Cool Hand Luke.
Bears gonna be walkin' the road today.
Call.
Kick a buck.
Well, how far didya get?
Hell, no. I ain't goin' down in the ditch.
You can't expect him to learn everything the first day. Hopefully it's taught him a very valuable lesson.
This is a big day for the guards. They get to remind us who's boss.
None of your fucking business.
Only kidding!
A little homeopathic cure for the willies.
Would you please get your hands off my face, Tallulah?  What happened to the newspaper?
A little heavy breathing is what most of us yearn for.  <u>Forget</u> it.
'Lying.  He was lying.'  I asked you what you thought, not what he did.
What pattern was that?
When was that?
What Friday?
I'm trying to tell you.  It's on the lady's pillow...
He told you she was loaded, any- thing you could steal you could keep, Conrad?  You bought yourself a return ticket to Quentin, breaking and entering.
That Klutz.  They send him back here, I'll kick his ass good.
Who was the man in the basement?
Where are you, Peter?
I don't care -- she's a cop.  That's the important thing.  Cop-ness, not sex-ness.  It won't be perfect, but it'll be good.
You know where.
Don't talk to me about courage.  I know death, what it's like to kill. You're not a killer -- you watched Daryll Lee kill that cop and you didn't make a peep, because you were paralyzed with fear.  You chocked.  I know something <u>else</u> about you.
Inspector Halloran, Homicide.  I'm in charge here.
Will you go.  Andy, make them go.
Nothing.
How did you know they were stockings?
Nobody knows you have anything to do with this case; nothing has been on TV or the news... Why would he want to get in <u>your</u> computer?
He's going home.  He slept over because I was a little anxious...
Hello, Ruben...  So that's that...
That's exactly... I could have taken that same picture, this morning.
Who's going to catch him?  You?  And if you do, there'll be another one.  And one after that.
One of those goddamned car alarms. What's going...
Look in the crowd.  He liked to hang around and watch the cops at work...
Look.  There's the order:  you wrote it:  DeSalvo, Bianchi & Buono, Berkowitz and Dahmer.  It's going to be Dahmer next.  Which means he'll kill a man.
I've got to go.  I've <u>got</u> to go.
W-We had a fight.  I called him... called him a name...
Shhh.  It's okay.  Just breathe. I'll fix it...
Go and look for a note.
What else?
She is a writer, writing best selling books about serial killing. Giving lectures she's well-paid for.  Her interests are not the interests of law enforcement.
We've put a tap on Dr. Hudson's phone.  I know you won't mention it.
Maybe it's something you did in this life, Nikko...
Oh, I know.
Doped up kids all over town.  Park was full of them last night.  Very easy pickin'.  Goetz's type.
Christ.  I didn't lock the fucking drawer!  You spend twenty years thinking some perp's gonna whack you... you'll crash your car... but what happens is, you fuck yourself...  You can't imagine how many times I saw you two... your head together, I wish him dead.  Every time... Want to hear something weird?  I feel like I'd give my life to bring him back.
Just horseshit luck.
You know, M.J., when I watch you shoot, I realize I've got a little problem with my stance... could you just move over here and critique my legs?
You're right.  I can't stand that bastard.  Sorry.  This is something new.  Not the same guy, that's for sure.
Don't try to lie, Ruben.  You don't have the face for it.  I need you to help interrogate the burglar in Hudson's place...
Am I in charge of this thing?  Or not.
Anybody in this department ever worked a serial killer case?  She's the expert.  I need help.
That's always your privilege, sir.
Yessir.
Who've I got to beat up except the messenger?  Does this give us anything to go on?
I know.  Get out here.
What?  I talk like a cop, this is the way I talk.  I can't believe this guy.  Saks.  He's a Deputy Assistant Director of the F.B.I. "Let me help you!"
"Spokes<u>person</u>."
No, she can come in tomorrow... gonna want to know a lot of things...
...confirm this third murder adds up to a pattern?  Do we have a serial killer on the loose in the city?
She left you, Nikko.  She's not your responsibility.  She takes very good care of herself.  If she wants to romance the kid, it ain't your business.  Your business is to snap out of it.
Don't give me six years!  You never divorced Patty, did you?  So what'd you expect from M.J.?
What's going down with the sting in Chinatown?  That gonna be off your plate in a week or what?
I've been thinking about that, about you and Karen.
Thank you.
James.
Were you badly hurt? I think we saw each other at the hospital.  I don't want the car. In fact, I was appalled to find that I have to pay a small fee to have it scrapped.
That's Vaughan. He talked to you at the hospital.
When I first met Vaughan, he was a specialist in international computerized traffic systems. I don't know what he is now.
I saw the blood. It looks like motor oil.
Serious. But you'll have to take your new friend, the female crash-test dummy. She dropped it off for you.
Hard to say.
No, thanks. I'll go with Vaughan.
I live in my car. This is my workshop.
Is that why you drive this car? I take it that you see Kennedy's assassination as a special kind of car-crash?
A crude sci-fi concept that floats on the surface and doesn't threaten anybody. I use it to test the resilience of my potential partners in psychopathology.
I apologize for the inconvenience, but I must ask you some...
I think in the spirit of group therapy, it's beneficial for each of us to open ourselves up to the others.
We'll see about adjusting the dosage if that doesn't clear in the next  How are other things going?
Well, Letty, this does present a liability issue for the hospital.
All I want you to do is think about what's best for you. Really think about it.
Have you been in contact with the principal about your job?
Then, you should call.
Please, Letty.
But everything's OK?
Thanks so much for planning it, Letty. Jake's really looking forward to it.
Mom and I fought for 20 minutes over whether we should go with ecru invitations or brilliant white.
Ecru.
That's thanks to all your help.
You don't have to make any decisions tonight.
I'll be running it three days a week, and...
Wow.   Congratulations.
No, not yet. But you know Paul. He's sure to get it.
Mom, look, if I want to dump Paul, I'll dump him. If I want to screw Michael or live with him or marry him, then I'll do that.
There's a spider in my room.
Lie?
It's OK. It's not a pass-fail kind of thing.
Sometimes my food, and my clothes, and my underwear.
Is this really important? Because I don't think it's a problem.
I'm not the one who's masquerading as a doctor. I'm not the one who's, who's...
Anything interesting.
Very romantic setting.
So are you engaged, or what?
And I'm not covering for you when you sneak out to call Dominos.
The lady knows this is a dandelion.
I'd like to drink a bottle of red wine with you and then make love to you and spend the whole night together. And we'd get up in the morning and spend hours lounging around and reading the paper.
I saw Paul leaving.    Did you do the dirty deed?
So, it's over?
I better make a list.
Do you like it?
Out? Are you kidding?     I've got all the fixings here.
It's sex time.
Promise.  As long as we have steak.
You got wine. That's great.
You go ahead and relax. I'll cook.
Are you OK?
No, that's Aunt Connie. Lily is the one who looks like a hooker.
It wasn't exactly a lie.
Why'd you tell?
Michael, take it easy.
I love you too, Letty.     I love you, too.
That's the best idea I've heard in a long time.
It's not another one. It's my sister.  Aren't you happy for her?
Good going. I knew you could do it.
Huntley told me today that if I come through on the Benton deposition, they may consider me for senior associate.
That's a big question.
Something you did?
So, I've been thinking a lot...
You don't have to say anything else. I've known for a while that this was coming.
It's, it's really nice, Paul.
No, no.
I've met someone else.
He's a patient here.
I love him.
I start on Monday.
I think I've heard this speech before.
Sure, I understand.
I'm glad you're doing well.
What does that mean?
Office work?
I'll float you.
If you ever want to get those tapes, meet me in one hour at Grant Park near the statue.
You killed her!
A pass? How you gonna give me a pass? A witness can put me at the crime scene.
They don't have a murder weapon?
Hey, you're not exactly the most trustworthy guy in the world. I took a shot. It didn't work. Did you bring the tapes?
What?
It's Daniel.
I'm good.   Really.
Supernumerary. It means better than expected.
Yes.
Some cash. Jewelry. The other stuff I can replace, but there's a cardboard box... photos of my mother. They're the only ones I have of her.
Not such a good friend.   May I reach in my pocket?
If you think because you're a women this can't go hard on you, think again.
Laurant and Vincent were in business with Zammito.
Black market art. Zammito got to a few key security guards at the Metropolitan Museum. The Bastaldi's supplied the artists to make copies of famous works. They'd switch the paintings, send the originals to Paris and the Bastaldi's would sell them to private collectors.
She probably hid it at her place.    The six of us could find it in --
I'm not any closer than you are.
You want Zero to kill him?
And be careful when you get near the top. Zero has a very long one.
We all agreed to it. You had no way of knowing Bastaldi was setting us up.
Good idea.
All you are is a professional ass-kisser.
Has to be.
You haven't answered my question.
I ain't bullshittin'. I can get guns. I can get any kind of gun you want. But they ain't gonna help your sorry ass. You ain't been in town one day and already you got two of the toughest people in Chicago looking for you. How is that possible?
Yeah, I'd be from Belgium too if I was you. You know Zammito just put his own brother in the hospital? Broke his arm cause he was late on a debt. I mention this to illustrate the kind of people who are lookin' for you.
How much?
It's me.
Fine.     Ten o'clock.
-- Don't think. Okay?        You're not good at it.
French guys?    You mean like from France?
Okay boss.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Yeah and if you turned it around it would say to go right.
You can use my car.
This wasn't the deal! The deal was to steal a necklace, not get in the middle of a Mafia war.
Hey, it's not your picture on the TV, it's mine. So, try to be cool.
She took everything!    Didn't even leave us cab fare.
Oh, Marcel! I thought you were somebody else. If I knew it was you I would have never run.
Yeah, I can see that.
Okay.   You can be Elvis.
Mr. Taylor?
God, I want to go home.
He's over at St. James. They had to put two pins in his arm.
The hell it is.
Uh huh.
How?
I know where she went.
What?
Julien, what you're doing right now is a very normal psychological reaction to stress. You're projecting your anger onto us.
I'm more of a whiskey drinker myself.
What does arresting us get them?
No, I like the bag. It would be good for the job tonight.
The lucky ones.
It's three in the morning.    Not much else to do.
Stick around and find out.
That's why we're only breaking one arm.
A little?
You gonna forget about the money I owe you?
I don't know. Sell it. It's gotta be worth something. Someone gave it to me. C'mon Frankie, I'm trying to make good here.
I'll get you the papers tomorrow.
I do as I please.
What's it to you?
Let's go!
Shut up!
I studied the diagrams.  But you hid the details!
Go to bed then.  Miss has grown up, and is getting married soon.  God knows what the future will bring.
The handle is heavy.  And the blade is no ordinary metal.  Still, the sword is the lightest of weapons. You're just not used to handling it.
My friend Li Mu Bai.  He's given it to Sir Te as a gift.
Fighters have rules too: friendship, trust, integrity... Without rules, we wouldn't survive for long.
Writers wouldn't sell many books if they told how it really is.
I'm just borrowing some clean clothes.  I'm not staying.
I was just passing by and wondered how you were.
What I've always wanted, to teach you.
Then you have no use for the sword.
All right.  Hurry.  I will hold on as long as I can.
So you're still that little boy looking for shooting stars.
It has.  How's business?
I am.  He has always been our greatest protector.
Too many men have died at its edge. It only looks pure because blood washes so easily from its blade.
I knew she would intrigue you.
But Wudan does not accept women.
It's not our affair.  Even if Wudan accepts her, her husband might object.
My life is departing.  I've only one breath left.
Li Mu Bai giving up his sword and his warrior days... maybe he's trying to tell you something?
Then someone's trying to set him up. We should inform Li Mu Bai.
Who ever made that.
I'm buying.
Annie, I need a file.
I knew that.
Leave here.  Don't do this.  I don't want you here.
You're bleeding, man.  You can't make it.
Out.  Now.  I gotta work.
No name.  You sure ask a lot of questions.
I have to go.
I think he's yours, now.
She's still dead.
Last Halloween, eh?  Yeah...  Yeah, I remember.  I fucked her too, I think.
Take the dope, too.
You don't even remember...
You're too late.  There was a guy outside - on the stairs - you really need to talk to.  But he turned to dust and blew away.  I don't have any power for you to take.
Magic.
Interested?  Follow the crow.
Shelly?
Shut up.
18k.  Crap.
Yeah, I know, fatso.  Do us all a favor.  Make Top Dollar smile.
Like some sort of zombie on a revenge trip.
Kill a dead guy?
Bad news.  Alot of action on the streets tonight, and nobody bothered to clear it with me.  Tin- Tin got himself whacked.
You didn't show it to anybody?
Junior.
That's a first. Most people praised me for it.
Take yourself. You've slept with several women. Are you happier because of it?
Several times. I'm not as dumb as I act, you know. When Howard Roark makes love to Dominique Francon... most romantic scene in all of literature.
That's a matter of opinion.
Why don't you come join me for a swim and we'll discuss it.
About what you said today in the stable. I'm not a happy person.
It's my house.
Give it up.
Don't you believe in love at first sight?
What?
Well, I was just calling to see how you're doing.
Yeah, it's pretty relevant considering my situation.
Oh please.
You must take me for a real idiot.
You're going to tell me that you had a good time with the old lady.
I can't win with you.
I have feelings for you.
Get off me.
Yeah, me neither.
You don't even know me. The fact of the matter is there is some one I love. She's smarter, prettier... you don't even compare to her. The only reason I am here is because she wants us to be exclusive.
Thank you, Annette. Chance Hill has been with my family for over sixty years. Does your family do much riding?
Doesn't ring a bell.
- none taken -
Let's just say Greg likes tackling tight ends on and off the field.
I shit you not. McConnell used to sneak in my dorm room drunk every month. We'd go at it for a while, then as soon as he'd cum, he starts freaking out. You know -  "What are you doing, man? I'm not a fag. I'll kick your ass if you say anything."  It's like, for Christsakes Greg, you're gay, deal with it. The only reason why I let him continue with his charade is because he's got a mouth like a Hoover.
Hmmm. I do believe Bravo is showing Spartacus on television tonight.
Alright, I believe you. Stop crying. Your secret's safe with me.
Don't you raise your voice at me. Go to your room, now.
I was thanking her. Vietnamese is such a beautiful language.
Thanks.  Nice meeting you.
What a loser she must be.  Anyhow, Court's invited me to the Hamptons for Labor Day Weekend.
Eww. No. That's gross.
It was nothing.
No.
I don't know.
You'd do that for me?
No.
Well did you like it?
I am?
You think he'll like it?
Mmmm, you're right. Those clothes don't do you justice. Why don't you take them off.
Good night Cecile.
I know.
Don't be insecure, Doc. You're a big help.
You do?
What, nervous I'm going to win?
Honey, is something wrong?
Jesus!
Who is this?
I told you I don't know.
Alright. She's staying with some friends of her parents. The O'Sheas. She caught the train twenty minutes ago into Grand Central.
It's Kathryn.
Racist piece of shit.
Outstanding.
It just so happens we're not in Kansas anymore. Our little angel's father has accepted the new headmaster position at Oakwood. She's staying with my aunt up in Connecticut while Daddy sells his house. Can you imagine what this would do for my reputation? Screwing the new headmaster's virginal daughter before school starts? It will be my greatest victory.
Care to make a wager on that?
Oh well, duty calls. Time to add another chapter to my work of art.
Shhh.
Call Cecile up and get her to come over. I'll bust that cherry in a heartbeat.
Ooo, I'm sure Mrs. Caldwell will love that.
What's your plan of attack?
Cecile.
What is that? Oh my God, it's your conscience.
Take a look for yourself.
I have a flair for drama.
That's beautiful.
It's Cecile.
Well... you promise you won't say anything to her. We've developed a friendship and...
You will be discreet about this?
Oh don't give me any of that racist crap. My husband and I gave money to Colin Powell.
I've already told you, she's not home.
Fine. Could you please see that she gets this.
We played backgammon?
Excuse me?
What are you talking about?
Hello. I just met Amy and she pointed out where you live.
But you don't keep a cat, do you?
Yes,  She's a little odd, I understand.
What do you mean?
I wasn't saying anything. I was singing.
The song I was trying to hum. The song my friend, taught me.
Yes, darling.
Oh, lots of times.
At the old house with the voice.
Are they nice?
Irena.
She's not Irena's child -- there's nothing of Irena in her. She's my child.
Times have changed.
No kids yet.  Something's gone wrong. Maybe I ought to call somebody.
I think I should.  3000W?
But they must have.  Amy and I made them out together.  You mailed them, didn't you, Edward?
Amy picked it off the top of that stack. Perhaps you'd better go through the whole bunch. There may be others of Irena in there.
Your birthday, Amy --  as she goes) -- and I have something for you in my locker. A present.
Are you coming to see us. Miss Callahan?
I live right here.
Yes, daddy.
I did.  I came to an old dark house, and a voice called to me -- a lovely, sweet voice ---
It's true.
Yes, Amy?
Where, Amy? Where do you see her?
I don't know yet.
I'm your friend.
No. This must be a friendship that only we shall have... you and I... Amy and her friend.
This is more fun than just pretend.
Yes, winter's coming.  I don't like the winter,
Oh, thank you, Amy.
A merry Christmas to you, Amy.
It is wildness and freedom. No one can touch it.
Don't cry, Amy.
Maybe, if it's a real mourning ring like we have in Jamaica. All you got to do is turn it on your finger, close your eyes, and make a wish.
Will you come soon?
But Mrs. Farren just started to tell me a story. Please.
But she's such a nice lady.
It's a hard winter. All the animals are bold as brass, coming down into the streets for food. You'll see a lot of deer this winter.
But I saw what it was. It's the little deer.
Why is it just lying there? Why doesn't it get up?
Good.
A Christmas present. It's been so long since I've had a Christmas present.
Yes, yes -
I can't do it! I can't do it!
Gray. They were a lovely, lovely gray.
It was pale...a shadowed gold.
I-shan't see her. No, Barbara, no.
I'll not see her, Barbara. I promise.
Good night...Barbara...
Come away, Amy.
Yes, everything's all right, Edward.
I like to see her happy.
Something to do with a butterfly-- they were quarreling about it.
She needed, a companion, so out of her own hunger she created one. In her mind her friend was in the garden. In her mind her friend never leaves her. Right this very minute I'm sure she's upstairs sobbing out her grief to a friend who exists only in her mind.
Can we get some service here?
Yeah yeah I know. Smoking kills. I'll quit someday. Doesn't it seem like all the cool people smoke?
Good. Except for PMS.
It's hard to describe. I get really bloated and irritable and emotional and depressed and...
I get crazy dreams and I black out.
Does she have PMS?
No, I'm not a lesbian. Geez mom.
Maybe he's just shy.
Frida, I don't mean this as a criticism, but you might not want to talk about PMS around men.
I don't know.
Frida, grab that red one.
What a bitch. You should see a doctor. That can be dangerous. George bit me once and I had to go to the emergency room.
I kind of asked him to. We were, you know... he got a little carried away...
Holy shit, I'm a freak.
Oh, my glasses! Maybe my eyes got stronger from not wearing them.
I ate a burger in the afternoon and a steak and a half with Gregory.
And my bra finally fits again.
My vision got worse again.
No, Mark wears boxers. They must have been in the dryer already.
I'm sorry. I didn't want you to think I was still a doormat.
Hmmm. Sounds suspicious.
It is so hot in here.
I still thought it was a purse.
No you don't, believe me.
And he was missing an arm.
Tell them you'll meet them outside.
You'll get through this. You were fine for over three weeks.
Remember what Madame Sconce said. If you love him he'll be fine.
About Mark? Carlton?
Oh, a D-Girl. You know... I have a really great idea for a screenplay.
Starving.
Well, whattdaya think?
Hey, how about a little nightcap?
I didn't have to pee then.
Oh my god, I'm sorry!
Yeah right... You better go.
This really isn't a good time.
My bra is my biggest supporter.
Okay, if you think of anything else, please give us a call.
Are you following me?
That's my ex. He's an asshole. In case you couldn't tell. I think he's been following me.
I'm trying to stay away from caffeine.
Oh my god, by wolves?
Me neither. That's why I wear briefs... So why did you and... Mark break up?
Oh just my wolf paraphernalia. Some people collect beanie babies... I collect silver bullets.
Okay, you busted me.
A man killed in Central Park.
Mark wouldn't hurt a fly.
Still haven't figured out how he or anyone else pulled that off. Never seen anything like it.
Yeah, every guy you date winds up dead.
What's that supposed to mean?
This is a lot worse than "Betty."
They do? Oh no...
No you can't. It... it gets so bad that I become a werewolf.
I'm not afraid. Frida! I love you.
Can't you bite me and then I'll be like you?
I'm so sorry... I... I couldn't help it. You know I didn't mean to... to do any of that.
Okay.
Let's explore this. What makes you feel you're a werewolf?
We didn't have sex.
Two bags for them, and one bag for your head in case her two fall off.
It's so bad she becomes a werewolf.
We can just take this pillowcase.
Why would you want to be a cop?
Waiting for DNA tests. He was hairier than Madonna in Penthouse.
She's not a suspect. What is her motive? There's nothing, NOTHING connecting her to either crime except that she dated both guys.
Like a vampire or some shit?
And that was 28 days ago today.
Just this morning. Animal hairs were found all over the victims.
Only two bucks.  Shave as well...
What of?
He's seriously disturbed...
I think it's time you introduced us to your little friends.
You wouldn't believe me if I told you, Inspector.  Have patience  - you'll see for yourself.
Yes.  This way.
Iíll be the judge of that.  Anything else?
<u>Fine</u>?  Look here!
Yes, sir.  <u>Everything</u>?
Don't know much, do you?
What?
This ocean business...  I know where I can find a map.  I need to go back to the station.  Where will you be?
What?  Who has?
No...  No doctor...
Shut up, freak!  Monster!  You are insignificant.
You seem restless.
Asks my name.  Over and over.  Just like a broken record.  Only thing is, I can't answer.  I've no idea what my name <u>is</u>.
I'm nothing then.
Don't ask stupid questions.  Look at it.
Nothing.  I don't know anything!
We are...  living in their dreams...
It's the truth...  I need you.  I know you're innocent.
Uh -- I don't know.   Sometimes it's just like a barter thing...  Is this legal?
You're kidding?
We'll be back for you first thing tomorrow and if you need me for anything, Duane will be right outside the door.
I promise.  I won't.
What the hell is this ?
Alan
) Listen, you little...
You mean the press conference?  I have a couple of ideas I wanted to share with the country.
I said you're fired.  Go on -- get outta here.
Fine...
I can't believe he'd do this.
Exactly. A condition.
What about containment, Alan?
What do you mean, he's clean?
Are you out of your mind?
Oh.  Excuse me.
I don't want him caring about his wife! What about the Vice President!
Couple of days.  Anyhow, look at these tracking polls, they'll burn up in your hands: seventy- three percent with seniors, eighty- four with working mothers...
I'm going to kill him.
... But as I began to investigate, I realized that this pattern of corruption extended much higher...
I was gonna do something with Joan.
It's fine.
The government
... Somewhere there is a distant light, guiding us through this rocky shoal...'
What?
But we went there.  We saw those kids.
Does it make the cars any better?
So we're spending forty-seven million dollars to make people feel better about a car they've already bought?
What?
Certainly.
Go tuck yourself, Bill.
Yeah.  I'm sure it's keeping you up nights.
I'm not the First Lady, anymore.  I shouldn't be here.
I don't know.  I hadn't thought it out that far.
Truman used it all the time.
Oh... Okay.
I mean, I want to... I just, I feel strange...
Looks like we're not going to get a chance to get much done.
Hi.
Two of us...only two of us...me...and him. 
There are no...headquarters. There are no...rebels. Only the walking dead. Don't you see. They have won.
To look...look for a place...a place to live in...an empty place...a... new...place...
SIDDOWN, YOUNG LADY! I DONE YUP A SHIT-LOAD O' FAVOURS AND I AIN'T NEVER YET ASKED FER NOTHIN' IN RETURN! NOW HOW'D YOU LIKE TA SPEND TWO WEEKS UP T'THE VEGETABLE FARM YERSELF? THAT'S WHAT IT'LL BE IF YA DON'T SIDDOWN AN' SHUT THE HELL UP!
It's not a very big army. And small as it is you won't be able to continue feeding it for very long. We've got to find ways of getting them to respond without relying on...
We ran up against a platoon of soldiers. There were actually walking dead...in uniform...with guns.
That's why we didn't use prayers on this here white coat 'til after he was destroyed. We ready to fight when we have to. And we gotta fight now.
Farther than you think. You'll get lost. You will. And there's Bees all through the jungle. I ain't lyin' to ya. Religiosos don't lie.
Datura Metel. The Devil's Trumpet. Don't worry. I ain't goin' religioso again. It's a flower that grows on these islands. Where I come from the voodoo priests used it whenever they needed a Mickey Finn. It's toxic. Ground up you can put it in a drink or inject it...or...in a sealed area it might be introduced through the ventilation system.
It's...he was...one who came to the island with me.
Forever, darlin'. Forever. 'Til he turns ta dust and blows away on the wind.
We're gonna blow up the powder magazine.
The purpose of decapitation is to preserve as much...food...as possible. The purpose for feeding is to keep the beasts on our side. The fact that they can be taught to clean up our garbage or to fire a gun is a convenient side benefit, not the primary goal. The primary goal is to keep ourselves from becoming their supper. Keep them fed and they behave. Keep them hungry and they revert back to being the animals that they have always been. You saw them in there.
You can believe this, Miguel. I'll kill you if you shoot. We must wait. I'll....I'll do it....I'll do it myself....when it needs to be done.
You better not mess with me, Rhodes. I'd love to serve your balls to those Red Coats for lunch! Think about it!
We're both gonna leave. Leave the island. I've been talkin' to Tricks. We think we can smuggle out one of those inflatable rafts. They're crated up real small. They've got air canisters. There's food inside. Even a little motor.
Need what? Civilised order like we have down here? Christ!
I'll have somebody's ass for this. I'll have your ass, soldier. I'm not gonna stand here and...
My..."detail", sir. We're going to bury the heads.
I'm alright. Let's go.
Say Steve, where's your manners?  Here's Mutt's brother and you don't offer him a drink? Want some bourbon?
Knox?
Knox Overstreet.
Yeah!  Tell him off!  It couldn't get any worse.
Women swoon!
At Chet Danburry's house.
Yep.
How about a trig study group?  Right after dinner.
Garden?
Oh come on, Pitts...
I thought I'd be spontaneous.  I mean, that's the point of this whole thing, isn't it?
Why? Nobody knows who we are.
So much the better.
Sucking out the marrow doesn't mean getting the bone stuck in your throat, Charles.  You still have responsibilities to yourself and those who care about you.
So keep your head about you--the lot of you--understood?
I think you're sweet.
Doing fine, sir.
Yeah, chemistry.  My father thought I should get ahead.
That's not my fault.
Oh yeah.  Sure.  Valedictorian, National Merit Scholar
Are you kidding?  Don't be ridiculous.
It does?  What?
Stop what?
But, Chris...
All I'm asking you to do is listen.  "The heavens made a girl named Chris, With hair and skin of gold To touch her would be paradise To kiss her glory untold."
Knox, why are you doing this to me?
Just give me one chance.  If you don't like me after tonight, I'll stay away forever.
I promise.  Dead Poets honor.  Come with me tonight, then if you don't want to see me again, I swear I'll bow out.
Chet won't know anything.  We'll sit in back and sneak away as soon as it's over.
My Word
What is wrong with old habits, Mr. Overstreet?
Carpe Diem... seize the day.
Rahesh Non never existed, Mr. Meeks. You make him or someone like him up.  No self important college professor such as this one would dare admit ignorance of such an obviously important figure and you will probably receive a comment similar to the one I received:
A sweaty-toothed madman with a stare that pounds my brain.
I have something.
Maybe they don't want worldly things distracting me from my teaching.
Then you're playing a part for him too, aren't you?  A dangerously self- destructive one.
Eighteen!  That's two years!  What about the play?  The performance is tomorrow night!
It's not too bad.  It's a tragedy! Why does she have to be in love with a jerk?!
You have another choice.
Then you can help him.
God, I want to do everything!  I'm going to explode.
Fellows, would you excuse us a minute?
Yes sir.  I'm sorry.
Yes sir.
Well, you've won the booby prize.  Don't expect to like it here.
I'll take him over mine.
Nothing.
I don't want to read.
Keating said everybody took turns reading.  I don't want to do it.
A play, dummy.
So I'm gonna act!  Ever since I can remember I've wanted to try it.  Last summer I even tried to go to summer stock auditions but of course my father wouldn't let me.
First I gotta get the part, then I'll worry about that.
Horseshit.  Nothing's impossible.
From my father and Nolan.
I will be with thee straight.
This play?
I'll come to the performance.
We have to make it to the third deck...
We're going to die here! We're going to die!
Which question is that?
Dead.
That's where my boat's moored.
Or maybe we're exactly where they want us to be.
Jesus Christ lady...
With the emphasis on SELF, and in selfish, right?
He's not coming...
I know...I know...if the cash is there we don't care...  Finnegan this is as mean a pile of shit as we ever carried...
That's it? That's all you give a shit about?
What? You don't think I can have a normal life?
That way.
A little to the left...
I have been.
One whistle... Start the engine...
You're beautiful what you're jealous, you know that, Joey?
Poolside?
Hey! Come out here!
Hey! You hear me? Come out!
What is it man?
Shut up!
She fucked you?
I know...
Fuckin' A!
I'll get it! Where is it?
She might!!! She might do it, Albert, but you can't fuckin' tell me that she does!!!
It won't open.
Where should I hit it? Just show me where I should hit it.
Couple of weeks... Listen --
You mean...?
Yeah.
Angela, I just heard Sal was alive.
What hospital is he in? Where?
Hey, Angela, Sal and I go back a long way.
You are frightened, no?
Naw.
Oh, well...
Fine. Hey, I'm fine.
Sal's alive???
Here.
Sure. Are you kidding? Sure.
Will you marry me?
That was nothing. That wasn't anything.
Is that what it is? I couldn't figure out.
Oh, no. It just kind of goes thump. Would you like a Coke? You don't drink Coke. Or maybe you do. What about champagne? Let's have champagne! I don't think we have champagne. Let's have this. See? Sparkling. I'll get you an opener. Oh, that's right. No opener. Let's just have beer. Do you want some cheese? Or maybe eggs? Maybe we should have coffee.
Right here.
I don't know.
I... No. You do this for money?
Merle, I wanna go home!
I know.
I don't know... I guess I think about the deer... Being out, maybe. I don't know. I think about it all. Hell, I like the trees, you know? I like the ways the trees are, all the different ways the trees are too.
Pow.
Pow.
Merle --
What are you, God?
What else?
You're right... Okay, you're right.
What do you mean?
With more bullets?... Against each other?... Are you crazy!!! Are you fucking nuts!!!
No!!!?
John Wayne... Listen, Nick --
Yeah.
But, Nick... Hey, I mean, where would a guy like Merle get money like this?
Aw, it's a long story!
Great. Feels great... Fuckin' A!
Never one.
They have these little sticks, Vince. They call them "chomp chomps", and when you get these girls going, you have to stick 'em in their mouths.
Down.
I can smell it.
Well, he's sure working fast ain't he?
What did you say?
Kimberly!
Put that on your political resume.
Maybe re-animating you wasn't such a bright idea.  You look like shit.
I was set up and you know it... but you swore under oath I was dirty. You helped bury me.
I'm going to bring this down hard. I've got an A-1 badass killer loose, an election day after tomorrow, and I'm risking everything on you. You're going to bring him in.  I don't care how.  If you do, you'll get your freedom.  An official pardon from me.  A clean slate.  A good job.  A chance to get back with your family.  If you don't want to, I'll put your ass back in the freezer so fast, you'll forget you were ever defrosted.
I've been alone for twenty years. I don't feel very sociable.
Out of the room.
I'll be alright.
And I want Doucet.
We seem to've come across a 211, sir.
Telephone repairman.
Fine.
Whoa.  Don't touch that.  <u>Pursuit</u> <u>Mode</u>.  Auto pilot.  Computerized steering and driving system used in high speed pursuits.  Installed Fall 2006.  Underground rumor has it they modeled it after you, sir.
Commissioner Gallagher said...  ...twenty years is a long time.
There's no time.  There are civilians in there.  It's about to go down.
You can't catch this man with a computer.
This is where I found Doucet twenty years ago.  Thought maybe he'd come back.
I'll be okay.
Good night.
Never use it.  Stuff'll kill ya.
We get to peek into Doucet's brain.
Lighten up.  You're going to give yourself an ulcer.
What else did he get?
<u>Comwatch Dispatch System</u>.  Can't assimilate voice stress.  Code priority only.
I'm here.
That's just it.  He never did time. Seems each arrest was botched for one reason or another.  Judge threw out the cases each time.  Either he's got a horseshoe up his ass or powerful friends.
No you don't.
Take a look at this.
Yeah.
What's your name?
This little thing says I can't.
They're just outsiders. They want to see how fine Jabez Stone lives these days. They're waiting for your guests, too --
Thank you, Belle --
That's my problem, Belle.
I see you! Riding pretty high, ain't you? Look out you don't fall off.
Howdy, Hank.
Not at all, Hank ... not at all. Glad to help you.
That's fair enough, Jabez. Man's got a right to mull things over. We'll drive round again, week or so.
I'll look out for myself! ... Now go away -- leave me alone.
Hello, Stevens ... you're early today.
What a fine boy you have, Jabez. How old is he now?
You are afraid!
Opportunities?
Well, why should that worry you. A soul -- a soul is nothing. Can you see it, smell it, touch it? -- No! -- Think of it -- this soul -- your soul -- a nothing, against seven whole years of good luck! You will have money and all that money can buy. Upon my word, Neighbor Stone, if it weren't for my firm's reputation for generous dealing--
A pin, Neighbor Stone! I'm afraid, you'll have to prick your finger -- but what's a little pain to a lucky man?
Well, I'll be -- 
Look here now--
Small? Oh, I see what you mean. Why, they vary.  Now a man like Daniel Webster, if I ever get hold of him, I'd have to build a special box for him and even at that, I imagine, the wing spread would be astonishing.  In your case --
I have still a year -- a year to make up for everything.
Never!
Gentlemen, the prosecution rests.
Thank you, Mr. Webster.
They'd have a good neighbor, Jabez -- and that's worth much more than anything else -- much, much more!
Shall we?
Morning, Jabez.
Camomile tea!
Oh yes -- yes. Won't take a minute. Can you keep a secret?
Coming.
Now, Jabez! I've got on my Sunday bonnet and I'm going to church with my husband. Almost the first time since the beginning of winter -- and if that isn't an occasion, I don't know what is.
Do you think I'm grudging it?
Jabez -- you ought to talk to Tom about joining the Grange.
Jabez ...
No, Jabez -- all I need is some rest -- You go and pay our debt. Everything'll be all right then ... everything.
Jabez!
Yes, Mary.  It's been a long day.
Mary -- you just wait and see -- It's all -- just the beginning -- just the beginning -- of everything. I'll be the biggest man in New Hampshire and you'll be the wife of the biggest man.
I am going to lock him up.
Oh, Jabez! ...  Did you hear, Mr. Webster? --  Now you'll help him, won't you?
That's right, Ma -- we ain't licked yet. A Stone's never licked till he's dead -- that's what Dad used to say, didn't he, Ma?
I dunno.
I can't help it. I mean it, I tell you. I've had more than my share. Nothing ever goes right for me -- nothing!
Lan's, I'd think you was having the baby, to hear you.
Ma -- and yet, a man could change that, couldn't he?
Make out? We'll do better than that!  I never thought I'd be glad for bad luck, but I am. I never thought I'd be glad of a hail storm at harvest time, but I am! Oh, bless ye the works of the Lord in the hail and the storm and the rain!
Ma! ...  Where's Mary ... and little Dan'l?
It's all right, Sheriff.
Hello, Jabez -- I was just talking to Stevens about a little extension on your payment.
Mary -- Jabez --
Yes, Jabez -- don't worry.
Mr. Webster, you mustn't believe all that people say.
Mary -- what love and trust could do for your husband, you've done. And frankly, in a very few moments, this is going to be no place for a lady.
She'll be here in a moment. She has a special surprise for you.
Hullooo!
Let it be the quick or the dead -- So it is an American judge and an American jury!
Why don't you?
Do I?  I'm sorry.  You're gonna have to help me, man.  This is my first time driving a limo.
It's okay, it's okay.
But meant her moving here.
So, why didn't you come?
Hey, business is business.  You use a gun, I use a fountain pen, what's the difference?  To put it in my terms, you're here on a hostile takeover and you grab us for some greenmail but you didn't expect a poison pill was gonna be running around the building.  Hans, baby...I'm your white knight.
The guy upstairs who's fucking things up?  I can give him to you.
Karl, I know you want him, but the police are probably on their way. Maybe we can convince them it was all a mistake, but not if they hear gunshots! If you lock him in he'll be neutralized -- now do it!  Karl?  Karl!
You want...money?  What kind of terrorists are you?
Who are you, then?
Actually, I was always partial to Roy Rogers.  I really dug those sequined shirts.
Go fuck yourself.
They invited me to the Xmas party. Who knew?
William Clay.  Call me Bill.
Put it down now.
When you're hot, you're hot.
Good enough.  And unless you like is messy, you'd better start taking us in groups to the bathroom.
I'm an exceptional thief, Mrs. McClane. And now that I'm moving up to kidnapping, you should be more polite.
It's a long story.  You know, I think that Ellis has his eye on you.
Oh...Where does he live?
Especially my name.  You must miss it every time you write a check.  When did you start calling yourself 'Ms. Gennero'?
'Sugar, enriched flour, partially hydrogenated vegetable oil, polysorbate 60 and yellow dye #5.'
I'm here, cowboy.
In my youth, partner.  In my youth.
I...I shot a kid.
I got it.  But you can tell her yourself.  Just watch your ass and you'll make it.
-- all we know?  We don't know shit, Powell.  If there's hostages why hasn't anyone asked for ransom?  If there's terrorists, where's their goddamn list of demands?  All we know is that someone shot up your car, and it could be the same flake you've been talking to on the radio!
This is Deputy Chief Robinson.  Who is this?
No.  I never smile any more.
They jet's comin' out.  But don't let 'em off the ground.
Yeah.
Okay.
What about the kids?
He says he doesn't know.  Why don't you cook whatever's there?
Honey, send out for Kentucky fried chicken.  The baby, just open a bottle of prunes, and one of the beef.  The bottles are in the fridge.
I love you.
Yeah, well I don't blame him.
Hello, Sonny.
Ooohh....
You can't talk or do anything.  You really feel... you know... I'm just sort of coming out of it now.
Yeah... I know.
You're crazy.
Where you gonna go?
Howard Johnson's... you're warped. You know that?  You're really warped!
Who's on the phone, now?  What do you mean... throw it on you?  You knew it, right?
Oh no!
He was under great strain: you don't understand, he's a very mixed up person.
It made him crazy - so much demand, he'd fly into this rages.  And I got more depressed than ever; I saw I'd never get the operation.  So I tried to take my life - I swallowed about a half pound of pills ... blues, reds, yellows, downers, uppers, screamers ... you name it. But I just threw them up and wound up in the hospital.  Sonny comes there and looks at me and just says: 'Wow!'  So when I hear he's in the bank, I almost go crazy because I know he's doin' it for me.
I'm not alone.
What do you want to know that for?
So -- you want me to send one out there ... Okay.  I'll see what I can do.
... armed robbery ...
Sonny, come on out!
They were ...
It can't happen again ... I'll do everything I can to stop anything I can ...
He's all doped up.
He hasn't so far.  I'm the one who can make a mistake.  That's what scares the shit out of me.
Do what the gentleman says, Howard.
Well, you get your mind right.  I'm a Catholic and I don't wanna hurt nobody, but goddamn it, don't you play no games with me.  Unnastand?!?
Mulvaney...
I don't care who you are ...  I just want to get you outta here, safe, right?
What now, Sonny?
What are you talking about?  What do you think I'm doin'?  I'm gettin' the ball rollin'.  I'm keeping these people happy ... I'm keeping you happy ... I gotta keep the cops cooled out ... I gotta do everything ... I gotta pay for the pizza ... I'm workin' on it, do you know what I mean?  I'm workin' on it ... Jesus Christ!  I gotta do it all ... I got all the ideas ... you want me to give you the gun?  You want to take it over?
We like you, too.
Why not?
Yeah?
Little smoke: like a Polish four- alarm fire, is all.
I'm glad it's okay.
Howard!
No, not until after they killed him.
Because I'm scared, that's why. You never smoked?
You stopped?  Why?
I want him to think that.
But do you mean in? ... But you just told him that if worse comes to worse...
But I want to know what you think.
Does that still go?
Yeah ...
It's nothing - it just goes up - it's the safest thing in the world. Safer than a car.  Don't worry about it, Sal - it'll be all right ... they're great ...
Get over there!
Have him walk in backwards.
They gotta stop sayin' that.
He was showin' me how the airport bus is comin' in, like that, Sal.  What's wrong with him?
Let's move it, goddamn it.
No more favors.  That's all over, Sonny.
I've got a jet.  I'll have airport limousine here in a half hour.  I want the hostages.
I want them all.
What can he do, he's clean...
I am.
What is it?  Did you just barge in here... He doesn't have plan.  It's all a whim.  'Rob a bank!  What not?'
He's got diabetes.  He's not a well person.
They're beautiful ...
I talked to the FBI, I told them about you, they said if you just come outta the bank it's gonna be okay.
Did I say a thing against her?  God forbid I should say anything against that fat cunt.
Maybe...
No.  This really pissed him off, Sonny.  He says you're dead.  He says he doesn't have a son.
I don't know ... It's where they got the money.  I mean, if you want to steal, you go to where they got the money, right?
Get a job doing what?  You gotta be a member of a union, no union card - no job.  To join the union, you gotta get the job, but you don't get the job without the card.
Oh yeah?  Give up?  You ever been in prison?
Yesterday I received an e-mail from a source. In this e-mail were four social security numbers linked to the gentlemen who presented counterfeit California driver's licenses to my company late last night.
<i>That's the crew. They follow us.</i>
<i>The children like to urinate in the balls.</i>
<i>I'm calling from the Kappa Epsilon Gamma house at California University.</i>
<i>I won't forget this, Domino. I'm sorry it turned out like this...</i>
You white folks don't understand the natural beauty of a woman's figure. Those are birthing hips. More cushion for the pushin'.
<i>Here's the part where I'm supposed to get all defensive and say... 'not until I speak with my attorney.'</i>
He sent us out to the Fender Compound. Out in the desert near the Chicken Ranch.
Mr. Weiss was very generous in turning over some video tapes to the FBI. There's lots of footage of you. We know everything.  If you don't come clean... the information on these tapes could send you to prison for a very long time.
That's the rumor on the street.
No. Please enlighten me.
Turn over your weapon, Edna!
Why must you fight... everything that is normal? You are blessed with such beauty. Life could be so easy... if only you allowed yourself to fit the mold.
Stop it.
I can certainly think of one more!
Domino. Do you have a last name... Domino?
Yeah. I played base guitar for Pat Benatar.
Claremont said we deliver the First Ladies in Needles. Then we go home. No questions asked.
He said... take his right arm.
<i>Turned out Edna. had one last trick up her sleeve.</i> <b> INT. FENDER COMPOUND -- KITCHEN -- [FLASHBACK] TEN MINUTES AGO

I be.  I'm living large.
Yes?
Who told you to buy a brownstone on my block, in my neighborhood on my side of the street?
If I wasn't a righteous Black man you'd be in serious trouble. SERIOUS.
And?
Did you ask Sal?
Jade, I still love you.
No, are you?  We want some Black people up on the Wall of Fame.
I'm cool.  I'm cool.
No.  I'm just a struggling Black man trying to keep my dick hard in a cruel and harsh world.
Don't worry about it.  But when it happens and I'm in my boat and ya black ass is drowning, don't ask me to throw you a lifesaver either.
One day you'll be nice to me.  We might both be dead and buried, but you'll be nice.  At least civil.
Is it a good morning?
OK.  OK.
Later.  Gotta get paid.
I just come home to take a quick shower.
Yo, I'm gone.
He's completely innocent.
I'm getting paid...
I know, Mother Sister, but I'm here now.  Where's the stuff?
Yeah, me too.
I don't know why you still haven't bought an air conditioner.
I'll be back on my feet.  Soon enough.
Can ya dig it?
What?
Who doesn't work?  Don't start no shit, won't be no shit.
Be off in a second.  Tina, I dedicated a record on Mister Señor Love Daddy's show to you.
No, just checking.
Fuck dat.  The time is fuckin' now. Y'know I'm sorry 'bout Sal's Famous Pizzeria, but I gotta live, too. I gotta get paid.
OK.  OK.
When?
How else was I going to get you here?  I haven't seen you in a week.
Where's the ice cream?  The Häagen- Dazs butter pecan?
Tina, you don't have a forehead, you got a eight-head.
Yes, yes, Lord.  Isn't this better than Haagen-Dazs butter pecan ice cream?
You're still late.
Magic Johnson.
Eddie Murphy.
Sounds funny to me.  As much as you say nigger this and nigger that, all your favorite people are "niggers."
Keep dreaming.
You gold-teeth, gold-chain-wearing, fried-chicken-and-biscuit-eatin', monkey, ape, baboon, big thigh, fast-running, three-hundred-sixty- degree-basketball-dunking spade Moulan Yan.
It's Prince.  He's a Prince freak.
Tell Pino.
Don't start on me today.
Baby listen, there's nothing more American than not doing anything and getting away with it.
She's saying... a beautiful swan...
Actually, my name is Cindy, the accent just helps me meet boys.
Well I hope the carpet matches the drapes.
Depends how you define 'new'...
Four colors? Neato!
HARRY Dunne.
Yes, you and the whole Special Needs class.
Hard for me? Hard for me? Hard for me? Hard for me?  You had questions?
What? No! Look.
Well la de da.
I don't follow.
Probably because we've never met.
I go to school where I live.
Can we eat there tomorrow?
And nobody will make fun of your horrible deformity.
HARRY, what are you doing? She's a foreign exchange student. She doesn't speak the English.  CHING CHONG ching chingy chingy chong chong.
A-ha! You landed on Candyland! Now swallow it!
She did not.
Will not.
Shut up!
Okay. Anyone else have any questions?
HARRY, he can and he did. And now it's on like Donkey Kong.
That's why you have to drink it fast, trust me.
What a nerd. I don't know where that girl's ever gonna find a husband.
Sorry. Why are you dressed like a Queen!?
HARRY, I said don't 'dress like a Queen'!
Sucks for you.
You and me? Dream on, desperado.
I'm kidding! Of course I'll be your partner.
Shut up!
Okay, I saw this in a movie once. Open the dining room window and follow my lead. Say what I say.
You have beautiful eyes.
I bet you want your head scratched.
Yeah, right. Why don't you show it to your "girlfriend"?
Yeah, that's why I asked.
I know I did.
D2.
He's like the Pope. Like we're gonna snake a girl away from the Pope.
Three words. I did. But you were all mad at me and wouldn't listen.
But I ate your Mom's pie.
That's because Captain Rob is not a pirate. We've been through this.
She wants us to show the world what a great guy Principal Collins is.
Yes. Screw George Washington. Just like Marilyn Monroe did.
That's gross.
Oh, you're good.
I don't know what you're talking about.
One phone call from the principal will take care of that, my dear.
I don't know what you're talking about.
That's not your tape.
I'll talk to you later.
Come on, I live with the janitor. I have a key to every room in the school.
Let's just do it and get out of here.
Me too. I'm almost there.
You were born free and free you should remain.
Of course it does.  Obviously in denial.  Maybe we can help.
It was meatloaf. You just put everything in your soup.
You know I do!
So I guess you'll need a new spot for your moonshine.
So miss snoopy reporter girl, it appears that you've snooped yourself into a corner and snoopcuffed yourself to a desk. Whose wearing the Coconut bra now?
No, it actually fit quite nicely.  Well, except for the fact that it wasn't really as long as it was wide.
Damn right I did it. Went back and set the house on fire, his little floozy testified in court - and I ended up doing ten years at Rikers, got my teeth knocked out by Mike the Dyke.
Good. Good. Good. Well, that's good.
And I you.
I think you'll make a good teacher.
What?
No you don't know who stole it. Just let me do the thinking.
What does Leto say, Piter?
Yes?... How was your journey?
Oh yes? -- NAVIGATOR Better than those on Richesse.. You are transparent... I see many things... I see plans within plans.
So the Harkonnens will rid you of House Atreides...
LISTEN TO ME!! The spice must flow... the spice has given me accelerated evolution for four thousand years... it has enabled you to live two hundred years... the spice helps make the sapho juice, which gives the red-lipped mentats the ability to be living computers... the secret side of spice... the water of life.
I hope I made myself clear. You may call him "The Duke," "My lord," or "Sire." And there is a more ancient term you might keep in mind -- "Noble Born."
They said you were dead.  They said...
Are you trained in the ways of the desert?
Where are we do you think?
 Where are my feelings... I feel for no one...
The spice!  It's in everything here.  The air, the soil, the food...  It's like the Truthsayer drug.....  It's a poison!!!! You knew the spice would change me.  But thanks to your teachings it's changed my consciousness.  I can see it... I can see it.
You carry my unborn sister in your womb!
You and your Bene Gesserit sisterhood... I'm not your Kwisatz Haderach...  I'm something different, something unexpected!  I'm a seed.  I am so much more...  You don't begin to know me...
 ...the night is a tunnel... a hole into tomorrow... if we're to have a tomorrow...
Yes...
No.
To protect their territory. Vibrations attract them. -- PAUL  I've registered him now... a knife is a sheath on his left arm... He's strong... a person born to command... He's hiding many things.  Is there a relationship between the worms and the spice?
Too bad... thought they were Harkonnen.
I hold at your neck the gom jabbar. Don't pull away or you'll feel that poison. A Duke's son must know about many poisons -- this one kills only animals.
They tried and died....  Jessica!
Those sounds could be imitated.
My father sent you to test me. Music then?
Greetings.  I am Slick Slomopavitz, Seeker of Adventure.
"Beg to differ?!"  Hey, I'm talkin' about my duplex in Burbank!
I predict we're lost.
I told you, I don't want any of your goddamn coffins.
Eh, that was a terrible production. Renfield was a drunk!
Don't you bave a car?
I have no next picture.
I never thought of that.
Hey Bela, how do you do that?
Of course!  Dracula requires <u>presence</u>.  It's all in the voice, and the eyes, and the hand --
So let's make another "Dracula." Let's make "The Return of Dracula"!
Ah!  This is very exciting.
I didn't feel well...
That's fine, Bela.  We're still rolling.  Just say "Dear, you're lovely."
Bad decisions are easy to live with. Forget.  Just keep looking forward.
Bela, somebody misplaced the motor. So when you wrestle the octopus, shake the legs a bit, to make it look like it's killing you.
Huh?
That's fine, Eddie.  All in the line of duty.
Shit!  Bela, what's with the gun?
Eddie, I received a letter from the government.  They're cutting off my unemployment.  That's all I've got. Without it, I can't pay the rent...
I'm obsolete.  I have nothing to live for.  Tonight, I should die.  And you should come with me.
Uh... you're a very important and respected man.  You're leaving your house... and you're in a hurry to a big social event.
Yes!  I've dreamed of it for years, but your movie made me realize I've got to take action.  GOODBYE, PENIS!
And once I'm a woman, Jean-Claude and I are getting married --
Rolling.
Nothin'!  I told him he was great.
These shoes are itchy.
I'm Criswell.  I know all.
I guessed.
I made it up.  It's horseshit!
Isn't he?
What?
Aw, er, it's just a bunch of hot air. I had to say something to get in the door.
Boris Karloff!?
<u>That's not the issue</u>!!  Ugh!  How can you act so casual, when you're dressed like that?!
No he's not!  Do you realize how much money he made for this studio over the years?  "Dracula"!  "The Raven"! "The Black Cat"!
Nobody in town has seen it, so I'm givin' you first crack at my talents.
But Bela Lugosi's in it!
Raising money is tough.
Would that work?
Oh, of course!
No.  With hair, yah.  But I must shave head for wrestlink.  It scare da crowds.  Dey like that.
But I thought me and Dolores had something.
We're escaping!
Tell me about it.  I'm supposed to do a thriller at Universal, and they want Charlton Heston to play a <u>Mexican</u>!
It is when it works.  You know the one film of mine I can stand to watch?  "Kane."  The studio hated it... but they didn't get to touch a frame.  Ed, visions are worth fighting for. Why spend your life making someone else's dreams?
So you're not gonna make the movie?
Who?
I don't think he's a schmuck.
I know a guy in Universal's stock house -- he's giving me the footage for free.  This movie's gonna look like a million bucks.
Gee, I used every frame of film we shot.  Maybe they won't notice.
I did.  I established some tits and ass.
You can't talk that way about my movie.
Oh, hi.
Nah, 'cause I had my comic books. And I read pulp magazines.  And I listened to the radio dramas...
No! I love sex with girls.
Thanks.  It's actually the only thing I know how to make.  Hey, can you grab that strainer?
Ed, you've got to snap out of this. Bela's dead -- <u>you're not</u>!
Let's get married.
No.  I think my film is perfect for you.
No!  I don't want you to show the movie, I want you to be <u>in it</u>!  See, maybe I should explain: We started shooting, but then after three days we got shut down.  So we're having a backers party, to raise some more money.  Perhaps you'd like to come next door and meet some of the backers...?
It's terrible.  People won't even return my calls.  It's like I don't exist.
Here's to Ed.  For making us into something.
Great!  Bring 'em in!  Bunny, I gotta run.
Mr. Wood!
It's made from specially-bred rabbits that live in the Himalayas.
No, I work in pictures.  I'm a director-actor-writer-producer.
Look, you seem like a nice guy, Ed, but you're just not my type.  But keep in touch.  Let me know when your movie opens.
Do they show it?
At what point?
Went --
This is real, Bananahead!
So if it's a show and they have a guy die that's writing, but if it's real and they have a guy die that's murder.
Oh, see, studying would've been a huge help. Where were you, then?
A woman wants to be pursued.
That means a balloon payment and a big raise for the second month.
What if Shari's the dream?
I've got this great idea. We put together a video. "The Network Executives Goofiest Moments." And listen, i've really loved working here.
Mm...  Oh, man...
What about him -- did he suffer any or was it quick? I'd hate to think he...
No.  The deceased is ... Henry Pekurny.
Look at this -- people are getting married, they're getting married...
I'm gonna stick this right in your eye.
So everything he told me yesterday was a lie. Everything.
Holy sh--
Could've been a nurse?
He had a woman in my own bed! And how dare you call him "Dad" in front of Al.  This is your father. This is who was there for you when you needed someone.
And what did he come back now for?
Mom?
The doctor said you were having sex.
Well, he's the only one in America who doesn't!
Ma...
She really doesn't want you and the camera in here right now.
No.
What are you talking about?
Not too good. That's why it states in your contract that if you do not continue to live a normal life, you're in violation and are liable for the station's financial losses. Ed, I urge you to reconsider. I urge you on behalf of all those people out there whose lives have become so entwined with yours. Play fair with them, Ed.
Ed, he needs a break. You don't know what kind of bad luck he's had --
It means they hate his freaking guts. It means if he were on fire they wouldn't put him out.
Never would be plenty.
I hear the dog really liked him.
Really? You see, to me, you shouldn't have any trouble with men. There should be, like, a line behind you.
Shari, I'm just really sorry. Look, I know this is... unbelievably awkward, but if I could come in for like a second and -- you know -- just say... two words, then...
Really?
That's lucky.
Shari...
No. Who?
Ohh...
So?
Oh Je -- couldn't he sleep with Rita? We'11 all have a good time.
Come on, let's go.
Somewhere.
Just... just relax. Okay? We won't do anything. We'11 just sit here for a while.
It's what I do. I yell "Geronimo" and jump out of a relationship.
I know. I mean I'm sitting there and her father's asking me about my "career prospects" and I'm playing "Risk," with her kid brother, Leon and at dinner the dog's sniffing at my balls -- at least I hope it was the dog. 'Cause her mother disappeared for a while.
You're in show business?
What?
Hey. You know-- we're not the same. I got a good life, this job suits me. I come and go when I please --
Yeah. You know, piano bars. plays the piano and sings. That's how they met.
We'd better go...
Stop? I'm a guy. I don't stop. The woman's supposed to stop. We're the gas, they're the brakes.
Ray, come an--
Yeah. My problem is I've got a brother who writes a sentence like "We grew up in a small, little bedroom." As opposed to a big, little bedroom?
A hundred per cent cotton. Okay, here we go, Andy.
Oh, is Shari here? Why didn't you just say so? Why are you giving me a song-and-dance about being tired?
What?... Why?
Thanks... That's ...
That Ray was a pig. Ed is doll. You latch on to him honey.
Look, Jim...  Okay.  I know it all seems crazy, and maybe it did start out, you know, for the... for the sex and the danger.  But now it's different.  Jim, what I'm trying to tell you is that Tracy and I are totally, totally in love.
Yeah, it's serious.  I mean she inspires me in ways Sherry never has. She even wants to read my novel.
That's the whole point. It's all in my head; it's right here.  I just got to get it out there. Tracy wants me to write it so she can read it.  It's beautiful.
He ended up moving back to Milwaukee to live with his parents. I haven't heard from him in a long time. Poor guy. I warned him.
You know, Tracy... I don't know how to say this, but...
Here, get down.
Anything wrong?
Yeah, just --
So nice
I thought those were the rules, Mr. McAllister. If they've changed in any way --
But, Mr. M. -
Hey, that's super
You bet.
Should be easy.  So far no competition.
Looks like Tim Kobza.
Wait - are you accusing me? You're not serious.  I can't... Mr. McAllister, we have worked together on SGA for three solid years and... I mean, I can't believe it. I'm... I'm shocked!
6:30.  How do you know what time the posters were torn down?
Uh-huh.
I've got an idea.
Okay, Jim. I understand.
Well, this is hard for me, but I think it's important to be honest. Don't you?
I did it.
Sure.
Sherry... I love you.
Yeah, no, she's a go-getter, all right.
Yeah.  But one person assured of victory kind of undermines the whole idea of a democracy, doesn't it? That's more like a... well, like a dictatorship, like we studied.
Huh?  Oh.  Uh... pears
I'm not a dyke, okay, and we're not in love. We were just... I was just experimenting.
You know, I don't understand why everybody bad-mouthed Tracy all the time.  She was always super- nice to me.
Oh, yeah, sure.  Hey Nolan, give my book to Tracy when you're done*
What'd I do?
Oh.  Hi, Tammy.  I was just, you know, I went to all your teachers and got your assignments.
What's it to you?
Yeah, plain scotch.
Are you sorry she's dead?
It's Bud.
When I was ten, my old man threw a bottle at my mother.  I guess I got in the way.
Yeah.  But not for long.
I used to.  What I do now is strong-arm.  Sitting duck stuff... No, I don't like it.  If I could work Homicide like a real detective...
You gonna tell me what happened with you and Exley?
This business, Captain?
He made his play amd he got what he wanted.  They're making him a detective.
Lad, I admire your refusal to testify and your loyalty to your partner.  I admire you as a policeman, particularly your adherence to violence as a necessary adjutant to the job. And I am most impressed with your punishment of wife beaters.  Do you hate them, Wendell?
Your partner's through. Department scapegoat on the Chief's orders.  He's been billed, he'll be indicted and he'll swing.
I knew you had juice, but... There's no goddamn bill on me?
How?
What work?
Seen him around.  He used to be a cop.
What was that boyfriend's name?
Look at a picture for me.
Easy.  Tell me about the ruckus.
Someone held up a coffee shop, panicked and killed six people.
Patchett uses a lot of ex-cop muscle.
He had help getting up there.  Two of his fingers are broken.
A lot of bad stuff happened here. It's as good a place as any for it to end.
You know I do or you wouldn't be here.  How did you find me?
He no longer works for me.  Find Susan's killer, Mr. White. I'll give you a handsome reward. <u>Whatever you desire</u>.
Do you care about criminal matters peripheral to Susan's murder?
Then you wouldn't feel obligated to report them?
Wait.  Our deal still holds?
That's why her mother couldn't I.D. her... Jesus fucking Christ.
I got her address.
And you fuck people up for a living.  That don't make me you. <u>Capisce</u>, shitbird?
More.
I got a few Nite Owl questions.
I'm tying up loose ends.  Padding my report.  You know how it goes.
Anything off.  Anything that didn't make sense.
Dick Stensland.  Had to be dumb panic.  If she knew him she would've been sitting with him... Right?
Until he gunned down six people.
Man, why're you talkin' about Larry?  His business is his business.
Man, what're you saying?
Trashcan Jack.  The Big V.  I can tell you he's on the Night Train to the big adios.
And?
At least get rid of the glasses. I can't think of one Bureau man who wears them.
I'll break them, sir.
There always are.  But there are also three men and three guns. Matched forensically.  A few loose ends don't matter.
Why not, lad?  Absolute justice?
Okay.  I'll do it.
I think you'll be surprised what Edmund's capable of.
What?
Rollo was a purse snatcher.  My father ran into him off duty.  He shot my father six times and got away clean.  No one even knew who he was.  I made the name up to give him some personality.
A third.  I don't think we can make a case without Bud White.
What?
Oh, the best I ever had. Absolutely the best.
You're the first person to ever call me tough.
You, me and White, huh?
What's Dudley's scheme?
Mrs. Lefferts, I just want to ask a few questions.
Under the house.
No.  It's felony possession of marijuana.
Sid, it's Vincennes.
Sure, he just tried to throw me off the force last Christmas as a little joke.
I put Reynolds in the cab myself. The night cost me a hundred scoots and I got bupkis.
This is Sgt. Vincennes. Requesting a name and address on a phone number.  Hollywood zero-one- two-three-nine.
I just called it.
Brill's dead. He died of small pox when he was two and he was buried in a Kansas field.  My name doesn't matter.
Oh Jesus.
Nothing.
I'm telling you, I--
He didn't give you an address? He didn't give you a phone number?
Who are you calling?!
Goddammit, shut the fuck up and turn on CNN!
Why?
I don't know who he is.
The NSA?
Like a LowJack, but two generations ahead of what the police use. It pulses at 230 Giga-Hertz.
Look, you gave me some work over the last year. We'll call it even.
And you won't. Now move--
Oh, I'll bet <u>that</u> threw 'em off the scent. I sure hope you covered the mouthpiece with a handkerchief and used a funny voice!
How do you know so much?
How'd you get around the tap orders?
Jesus.
Jesus. Do you have proof?
Who?
Why?
Those are Feds.
Oh my God...
Let's not do the tire thing anymore, okay?
Tell me about it.
Tell him we're not gonna hurt him.
So what do we do now?
What if we do a mailing to Congressmen.
Listen--
What if--
How fast can you learn?
Not particularly, no.
Are you sure about this?
Oh my God.
Hello. Hello, Maria.
You're a tough nut to crack, Dylan.
Can you help me?
I don't know anything about this. Well, I mean, I know a <u>little</u> about--from a certain perspective. My point is, I don't want to do anything foolish.
Pardon?
Eight.  Size eight.
Could you give me just a moment to talk to a friend of mine here? Not about this, but...Daniel?
Daniel's life is already ruined. Maybe if you guys stopped thinking about yourselves for a change and--
I didn't want to bother you during your racquetball game.
I'm no expert, but I'm assuming that the impact of a moving bus against his body caused--
I can't.
Than why don't you talk to the bus driver?
No.
No, sir.
This guy's a fat-assed Rotarian gasbag.
Just for the criminals.
I think you're taking it seriously enough for both of us.
A toaster. And no terrorist talk at dinner. You're spookin' the kids.
What do you mean?
No.
Well, you know--
It's not real...  That's not me.
This is science-fiction Robert! The manager showed me the transfer notice with your signature on it.
Here, you can use this.
I've got photographs of you at the Trenton Ramada looking very--
That's probably not you in the picture. I tell you what, I'll just run the thing by the Grand Jury, see if they can't--
Good news there, Mr. DePinto, you're talking to one.
Not that much.
It's how he works.
I take a straight 15 percent. Brill's fee varies with risk. Perhaps you'd be more comfortable using someone else.
All right, look--
You got a minute?
For the last four years.
We're screwed.
Goddammit, Rachel, you assured me--
What're you gonna do, Rachel? You gonna sit in a bar in Baltimore? You want your job back? You want a life?
I'm sorry about that.
We'd like to ask you some questions about Daniel Zavitz.
We have good reason to believe that he passed you--
We'd rather not--
You're firing me.
Mr. Dean--
Where's Stacy?
Really?
Where's mom?
Men don't win fights with women, son, I'll tell you about that sometime, too. In the meantime, I've got a question for you, and it's incredibly important that you tell me the truth. Under no circumstances will I be angry with you. This is a total Get-Out-Of- Jail-Free card. Ready?
Usually they take clothes.
What about jewelry?
They didn't take the silverware?
Sounds like they didn't want anything that wasn't electric?
An investigation? It was a bus accident.
Why would the NSA--
You're tired.
To the cops?
No. No, it's okay.
Yeah?
Jerry?
You remember Daniel Zavitz?
He got hit by a bus.
I honestly don't know.
Several indiscriminates and one primary who we've ID'd as Robert Dean. A Crystal City attorney.  Mr. Reynolds?  Sir?
Hiding something?
We believe?
Resources, that's a good point. He's got resources. All we've got is a <i>six-hundred billion dollar</i> <i>organization!</i> Now god<u>dammit</u>, Hicks, you find 'em. You find 'em and you end it now!
What's your ETA?
I also have tiny pizzas and mushrooms stuffed with--
As the wife of one of our party.
What do you mean, poetry?
Her or me?
In an hour there will be no stars. The air is filling with sand.
Of course.  Is it, am I a terrible coward to ask how much water we have?
And the marriage - is that a fiction? 
I believe you still have my book.
You don't sew at all!
It's a folk song.
No, no, it's Hungarian.  My daijka sang it to me.
I thought we were against ownership?  I can stay tonight.
Don't go over it again, please.
I can't move.  I can't get out.
We've got to get you out of here.
I know, darling, I'm sorry.
What?
Don't talk.
Listen to me, Katharine.  You've broken your ankle and I'm going to have to try and bind it.  I think your wrist might be broken, too - and some ribs, which is why it's hurting you to breathe.  I'm going to have to walk to El Taj.  Given all the traffic in the desert these days I should bump into one army or another before I reach there - or Fenelon-Barnes and his camel.  And then I'll be back and we'll be fine, and I'll never leave you.
You too.  Good luck!
Sorry, what's your point?
I desperately need a jeep.  There's been an accident.
Looking for the fossils.  Why should we wait until we're in London?  This girl was probably twelve years old.
I looked at them.  They're shrubs, small trees.  Exquisite.  And fossilized, rock hard. He walks away to the nose of the plane.
Try to get a second radiator, we'll bury it between here and the Pottery Hill. And a better jack. We planned badly.
No, because you can't see from the air! If you could explore from the air life would be very simple!  Look!  What is that?  Is that a wadi? That whole spur is a real possibility…
What do we find in the desert? Arrow heads, spears.  In a war, if you own the desert, you own North Africa.
There is no God.  But I hope someone looks after you.
Shut-up!
I keep explaining.  You've got the wrong man.  My name is Bellini - Antonio Bellini.  Bellini, Caravaggio, both painters, I think that is confusing you.
It's impossible.  I was buying or selling something.  I've been to Cairo many times.
So was my Patient.
If you said yes I would have had a reason.  You should let me redress those bandages.  Before you go.
Where've you been?
Some gave me a dress.  You know what's great?  What I'm learning? You win a war and you not only gain the miles you get the moral ground. Everywhere I go, we're in the right. I like that.
I'm not in love with him.  I'm in love with ghosts.  And so is he. He's in love with ghosts.
I've had a drink.  Fatal.
Me?
And you thought you'd come and settle the score?
I had to get back to the desert. I made a promise.  The rest meant nothing to me.
The rest meant nothing to me.
Darling, for goodness' sake!
What?
Oh no, really.  She has her book.
Have to return the favor - take a few photographs for the army.
Me?  He can't.  I'm already disturbed.
Yes?
K is for Katharine.
Really?  That's sudden.
I don't think it does.  Anyway, he's indifferent to me.
You'd better be.
Would you like me to?

The Germans were here.  The Germans were all over this area.  They left mines everywhere.  Pianos were their favorite hiding places.
I've met you before.
Yes, for your hair.
Kip… I -
Then come with me.
I'll always go back to that church.
I'll tell him.  What is it?  Is it a mine?
Sorry.  I took a Benzedrine.
I'm afraid so, sir. Kip hurries to his tent.  Hana follows him.
What's he saying?
Go on, do it.  I don't need to hear any more.
Why?  Are you German?
This was your garden?
I don't recall asking your permission.
Entry through the doors or vents triggers instant alarm.
Let a thousand flowers bloom. Chairman Mao.
Why didn't I think of that?
How would you approach him? Hello, Mr. MacDougal, I'm Gin, would you steal a painting with me?
And a target guaranteed to catch his interest.
Then don't.
Uh, yes.
Of course you wouldn't. The Rembrandt wouldn't fit.
Oh, I'm taking you...quite seriously.
So what?
So you've heard all those stories about me. Well, I can assure you they're not true. And if they were true, I've retired.
Possibly.
Quite a good one. A Monet. Not major, but it is Giverney.
Damn, I knew I forgot something.
Up to you. You could tell him the check is in the mail.
Certainly not mine. Come on.
You really don't believe I'd take on a partner after all these years without a little...insurance?
A lifelong problem, I'm afraid.
You're too easily impressed with yourself. I believe I've made that point before.
No one <u>needs</u> anything except food and shelter. The rest we just want.
No. It's a down payment.
Oh, I think you can do it. Probably.
We are...for the tools.
Straight down the drive, right at the hedgerow, follow the lane. Don't blink, you'll miss it.
When I was a girl my father took me to the edge of El Capitan. Three thousand feet of granite. Straight down. I was so scared my mouth was full of cotton. I couldn't talk, just stood there shivering...like this.
My father told me not to be afraid. He'd always be there for me.
He pulled back his arms and blam, I landed right on the floor. I picked myself up, tears in my eyes, and he looked at me and he said, Son, don't ever trust anybody. Anybody.
In eye of that painting.
Duh.
Get the hell in.
I always knew you'd do the job.
Would you quiet down! Just for a minute?
Transfer.
We're doing it tonight.
I've covered everything. And you're the best, so--
Feeling old?
Nothing like fear of drowning to focus your attention.
They drive so recklessly there.
We can't leave it IN THERE, it's got all our accounts, everything that can NAIL us to a goddam CROSS!!!
Get out of here!
No, you can't.
Nothing is wrong. Everything is the way it has to be. In my left coat pocket is a packet. Passports, hotel reservations, tickets.
Both sides of the street, I'm afraid.
You should know, when I come back here with the Mask--if anything goes wrong, a detailed description of everything you've done goes to the PRC.
Tomorrow. It has to be tomorrow. Or forget the Mask.
Had to get a liquid plasma screen.
You're not the one trying to get all this shit. You think they've just got a Crooks R Us on every corner?
Inconvenient is trying to find a pulsing laser with magic arms in two days.
This is big enough.
You're impressed with her, aren't you?
You got a real problem with priorities, you know that?
We wear so many goddam masks after a while they get stuck to our faces, you know? And they don't come off. But when you find the one person who really knows you, and then you lose her...
What the fuck did you do with my stuff?
I understand they've had a bad run of luck, health-wise, and they have my sympathies. But that's not PG&E's fault.
Carlos isn't a friend; he's a client.
It's those files you asked for.
It's an inflammation of the spinal cord and part of the brain.
Well it oughta be, with all the work I put into it.
It was right up on the PG&E property over there.
Well, then -- if you're feeling up to it, maybe we should talk shop.
It's enough -- for whatever you need, for whatever your girls need, for whatever your girls' girls need -- it'll be enough.
Any school you want.
If you hadn't used profanity --
I told you the questions might get a little personal --
You did?  Wow, sorry about that.  Listen, Mario's a little not so bright.  He seems to think that you said --
I guess I'm not the right kind.
I left a message.  I've been dealing with that real estate thing.  I was gonna write up a whole damn report and --
Don't bother.
I got an interesting call this afternoon. It was from a Dr. Frankel.
You wanna know, you gotta hire me back.  I got a lot of bills to pay.
It doesn't take a genius to look at those medical records and think something's wrong.
So you think we got 'em scared?
What, you think I'm made of money?
-- It's about being realistic.  Something like this, Erin -- it could take forever. They're a huge corporation.  They'd completely bury us in paperwork.  I'm just one guy with a shitty little P.I. firm.
Oh, you do?  With all your legal expertise, you believe that?
Four more.  Eleven people.  So far.
Well -- I found one document at the water board that had a toxic test well reading from 1967.  A hell of a lot of people have lived on that land since then.
We've got the PG&E fuckers in Hinkley by the balls.  But nobody's getting rich unless we can pin this on the corporate PG&E fuckers in San Francisco.
PG&E corporate is claiming they had no way of knowing what was going on in Hinkley.
Show me the document that proves that.
Really?  It makes me sick.
D'you get his name?  Course not.  Jesus, Ed --
I'm thinking ... I wish someone else had to make this decision.  50 thousand bucks is more than any other California toxic plaintiff has gotten. Ever.  But ...
And it's less than pocket change for PG&E.
It's PG&E saying to the judge that we don't have a case.  Their lawyers go --
Bullshit.  It was a misunderstanding.  But instead of handling it politely, instead of treating her with respect --
Erin, it's just a meeting.
And, what, I'm not serious?
Tuesday at seven, at the Hinkley firehouse.
Say you'd be the luckiest son of a bitch on Earth if I didn't up and quit over all this.
Okay, fine.  <u>Fine</u>  You backed me into a corner again.  You're holding me hostage ...
Yesterday.
Sixty-nine.  We've got good answers to all of 'em.
Sweetheart, you can get a whole big bunch.
Oh, come on, where's your sense of adventure?  We're going someplace you never been before.
I'm a slow reader, on account of the fact that I look at the word "dog" and see "god".
You never fall short for the work people.  I guess maybe you just love them more.
Yeah, we had them couriered over.  And listen, good work.  They're a great start. We're just going to have to spend a little time filling in the holes in your research.
I do.
Why not?
No I'm not.  Look at me.  I'm not.
One toy per kid is doing something nice. Four is ... something else.
No, see -- that's exactly what those arrogant PG&E fucks want me to think -- that because they got all this money and power, we don't stand a chance in hell against them.  But you know what?  They're wrong.
Nothing.
Well, come to think of it, we did have a big event around here.  Beth started talking.
Cause it's my office party.  If you had an office, I'd go to your party.
That is not what I'm --
Fine.  I'll drop 'em off tomorrow afternoon.
Hi.  It's me.  I got a favor to ask you.
Yeah, well -- good help is hard to find.
Real early.  We're just gonna take your car to get some breakfast.
I moved payroll onto the computer.  It only knows to process paychecks for employees who log on in the morning and off at night.
It sure could, yeah.  Thanks a lot.
I'm surprised Donna didn't say anything.
I know.  But it's good for me.  Now I can help my daughter take care of my grandkids. And it's good for you, too.  Now you have money, you can find a good babysitter, huh? Not the old lady next door.
He did, didn't he?  <u>Baxter</u>!
No one put me up to anything.  I was just hoping I could ask you a couple questions.
Right, I guess those are the kids --
And code the signal to my private chamber.
Come in, Admiral.
Asteroids don't concern me, Admiral. I want that ship, not excuses.  How long until you can have Skywalker and the others in the Millennium Falcon before me?
Alert all commands.  Calculate every possible destination along their last known trajectory and disburse the fleet to search for them.  Don't fail me again, Admiral, I've had quite enough!
We've come this far ... He is our only hope.
Strong is Vader.  Clouded is your fate.  Mind what you have learned ... Notice everything, everything!  It can save you.
Everyone's invited, of course.
Okay, okay.
Not now, Chewie.  Lando, aren't you afraid the Empire might discover this little operation and shut you down?
No, I'm alright.  I'm alright.
Howls.
Barks his agreement.
Help you I can ... yes ... yes.
You know the Jedi Master?
It's the Jedi's time to eat, too.
Oh, your father ... a powerful Jedi was he, powerful Jedi.
There is a grave disturbance in The Force.
The son of Skywalker.  You must destroy him ... or he will be our undoing.
Wait.  I'll send a patrol with you.
What is it?
Go tell your precious Princess ... Luke is dead unless he shows up soon.
The energy shield is down.  We'll be stuck here forever.
Sir, I'm almost afraid to ask, but does shutting down all but emergency power systems include me?
I'm going to see what it is.
Not collapsing, honey.  It's closing!  This is no cave ...
Good.  Soon as we're clear, we'll kick this baby into hyperdrive.
You said you were going to stay. What happened?
I'd just as soon kiss a wookiee.
We are fighting for a cause much ...
And you think you're the one to apply some heat?
Forget it.
Who's scruffy-looking?  I tell ya' sweetheart, I must've hit pretty close to the mark to get you hoppin' like this.  Doesn't it look that way to you, Luke?
Don't worry, your holiness, I'll get her started.
Two more Star Destroyers heading right at us.
To get killed ... you're not seriously going into an asteroid field?
Good.
Now you're making sense.
What is it?
How do I look?
Would you please stop calling me that?
Strap yourself in, sweetheart, we're taking off!
Here ... near the Anoat system.
A mining colony.
Something's wrong here.  Your friend Lando is very charming, but I don't trust him.
Look, sweetheart, I'm not going to have you accusing my friend of ...
I've finished my circle and I haven't picked up any life read- ings.
Hyperdrive.
I'm sorry too.
You will find them well enough. But they must never again leave this city.
Not really.
Yes, we keep pollution down by having the power reactor far below the city.  It's connected by a transfer shaft.
I'm coming over to your side, that's what.  And I have a feeling I'm making a big mistake.
You've probably never done an honorable thing in your life.
What chance have we got in here? What are we going to do when they cut ...
Don't worry about a thing.  I'll get us going.
I didn't say anything?
Wait a minute.  We're not going back there.
That sounds familiar.
What is it?
So much has happened during the period of your indisposition, sir.
Well, what now?
What are you talking about?
I could get more loyalty if I went down the hall and recruited some of those snow creatures.
You are reckless!
I thought those seekers were set for stun!
Only what you take with you.
It is the future you see.
If it must be.  Yes.
You'll find I'm full of surprises.
Time will tell.
Anything on the Millennium Falcon?
There was a sort of carpetbag in the ship.
They look pretty docile.
He's a gorilla.
Heavy Third World connections. They get weapons, drugs, fuel, choppers - everything is pumped into the island from the south.
Plissken, slow down the sub. You're overloading the power plant.
Go on now. Do as I say.
You're my woman, you understand? You don't let anybody take you away from me without a fight.
Where?
I got a new deal for you.
We get the girl and the prototype. And we get out.
I don't know yet.
My name is no longer Carjack. Will you please get that through your fucking head?
What's the little black box do?
There's a war about to be declared, or didn't you know?
Hands on switches and counting. 5...4...3...2...1. Launch.
Does he know how to activate it?
Looking to get out.
Are you crazy?
The Surgeon General of Beverly Hills.
You need help.
How the hell am I supposed to know? This is your damn city.
What the hell is this?
Find Cuervo Jones.
Who?
...Perceval!
...I saw nothing.
So be it, to the death.
Then make me your champion and I will always fight in your place.
Only give me leave to ride out again, to do what I am most able to do, and happiest doing.
But one can still keep a sword sharp riding out in the name of the King's law.
It is deep...
You are that and much more. You are its greatest knight, you are what is best in men. Now we will be together--
Don't recognize him. You were trapped by Morgana's sorcery.
Speak of the devil!...
But not from your destiny.
That's not why you came.
'Help me, Help me.' Help me get up.
In the great book.
The dragon! There...
There are maidens as fair, and fairer than Guenevere. If I put my mind to it, I could see them now, many of them, weeping for love of you, watching the hills for you coming from the high towers of their castles. Offering you their every favor. Rich, clever--but if it is to be Guenevere, so be it.
Guenevere. And a beloved friend who will betray you.
The Lady of the Lake. Take it. Take it, quickly!
...to ride out and meet them.
Then answer me this. For years peace has reigned in the land. Crops grow in abundance, there is no want. Every one of my subjects enjoys his portion of happiness and justice, even those whose tiresome misunderstandings we must resolve here each day. Tell me, Merlin: have we defeated evil, as it seems?
What is it my child?
Just yes? No mad laughter, no riddles, nothing but a simple yes? That frightens me.
I didn't ask for poetry. Which is it?
My powers fade, Arthur. I resort to cheap tricks...  Yes! I enjoy every moment of my foolishness, I join in the making of it, so no one can betray me. But you! You betray yourself.
Rise, Mordred.
I recognize you only as my son, no more.
Your mother told you that?
And I offer only this, Father. To commit with passion and pleasure all the evils that you failed to commit, as man and king.
I don't know. Merlin brought you to me when you were newly born and charged me to raise you as my own. At first, I did so because I feared Merlin, later because I loved you.
The laws, my laws, must bind everyone, high and low, or they are not laws at all. Lancelot will come...
You and the land are one. Drink from the chalice. You will be reborn and the land with you.
I am a fighting man and I am married to the quest. That is enough.
You.
Yes. I would swear my love to you.
He has given up.
We are to blame.
You're a man?!  ...with metal skin!
--It must wait, child. These good ladies, for whom I intervened once, will honor me with a meal. I am beholden to them now as I was when they begged my protection.
I'm not jealous!
Shh... yes, yes. Sit with me, please... Morgana.
Why?
I won't. You would misuse such power. I have paid enough for you, and I will have you.
What's behind that beauty? A wizened, cold-hearted snake.
I am the desert, where water disappears--
Don't you think he's too old, though? How's his health?
I didn't know that.
You're sorry. Christ, eighty-eight doctors and all you can tell me is all of your bullshit...
What's this?
Why don't you let me?
Well, when I went to get the Thorazine I had him to stay with her and... Oh, I should of known better.
Of course I didn't.
Me too.
You're a nice man.
Good morning Karl. Oh Karl, we've got rats in the attic you better get some traps.
Yes, I go now.
No rats. Thanks a lot that's terrific.
What!
Fine thank you.
What is it? A tranquilizer?
Wait a minute. What are you talking about?
Well, specifically, Mrs. MacNeil, she advised me to keep my fingers away from her goddam cunt.
Oh no, that was no spasm. I got on the bed, the whole bed was thumping and rising off the floor and shaking. The whole thing, with me on it!
Lesion, Lesion in the temperal lobe. It's a kind of seizure disorder.
The temperal lobe is very common. Could last for days, even weeks. It isn't rare to find destructive or even criminal behaviour.
What was going on in there, how could she jump off the bed like that?
Yes am.
No.
The priest.
You could do it yourself...
Not a psychiatrist! She needs a priest! She's already seen every fucking psychiatrist in the world and they sent me to you, now you're gonna send me back to them! Jesus Christ, won't somebody help her!
Oh, will you help her! Just help her!
No.
Please.
What's the difference?
Oh............
You like it?
Here I'll show you.
No I do, Captain Howdy said no.
Captain Howdy.
Here I'll show you.
I don't know
You can bring Mr. Dennings if you like.
You like him.
But you like him.
Well I heard differently.
I don't know, I just thought.
How do you know?
My bed was shaking, I can't get to sleep.
Honey it's to help you.
Okay.
So what's wrong with her?
Oh, Christ.
I stole it.
Are you gonna steal my shoes now?
Stealing is a sin.
How's the girl?
In time. But mirabile dictu, don't you agree?
Bon Jour.
Holy water.
No.
And let my cry come unto thee.
Defender of the human race...
Her heart.
She'll go into coma.
I've seen him.
Very much.
Be silent!
Fuck him!!!
Do you have an appointment?
Sometimes.
I don't know.
Take it now.
Baker.
Teeth.
How many?
No bones?
Two at a time?
Go fuck yourself.
I thought maybe held gotten over that.
Yes, yes.  It's just that John is so much nicer. Jack sounds so ... crude. When I was a little girl, we had a pig on the farm named Jack. I guess I just can't help making the association.
In the attic.  Behind some of Dad's stuff.  Look, Jack can hardly reach the pedals.
My pleasure.
Frank.  I'm here.  I always get here.  Don't sweat it.
Who's gonna make trouble?  Hey, amigo!
Huh?
I hate your kids, Frank.
No thanks.
Nothing.  Everything's great. Terrific.
I don't know what you mean.
No.
Talk.
Let's get it over with.
I was just thinking what Ma would think.
I'll drop the eighths.
Come on, stand still.
It's not gonna hurt you.
How about these?
That's it except for the first. We got the Sheraton, the Ambassador, or the Holiday Inn on Sixtieth.  All three-day turns.
Yeah, fine.
First night?
Yeah.
Yeah.  You mind?
I don't know.  I mean, I always did it as a kid. I figured it was no big deal.  Is it?  A big deal?
No, that's your problem, Frank.  You get around one of these assholes and you turn into a fucking three-year-old.
Right.  I love you, Frank.
I'm sorry, Frank.  All that talk about family. I just got emotional.
What's it look like I'm doing? I'm tuning a goddamn piano.
Half-hour.  Once I finish this octave I'm gonna get breakfast.  You see what's on the buffet?
Two hours ago!
What the hell are these?
What?
What are you talking about?
No, you're wrong.  It's just beginning. Come on, have a drink. Show your big brother how it's done.
It was just a can of beer, Frank.
You're making things up, Frank.
I can't make the tenth.
I mean maybe you should check with us before you go off and book us a month in advance.
You want to know how much I got tied up in deposits with Willie?  We're in for three weeks solid, Jack.
I told you, Jack.  It's a telethon. No one gets a cent.
We're playing for a goddamn gymnasium!
Shut up, Frank.
Look.  I didn't know when we were going to be on until yesterday.  What was I supposed to do? I had the pianos anyway.
What're you doing?
Later.
There's not going to be a viewing. I figured with the kids and all ...
No.
No, it's not that.  I ... can't drink from the bottle.  I ... gag.
Yeah, I know.  Me, too.
All right.
Doctor's orders.
I'm sorry?
Well, that's fine --
Right.
Uh-huh.  Well, Miss Moran, what is it you'd like to do for us?
This is where the auditions were.
We're finished.
Look, miss.  We're tired, you have gum on your lip, and we're going home.
You're an hour and a half late.
We ran long.
Uh ... Frank Baker.  This is my brother.
Changed?
All right, but make it quick.  Shoes!  What size do you wear?
Nine?
Big feet.
They're nines.
Don't worry.  We'll take it out of your share.
Piece of cake.
Switch?  What fucking switch?
I said I was sorry.
Hey.
Baker's unabridged.
Virgins.
Great.
As Charlie Steinway is my witness.
Jack woke up on the wrong side of the bottle.
Uh, well ...
I'll call you.
Born and bred.
We trust you, Lloyd.  You know that.
So. I'm here, you're here, the piano's here.  What d'ya say?
Come on, Ed.
The name's Baker --
I'm tired.  Really.  I should get home.
For a while.  She left.
The Stratford.
Huh?
I mean, that'd be too creepy. With us working together and all.
Every year.
It means you wouldn't know good if it came up and fucked you.
Ed? How many people live here?
You don't pick your brother.
I saw his stuff in the bathroom.
Fine.  You?
They don't give two fucks about your health.  The Clinic's where they send the real hard-cases for attitude adjustment.  Look at O'Neill --
... Thanks.
Yeah -- me.
My place.
Better than you bleeding all over my car upholstery. Trust me, Caz, you won't be here long.
Shut up.
Retching and convulsing while those bastards didn't even try to save her sorry ass.  You gave her mouth to mouth -- man -- even then you had some constitution.
Everything I say is wrong. I can't talk to her anymore.
Must've been after we got engaged.
Never mind that!  Just take Jamie and get out of that house.  Don't tell anyone where you're going -- especially not him -- just GO.
Think about it, Eve! Everything he's done recently has been peculiar, right?  He's said and done things your husband would never do ...
Don't hang up ...
Apparently, fine.  He's coming into work.  That's the good news ...
The left, I think.  Those surgeons in Witness Protection can fix things nobody's even broken yet.
Call Lazarro.  Castor just came out of his coma.
I've been working night and day.  I haven't had time.
And how much will your "fun" net you this time?
Mention my family once more and you're dead.
Let's not confuse things anymore.  I'm Archer. You're Castor.  But if you need proof --
Too late, your kid worships me.  And your wife -- she's an animal.  Even I can't keep up with her.
I'm going to have you fired.
Walton, you have to let me see the warden --
Janie?
Let's try to be a little less formal from now on, shall we?
Get rid of them.
What the fuck do you think happened?  Castor Troy just shot him!  What are you waiting for?  GO!
Don't I usually kiss my wife?
Gone?
Can't you see I'm trying to change?  I sent Jamie off because I wanted to be alone with you.  I wanted to see the candle-light dance in your beautiful --
So you see, I'm not going anywhere.  Unless it's upstairs with you ...
Great.
Good.  Because I'm fed up.
You?  Married?
Excuse me?
Stop Jack, I'm getting all weepy.
No?!  You almost married this woman.  Aren't you even curious what she wants?
Because my gift comes with ten zeroes at the end...
Uh huh. The retail end, I understand.
Seven.  Really.
I’m not worried, Mom. He’s still learning our ways...
Where’s my real dad?
Five thirty.  Okay.
Don’t you think that’s a little gimmicky?
Mary Had A Little Lamb.
No, honey. Go back to sleep.
Kate’s my wife...
She wants to have an affair with me.
It wouldn’t really be cheating...  It’s complicated.
I’m telling you, those rules don’t apply to me, Arn.
Hey, is that really necessary?
The Caddy?  Why don’t you take your own damn car!
I call all you white guys "Jack."
There's no way I was gonna die in that deli...  Let's just say I've been on a lucky streak lately.
I don't do that.  That's just not for me...
Wait a minute, wait a minute... you're tryin' to save me?
I've got everything I need.
I glimpse?  A glimpse of what!?  What glimpse?! Glimpse!
Why not?
You first generation, xenophobic, money-theistic, hot pastrami sandwich making...
Maybe you’re not hearing me.  I am Jack Campbell...  Right here.  Jack Campbell, President...
Just until the Deutsche Mark turns...
All in one tape?
About the plane? What do you think it’s gonna crash? Don’t say that...
For us, Kate.
No, you’re right.  What are we doing?
Yeah...fine.
I was in the city.
Party?  Oh no, I can’t go to a party...
Because you’ll be here.
No, she’s not.
But it’s twenty degrees outside...
And...?
Well that’s just great...those little monkeys can be a real handful...
I thought we had a deal about you watching CNBC in bed.
It’s ten thirty, Jack. By eleven you’re gonna be sprawled out on the bed snoring your head off. We don’t have time for wining and dining.
It’s an unbelievable thing.  Wearing this suit actually makes me feel like a better person.  I’m gonna buy it...
You had a heart attack?
If you want to look at it that way...
Zeena...
Enjoy it, sweetheart...
What are you talking about?  You never wait all day.  You can barely wait until it’s light out.
It’s like a museum.
What are you talking about, Jack?
This is New York City, it’s like the needy people capital of the world.  Those Jersey clients of yours aren’t a tenth as pathetic as the ones you could get here...
No, this is the center of the universe.  If I were living in Roman times, I would live in Rome, where else?  Today, America is the Roman Empire and New York is Rome itself. John Lennon.
But I’ve done some good things too, haven’t I?
Are you okay, Jack?
I’m moving to Paris...it was right here...  It’s a box marked “Jack.”  I put it in the stack for the Salvation Army...
No, Jack, I never got married. You?
Jesus, Jack...
Jack.
We have two kids, Annie and Josh...
Where is he?
Then leave it in the past. Old flames are like old tax returns.  You keep `em in the file cabinet for three years and then you cut `em loose.
Do I know you?
You’re a little tougher, Peter.
Okay, I’ll take them...
Jersey?  You know what the traffic's gonna be like?
Hey, kind of under a little pressure here.
Maybe it’s by the wardrobe boxes...
Congratulations. The La Guardia flight’s canceled but I got you out of Kennedy on United at nine. Am I good or what?
Trust me, this ain't one of those times.
Relax, it's casual.
This wasn't our first stop, in case you forgot NASA.  And Victor's not that bad.  He's just a little...  Larger than life.
Youthful high spirits.
I'm sure he's matured since then.
<u>Should</u>?
This isn't permanent, Johnny.  We need to be careful until we're normal again.
Yeah.  I can tell.  Victor was right.
Keep talking, there won't <u>be</u> a next time.
'Course not.  Strictly business.
Back on Earth.  Victor's medical facility... We're in quarantine.
They're fine.  Everybody <i>else</i>...is fine.
Go back to the drawing board.
I'll schedule the launch.  Call me in the morning to talk about resources and crew.
Like the shields Reed said would protect us.  How long?
I can go hotter!
Last one down springs for room service.
You were at 4000 Kelvin.  Any hotter, you're approaching supernova --
Blockhead started it!
History, Leonard.  <u>History</u>. Everything else is conversation...  How's the other matter?
Sir, I'm sure he wouldn't put himself --
Actually, uh, people seem to think the scar "humanizes" you.
Yes sir.  You've got the Mayor at eight, then a nine-thirty interview with the Journal --
You remember in school we talked about working together.  That's what I was about to explain...
The number's <u>seventy-five</u>.  And it's applications <u>and</u> patents.
Get a grip.  Reed.  We didn't come all this way to lose our nerve at the first little glitch.  Just close the shields...
It's too late for him, and soon it'll be too late for all of us.
Not much.  We need to run tests to see the extent of the damage.
<u>I</u> ruined?  With all due respect, I told you to abort --
I was talking about us.  Working together.
Yes, thanks.
You are such a dork, Reed... You never got it and never will unless it's explained to you in quantum physics.
What?  What do you mean you --
That's what we're here to find out.
What in the world would give me that idea?
And reverse the mutations --
With the right energy, we can stabilize the storm.  Maybe tie into the city grid...
No way to know.  Without more tests, experiments.
I understand the <i>business</i> reasons.
Right, of course, the company... But you see, I've come to realize all the accomplishments in the world mean nothing without someone to share them with --
Raising the shields.
I told you, I'm fine.  It's <u>you</u> I'm worried about.
Same old Reed.  All analysis, no action.  Wasn't that the problem with you two?
Oh, I think you already have.
I know it can't be easy.  Life hasn't changed that much for Reed, Sue and Johnny.  At least they can go out in public.  But for you?  People staring. Whispering behind your back...
That would give us only three seconds to revive him...
Message to Proteus.
They'll make up some time, once they get through that and reach the Pleural Cavity.  Respiration Post...
I can't help it. I'm just weak, I guess.
That blip we're picking up might only be the radio-active particle. The Proteus may already be destroyed...
Tell him where he fits in, will you? I've got a few things to check out.
As part of the Crew.
Grant, our Miniaturizer can shrink anything.
Yes, Cora.
No danger of an embolism. At our reduced scale, they're much too minute to prove fatal to Benes.
I don't know yet, Doctor. And I won't know until I test it.
We're pushing oxygen today.
You sound as if you're not looking forward to it.
I think it's the most exciting --  We're going to see things no one ever saw before. The actual physical process of Life itself -- not something under a microscope... Just think of it --
I've been with him since I got out of school. He brought me into the CMDF, over five years ago.
But I did. I'm positive!
Not anything built into the chassis.  If it hadn't come loose --
What about Dr. Michaels?
A forced joining of an Artery and Vein. Must've happened when Benes was hurt.
I'm afraid there's only one thing we can do. Call off the mission.
If there's any chance --
That line was tampered with...
No, we should reach the base of the Brain shortly. And from there, it's not far to the site of the injury.
Why not? Because of his gibberish about GOd and the Soul? Camouflage -- that's all it is -- to blind the gullible like you! And to hide his real identity -- a fanatic whose only purpose is to kill Benes! And you made it possible!
I thought I was on my vacation... What's it all about?
It should work -- theoretically. If it doesn't, the mission's off. The craft's nuclear-powered. Except for your wireless.
Remember -- we can't take more than five minutes to get out.
Look at those Walls up ahead!
We're entering a Capillary. Remain in the middle.
It's less than one ten-thousandth of an inch thick. And porous.
What do you mean?
Yeah, I just came in. I decided not to park here.
I just pulled in here. I just fucking pulled in here!
I don't know. Few munce.
I'm fuckin' hungry now, you know.
Whoa, Daddy.
We split that.
The new vehicle, plus forty thousand dollars.
Yeah, you already said that.
Well, that's, that's, I'm not go inta, inta - see, I just need money. Now, her dad's real wealthy -
Personal matters.
What the heck d'ya mean?
The heck d'ya mean? What a you guys got yourself mixed up in?
Well, I'm sorry, but I just - I -
Don't you fucking but me, Jerry.  I want you with this money on the Dayton- Radisson parking ramp, top level, thirty minutes, and we'll wrap this up.
GOT IT?
Well, okay, I'll talk to my boss...
One hundred! You lied to me, Mr. Lundegaard. You're a bald-faced liar!
White Bear Lake?
What'd this guy look like anyways?
Uh-huh - in what way?
Okay, well, thanks a bunch, Mr. Mohra. You're right, it's probably nothin', but thanks for callin' her in.
In what way?
Yeah!
Hold on.
Jerry, we're not just going to give you seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
They're playin' the Buckeyes!
What if - what if sumpn goes wrong?
Huh? Yah?
I unnerstand. I'll keep it real short, then. I'm on my way out of town, but I was just - Do you mind if I sit down? I'm carrying a bit of a load here.
Yeah, but the vehicles you were borrowing on, I just can't read the serial numbers on your application. Maybe if you could just read them to me -
No, fax is no good, that's what I have and I can't read the darn thing -
All right, Jerry, you got this phone to yourself?
Know who this is?
Circumstances have changed, Jerry.
My patience is at an end.
It's okay, Scotty.
Ya got the car?
Yah, okay.
You told me about it.
Yah.
No, but, Wade, see, I was bringin' you this deal for you to loan me the money to put in. It's my deal here, see?
Put you in touch with Grimsrud.
Well, I don't vouch for him.
I'm fine - it's just morning sickness.
Oh, yah?
Well, he's got his gun on his hip there, and he looks like a nice enough guy. It's a real shame.
You haven't monkeyed with his car there, have ya?
Yah, I think that vehicle there probly had dealer plates. DLR?
Yah. Say, Lou, ya hear the one about the guy who couldn't afford personalized plates, so he went and changed his name to J2L 4685?
That's okay, hon. I gotta run.
Aw, Norm.
Yah... Yah, yah. Geeze, Margie!
Yah - easy there - you do too!  I'm expecting, ya know.
Great. What brings ya down - are ya down here on that homicide - if you're allowed, ya know, to discuss that?
Well, they're a good outfit.
No, I didn't...
It's okay...
Well, you do reside their at 1425 Fremont Terrace?
Margie Olmstead?
What'd he say?
Yah, Linda's fine. You should call her.
Yah. Where are ya, Margie?
Uh-huh.
Yah, not too bad. So it's nice up there?
Yah.
Well, they're all out on the wire. Well, you know...
Congratulations, Jerry.
Where's Tyler?
Right, right.
I'm not disclosed to bespeak any such information to you, nor would I, even if I had said information you want, at this juncture be able.
We're still men.
Six months ago, Bob's testicles were removed.  Then hormone therapy.  He developed bitch tits because his testosterone was too high and his body upped the estrogen.  That was where my head fit -- into his huge, sweating tits that hung enormous, the way we think of God's as big.
Bob, Bob... I'm a member.
Look at my face.
You need to make these your primary "action items."
"The second rule of fight club... Is this yours?
Really?
I don't know -- am I?
You can't have both parasites.  You can take blood parasites --
You can't have the whole brain!
Should we?
The forwarding number.  I haven't seen you at any support groups.
You haven't been going to yours.
Like testicular cancer?
Me too.  I got a stomach full of Xanax.  I took what was left of a bottle.  Might've been too much.
I got this dress at a thrift store for one dollar.
Good.
Here.
Okay.  Okay, I'm sure.
Nothing.
That day you came over to my place to play doctor... what was going on there?
What?
Answer the question!
Your whacked-out, bald freaks hit me with a fucking broom.  I thought they were going to break my arm.
Here comes an avalanche of bullshit.
Give me a minute, Marla, alright... just sixty seconds.
No, no, shut up!  I've had enough. I tried, Tyler... I have tried...
I can't let myself see where you're going.  Go wherever it takes you, remember... keep away from major cities...
Yes.
Who's this?
You fucking slut!!
Yes... it's a test.
Look what we've accomplised.  Thirty seconds.
Delivered from Swedish furniture.
The things you own, they end up owning you.
We're on our third pitcher of beer. Just ask me.
It's called a "changeover."  The movie goes on, and nobody in the audience has any idea.
It affords him other interesting opportunities.
This is crazy.
Call what off?
What fight?
Abe Lincoln.  Big reach.  Skinny guys fight till they're burger.
Marla doesn't need a lover.  She needs a case worker.
Yes, I promise.
Don't mention me.
It isn't... ?
We don't... ?
Nothing.  Do what you like.
I heard.  Local 15, Monday nights.
Hey.
I felt like destroying something beautiful.
What should I have told you?
What are you doing?!
If the applicant is young, we tell him he's too young.  Old, too old. Fat, too fat.
What... ?
This isn't possible...
I can't let you...
I'm not going...
Don't pull the green wire.  Pull anything but the green wire.
Fuck your struggle.  I want out.
Defuse the bomb, please.
Fuck that, maybe you're my hallucination.
Why what?
... no, no, no...
What have you left for me?
Not my mouth.  Our mouth.
Maintenance.
Very good, Sir.
What he wanted?  Look... look at him. Look at him!  What does he want?  This is a person.  This is not a cog in your machine...
We have a deal worked out with Irvine.
Pleeeeeease!
We need some towels, Lou.  We need replacement light bulbs.
Yesssss...
Yeah ... animals and s-s-s ---
Congratufuckinglations.  That makes you last to go.  But don't worry, once the others are dead, it'll come back for you.  Always does.
The songs on the radio.  But wait.  I don't understand.  Why is this even happening to me?
Then it wasn't just a sign. It was a premonition?
We need to hurry.
Yeah, you should have specified.
Yeah.  Who does he think he is? Knight Rider?
Blow me.  Yellow means go, Kimmy.
Does she have a cell phone?  A way we can contact her?
Alright miss, calm down.  I just need this lane open.  I need you to pull your vehicle onto the shoulder!
Like I said, it was like I was there. I remember everything.  The sounds of the crashes, the smells, the look on Shaina's face...
...My Premonition was just like his.
Evan Shaeffer's dead.
Then you believe all this??  That Death is working off a list?
Clean up?  I don't...
Hold on.
It sounds all well and good, but what if we're wrong?
How are we going to find her?  There must be thousands of white vans in this state.
He can't breathe damn it.  I think his lung's collapsed!
I know.  I can feel it too.
Get ready to smile, five guys per girl.
There's going to be a huge accident! Everyone's gonna die.  All of us!  I saw it!
There's going to be a huge accident! Everyone's gonna die, all of us, I saw it!
I don't know what's weirder, the dialing a wrong number part or that Death would set you up nine months in advance.
Sure.
I love you too, Dad.  Goodnight.
I used to have those feelings, too. But that's when I'd think of Mom. Her strength...and courage.  And I'd pray that maybe I'd grow up to be as brave as she was.  And the bad thoughts would go away.
What if Tod... is just the first... of us?
I don't know. I wish I could just see him... one more time, then, maybe...  I would know.
That's total bullshit. You can find death omens anywhere you want to.
No! No! Don't!
I wish you were on the plane!
Look, there's something you should all know.
You're the fuckin' devil.
"Intervention?" What are you, God now?!
Dude, get wisdom. We're about to board a seven hour flight. The toilets in coach are barely ventilated closets. What if your body wants that airplane food out of your system and you have to go torque a wicked cable and then right after you walks in Christa or Blake?  You want them to associate with you with that reflexive gag and the watery sting in their eyes?
C'mon, man, like you really thought you were gonna tittie fuck 'em over Greenland, or something?
Design?
Me, right? That's why you're not saying.
No one's that strong.
Terry's name should be on this wall.
May as well go out under my own free will, right?
I'm not afraid! I DECIDE WHEN IT'S TIME! I control my life! I control my death!
WE DON'T NEED THIS NOW!
You break your leg, I'll have to shoot you.
Modified M-16 A2 and over-under M-79 grenade launcher, with Sionics sound suppressor, Tracor starlight scope and LAC/R-100 Laser sighting system.
This is state-of-the-art firepower.
Where's your stuff?
Let me see.
Alright.  Home run.
What?  Are you crazy?  We're supposed to take pictures and split. You're gonna blow the whole program.
It's a Soviet MIL MI-24.  Probably has 12.7mm nose cannon, heat-seeking rockets and wire guided missiles, plus...
How much we got left in that minigun?
I have arranged transportation.  We meet soon.  But I think you to be disappointed.
Spooks?
They heard about escaped prisoner on radio.  Make deal.  More than we pay.
You think you are... .
How you going to get there?  You can't trust the spooks to pull you out.  They'll use you up and throw you away.
How?
Minigun.  Come on.  Let's move. He's coming in on our open side.
Classic special forces op... hit fast... in and out.  Two men.  Two days.
Not yet.
Sir, there's something else... a TRANSAT relay.  Just came through.
POWs?  I don't know.  But either way it'll get that subcommittee off our necks.  Cream?
Look, Colonel... we're all adults here.  This is a war.  A very quiet, very intense war.  People get sacrificed.
You think I'm some whacko?  I like to hurt people?  I'm doing a job here.  If I knew what's right or wrong I'd be a goddamned priest, right?  So I follow directives... I do what I'm told.  It's simple.  If your boy had done what he was told, there wouldn't be a problem.
That's a crock.  We don't say that. Do you have any idea the shitstorm if he'd gotten back with that guy? If it went public?  The White House would have to act through channels. We're talking ransom.  Four billion bucks in war reparations to Vietnam to get the others back.  That's billion, Colonel.  With a "B".  For a few guys that've had their brains in a blender for ten years?  A pain in the ass to everybody?  No way. There's no way.
It's not over.  You made one mistake.
American.  Come to get you out.
Colonel.
Well, there's nobody special!
I mean, it's not easy in this day and age.
Meeting ... people.
Got any more bread crust?
<u>What are you, out of your mind</u>!
Huh...the restaurant's just around the corner here...
Yeah, well... suicidal paranoiacs say funny things sometimes.
I was attacked.
Okay.  ... I love you...
What?  The curse'll be lifted?  <u>Will</u> <u>you please</u>!
What does that mean?
Thank you very much.
Well...I think you should feel very proud. You did a real nice thing for somebody else. I'm very proud.
All right... I'll pack my stuff tonight.
I'm afraid not ... Then again, I'm not sure. The beating's bad but it's not the problem... It seems he's.. re-experiencing the catatonia... So, like before, he could snap out it in an hour or in thirteen months or thirteen years... ....I don't know. There's no way to tell.
She gave you the old brusheroo, kiddo... Believe me -- this tart will never make it to your desert plate...
Uh... basement I think...
I'm... just looking for Parry...
Well,... I'm a singer by trade... Summer stock...nightclub revues... that kind of thing...It used to be what I absolutely lived for...God...I can do GYPSY backwards - every part- but, one night...in the middle of singing "Funny..... - it suddenly hit me... ...what does all of this really mean?  That, and the fact that all my friends are dead...God, I sound like a veteran. Dad would be so proud.
NO! I want a debutante on a horse to step on me.  Leave me alone!!
Yes... I... I agree...
You can ask.
Jack, it's a sitcom -- you're not defining Pi.
I was nine in the sixties.
Yes well...  You are a credit card holder, are you not?
Well -- were there a lot of people in the room or just you or what?
Well, I mean... I don't know you... This has never... I've never won anything and... I don't have a VCR.
Yes. Hi..Congratulations. Jack Lucas. Nice to meet you finally. This is Anne Napolitano, the owner of Video Spot.
Well..um...you get an official membership card...  Just sign that and we'll laminate it right here... Parry?  You want to laminate Miss Sinclair's card?...
Uh... you... you can pick out up to ten movies...
What girl?  I didn't notice.
Hahahahaaa... Nononono... Not yet... Hahahaha...
<u>What</u>!?
I'm the one what?
But I need help and <u>they</u> sent you.
Funny -- you look married.
Huh-huh. I'm deeply smitten.
Well, if every time someone did something offensive they hit in the head with a pebble, I think they might alter their behavior. What do you think Jack...
No. I think you're a moron and I don't want to get into trouble.
You're a true <u>friend</u>.
Who?
It's a classic.
Have you ever done any cloudbusting? You lie on your back and you concentrate on the clouds...and you try yo break them apart with your mind. It's wild.
Who are you talking to Jack?
Bingo!
Tch...how romantic. Yeah. If I wasn't already committed to Lydia, boy. Except Anne'd never go for me though. She loves you too much. And you really love her, huh?
No. Nothing bad's going to happen. Anne'll be there. I'll be there. Nothing bad will happen.
Yeah.....Hey they're moving....  Am I doing that?
BINGO! Tell the man what he's won!
No just Parry.
Got any Ethel Merman?
What a gyp.
And then we'll exchange phone numbers and you'll leave and never call and I'll go to work and feel great for the first hour and then slowly turn into a piece of dirt by lunch.  Why am I putting myself through this?  It was very nice... uh meeting you. Good night..
Divorced.
Okay. Go ahead. I'll settle up for the beers...  An' walk Rayette over with you, will you.
You said.
I'm too moved by your gentility to speak.
Serveza yourself!
No, I'm not mad at you, hand. It'll be all right. Just spot and follow through...
You're the pathetic one, not me.
You treat me like I was.
Is what you?
I don't know.
I can't talk to you right now, leave me alone...
Fill it up.
You're lucky no one was hurt.
Who?
I didn't get it, did I?
What does that mean? You don't have any tomatoes?
Would you like to talk to the manager?
Okay, I'll make it as easy for you as I can. Give me an omelette, plain, and a chicken salad sandwich on wheat toast -- no butter, no mayonnaise, no lettuce -- and a cup of coffee.
Yeah. I want you to hold it between your knees.
Well, I don't claim to have sold 'em all. They still have some left, I believe.
Don't, then.
You know who it once belonged to?
Waldnit von Schnechter. Prewar.
Who's Van Oost?
Don't tell me about this...
I'm going back up tonight. Will you go with me?
Yeah, me, too...
Tita, I've got to go...
No, I don't.  You should've left a long time ago.
Well, if you just maybe did something with your hair, or...
There's nothing to say, Tita...
I don't know.
No, thanks...
Bye, Robert.
What would I do with it? Run amok?
Then after that?
Well, at least you're accomplished at something...
No, you're very good at it. I'm really impressed.
That's right.
Is he?
I hope it will, yes.  I'm sorry.
Is she?
Thanks, Carl...
That's what I mean...
Well, you're a romantic, Catherine, as are most musicians, and what's more, about to be married...
A dispose-all, what's that but more crap? I've never seen such crap. Oofh, I don't know how people get up in the morning.
Yes.
Oh, for pity's sake...
Why you have an attitude for?
Is it true?
Then I want you to go to whoever's sayin' that and tell them to stop.
Hi.
Of course.
Just chill.
You look good.
I can't!
Yo, Carlos-I'm gonna punch you.
Yeah! Tell me which one you would like. To be doin' nothin on a fire escape or beat the pool with a bunch of girls? Be straight up!
Which one?
No, c'mon, stop playin'. The girl that you kissed when we got there. Where s he live at?
Yeah, he got a bad attitude.
Yeah.
Wha'?
Jus' from around the way.
He never leaves the beach, Fat Sam. Never leaves. Sits in that chair, he's outta junk. Then he suddenly gets up, he's got junk. So where does it come from? Through the sand?
I ought to get some sleep.
Nineteen.
They didn't do anything.
I see. And what do you do for a living, Mr. Fletch?
I'm about to break that beach wide open, and I don't need some pennyante Woodward and Bernstein getting in the way of my men.
You idiot. Off the record, deep background: I've got that beach crawling with undercover cops.
I said I'll take care of it. Now, a man of your position shouldn't be a part of what's about to go down. So go home and I'll call you tomorrow.
Well, I haven't played in a while because of these kidney pains.
That's Babar.
I'll bet. Shame about Ed.
Bend over and drop your pants, Mr. Babar.
Breathe easy...
I can't discuss another patient. You know that.  Well, I can't find anything wrong with you.
Tell the nurse when you've got a few free days. She'll make all the arrangements.
Okay. Some idea.
Like tonight.
Fletch...
You don't know me.
Where am I?
Well, I didn't want to say anything, but I thought the dead man was my brother.
Hey, shut up, okay? I just hate this.
This is no joke. If some kind of payment isn't made, we're going to have to contact the paper and garnish your wages.
Wait a second --
Whoops.
Harry S. Truman?
Isn't that nice. Good man. Showed the Japs a thing or two.
Come on in.
Velma.
Oh, about ten days ago.
What the hell does this have to do with insurance?
Hi Gummy. How’s the eye?
I've got fifty thousand dollars says you will.
Sometimes yes, sometimes no. The staff usually forgets.
Get me on the first shot, if you can.
Where am I going?
You sure got the hard part.
Not me.
No problem, boss.
I wonder if that's his doctor.
Yeah.
John! You used to fly together!
So were my parents.
I'm such a heel. How'd you guess?
Hi.
Well, I knew this is where my mouth would be.
Yes.
I saved his life during the war.
Your bone structure, shoulders, neck...
No.  I mean, 'no you can't ask me that.' I mean, ask me something else.
So, your husband hired me to kill him. That's the truth.
Stop it.  Are you saying my husband is defrauding me?
If you need me, call the paper. Hand me that extra bottle okay?
But first I called the Hall of Records in Provo. They checked on the deed. You're telling the truth. A minute later Alan came in the room and asked me why I was shaking.
I think you better sit down.
Gail, please.
I'm calling the police. Right now.
Cabana one.
Charged to the Underhills, sir?
Sierra del fuego.
I work for the landlord. He told me to watch out for the place.
Go ahead. Call them. Better tie your shoelaces first.
No it's not okay. You have to have this in by tomorrow. Did you see the ad we ran Sunday?
I'd say charcoal.
Utah?
Who? Donnie and Marie?
Go to transportation, get a ticket.
Get out of here.
But not unsubstantiated charges about dope-dealing cops, and not horse shit paranoid fantasies about homicidal police chiefs.
John!
I'd appreciate an opportunity to discuss this with you.
In a minute!
But I ain't got you...
Mr. Fairlane, I'm very rich.  The kind of rich that warps minds. Nothing offends me.  When I was eleven, I walked in on my father and the Shetland pony he had given me for my tenth birthday. Does that excite you?
Yeah, but of course for now, I only get a twenty.
Who?
Thanks, I needed that.
I guess I'm not interested in any club who'll have my member as a member.  Later, Don...
I love you, too, baby.  He wants to meet at six.  What time is it now?
Ah -- ha... You know, you should think about dating Earthmen again.
Shut up, goodies from the ice queen.
No, as a matter of fact you didn't. What about the girl, Zuzu Petals, how does she fit in?  I mean, she is what this case is about.
Make eye contact when you say that.
Celebrate?  Like we celebrated after solving the White Bluesman murders?  Forget it, man.
Let's get her out of here, before she starts a shoot-out.  Drop us at my place.
I don't know.  I'm so scared. Help me.
Why are all these people after me?
I dunno.  He was to sound what Cezanne was to image or at least I thought so.  Ever since he died, I've been chased... <u>Omigod</u>!
How is it you can look at that HairHead and see God, when all I see is a lucky asshole from Reseda.
You know rock-n-roll?  Darlin', I've been in the music industry for as long as you've lived.  I've seen things you can't even have nightmares about... but then I guess I'm just not equipped to know the industry the way you do...
No.  Who's Art Mooney?
Friends?  You didn't tell me that.
Ye-ah.
I won't ask why you would want to help someone trying to kill you, but hey, good job.  Shall we?
There's that question...
I'll mail you a letter, come on!
Just be thankful he wasn't dissatisfied with his sex life.
Jesus, how could you be so stupid?  Come on, we're going to a hospital.
Good news is that yeah, I found him.  The bad news is...
You think you're so hot just because you can get into any club. You think you're so hot, just because you have sex with great- looking women.  You think you're so hot just because you broke the Ensenada tape piracy ring...
You gotta be kidding!  This is unfuckingbelievable!  I have to start the evening crawling down Capital Records, I shoulda chose suicide then, but oh no, the night was young!  Next up, my guitar! The second most important thing I own and now it's toothpicks for the homeless on Hollywood Boulevard!  Then, then, after I burned up your brother, Jazz... I should say as a fucking footnote I've usually treated women like shit -- used corsages, the wet spot, you know giving out Domino's Pizza's phone number and saying it's mine... Tonight was different. I felt respect.  I felt love.  Then Jazz left me... and <u>now</u> I get to die!
Golly, I'd probably faint.
Are you okay?
Ciao.
What is this, are you holding a microphone behind my head?
I'll tell you when somebody pays me to give a shit and stuff.
Hey, the poet...
Zuzu Petals.  Sounds like a drug. A lethal one.
Takin' care o' business, honey.
You know I hadda meet some people tonight --
Yeah?
Did you ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?
I wasn't looking.
Who's this --
You must take me for an imbecile. Why do you think I asked you to meet me in Washington?  I haven't spent five minutes in New York City without the company of a gendarme.
Are you having trouble raising the half million?
Look, Mr. Charnier, you got to be reasonable.
Avec ça tu pourras le supporter.
Pour moi?
Non!
I'm going to put them on the cat.
But will they?
What difference does it make? We'll be out of the country Friday.
Mmm.
S'right.
Willie Mays.
Strike out, eh?
Not a chance.
Hey, I thought we come for a drink.
Hunh-uh.  Check the bread.  He spreads it like the Russians are in Jersey.
He was the bank on that shipment outta Mexico three years ago.
This could be it, Walter.  This Candy Store guy, putting on a big show in a fancy nightclub with known connections all over him. Then on our own, after working the whole day and night, we tail him out to Brooklyn and sit on him for a week practically, and who do we come up with?  Joel Weinstock.  You gotta let us have it.
Yeah.
I can't.
Let yourself in.
Sixty days.  Here.  Don't mention it.
Whatta you got?
Forty dollars -- was $250.
Just for mistakes of parking?
Darling, may I have this one?
What is that old building?
You remember Mary Finelli?
What I know is what I told you.
Nicky Moore.  Patty Ryan.  Mary Finelli. These names mean anything to you, asshole?  Julia Sullivan!  She mean anything?  She means something to me!
There's a manhole at Canal and Bowery.
Stay with me, Gib.  We're gonna do this.
Did he?
I tucked him in at Gordo's.
Wish you weren't.
I'm sorry, Frank, but you need to come outside.
I think you know, Frank.
He's not gonna stop, Satch.  He's gonna keep on...
How's that?
Frank, this is insane...
Next time lets put some money on it.
I know.  Sorry, Dad.
I'm doing it!  I'm doing it!
WB2YKXB, who've I got?
Pal, my whole life's an emergency.
Yeah.  It was all over after Buford nailed Seaver's first pitch outta the park.
Wasn't too tough, buddy.  Game happened almost thirty years ago.
Uh huh...
Nothing...I just spilled something.
What's happening?
What if it's not...
Wait a sec...there was something on the news.  Something about this space anomaly.  I think they said it was connected to some storm in '69.
1998.
I'm trying to be, Dad.  I'm tyrin'.  It's good to hear your voice.  I missed you...so much.
It's okay.  I'm still here, Chief.
Fire.
Tell me.
Something we did changed the case...changed history.  Mom wasn't dead.  But then after you didn't die in the fire something must have happened.  And this guy, this Nightingale guy, he kept on killing...it was like a spree...seven more women.
They'll question her.  Whatever they tell her could change what happens.  No, I want you to follow her.  See if anybody's watching her, hittin' on her. I'm betting somebody's gonna walk outta that bar with her.  When they do, you call the cops.
We're okay...we're good, Dad.
Well, game five was the big one.  It turned in the bottom of the 6th.  We were down 3-0.  Cleon Jones gets hit on the foot - left a scuff mark on the ball. Clendenon comes up.  The count goes to 2 2.  High fastball.  He nailed it.  Weis slammed a solo shot in the 7th to tie. Jones and Swoboda scored in the 8th.  We won, Pop.
I know...  But Dad, you can't go back.  You didn't die in that fire.  And no matter what you do, nothing is gonna change that.  So all we can do is deal with this...and try to make it right.
What?
What...
What the hell is that smell?
Fire?  What are you talking about?  He had cancer, John.
April 16...?  That means she was the first.
Sounds good.
No.  Missing teenager.  Disappeared thirty years ago.  Found her bones last week.  Buried behind some old diner, up by Dyckman street.  Mary Finelli.
You have the right to remain silent.  If you give up that right...
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
I mean, is there any place in particular where we can drop you off?
Actually, I have no idea what the World's Record is.  I was just kidding.
Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.
Cool it, Andy.
Sounds disgusting.  Let's go.
First we take off our clothes, then you get on top of me or I get on top of you...
Yes, man!
Why?
Hello.  How are you?
Okay.  There's a whole weekend ahead of us.  There's time.
The quiet can fool you.  It fooled me.  You can never be sure of what's out there.
Sort of.
My whole world.
Stick around and you'll see.
Destroy the evidence, Pronto!
Why don't you help us?
May be please have the wallet.
Just keep your eyes on the road.
No time to explain.  Just listen. When I yell "stop," you jam on the brakes as hard as you can.  Okay?
Alright, alright.
That's a freakin' fact.  Least of all us.
He really believes Jason's still alive, doesn't he?
Yeah, but the game's not over until it's over.
This is taking forever.  I'm starving.
Megan, my deputies have more important things to do than look for camp counselors with car trouble.
Tommy, my father is out looking for you right now.  Something happened tonight and he's sure you're responsible.  If he finds you, he'll...
Hide it behind the gas station. Then we can get the hell out of here.
No.
Come and get it.
Wait a minute. I just...
It probably wouldn't have any effect on him.  The only sure way to stop Jason is to return him to his original resting place, where he drowned in 1957.
Nancy.
No more.
Why?
Who ya calling?
No...Did Megan say when she's coming back from her...visit?
I don't know.  He called somebody, then took off.
Yeah, he was gonna check out "things that go bump in the night."
Either you go to sleep or I'll come in there and put you out.
I got a bad feeling of what might've happened to them.
But they have to be warned, Sheriff.  Jason will return to the area that's familiar.  No matter what you call it, it's still Camp Crystal Lake to him.
Skin stretcher was human.
So let's talk.
The what?
I need to talk to you.
Thirty.  Name your price.  Everyone has a price, what's yours?
It's going.
Okay, I'll call you later.
I'm just too old for going steady, Josh.
Why don't you blow me, Chief.  After your girlfriend gets through.
That's all right.  I was just...
Her name's Stephanie.
Absolutely.  The church even sent me an autographed picture of God.  Ward!
Oh, c'mon, would you stop, please?
Sorry, I'm working now.  You see, I have a job...
Okay.
The truth?  That Josh, a man I've trusted with my own life on more than one occasion -- let me see if I've got the order right here -- tried to rape Diana...got the back of his head blown off...took a poker through the gut...fell through a plate glass window and then magically disappeared into the night.
That's a lie.  Diana would never talk to you about Jessica.  Not after what you did to her.
No -- she left me!  After her miscarriage, I --
Ten dollars! Hell, I can't do that to you -- you can have her for a pizza.
So what else is new?  Look Eva, you're asking the wrong dude to feel sorry for Tamara Mason. Wise up -- it's not hip to be her friend.
Sounds good. I hear there's a shuffleboard court on deck -- it might be kinds cool...
Do you realize how many people would kill to be sitting here right now? Come on, it's grad night. You've got your whole life to be uptight.
I have her in Creative Writing and she's fairly nice.
Nothing.
I mean, Lakeview High just closed its doors for good, right?
And you'll never do it again.
No.
She changed her mind.  Let's see...Mr. Wolfe is in stateroom one-eleven and you, Mr. Robertson, are in two-twenty-five.
We have to get off this ship!!
But I haven't even shown you my biology project...
Charles, there's someone else coming along too.
And neither do you. It's up to Rennie to decide what she wants to do.
She's locked safe in her room, no thanks to either of you.  Has he brought it back on course yet?
Perfect for a swim, isn't it?
I'm staying.
I don't even know why I'm afraid, Uncle Charles. I can't even remember when it started. Don't you think it's time I found out and got over it?
I was only trying to teach you. But I pulled you out, Rennie. I saved your life.
I don't know what to say...
I gathered that.
It's not that simple.
Whenever I get near the water, I see this young boy drowning. He tries to pull me down with him.
No. It was just a normal summer. I've never been able to figure it out.
What is your location?
What did you find?
Shut up, Elliot.
Asbestos lining.
I can tell you the year, the day, the night, the minute.
Before his Broadway days. He reviewed the one-act I did at the Fulton Fish Market. We did this play at four AM, outdoors in the rain. One performance. For the fish handlers.
Steven Schwimmer. I memorized every word of this review.
Do not inhale.
That was a big mistake.
It's your best play, Nicky.
The American theater doesn't need people like that.
Paisley Porter.
She was very evasive.
This could be it.
Let's work on it.
You know about Adele.
Three games to two. But if you know their history, you realize there's a tragedy in the making. I've been carrying this franchise on my back since I was six years old.
I go to college. I thought you knew.
I don't drink coffee, Daddy. And this is not what we should be talking about.
Why do you need a radio?
That's completely crazy.
And he hears it the same time I hear it? What happened to family secrets?
You're too young to be studying criminal behavior. It's making you obsessive.
I'm not sure.
Everything.
Yes.
Even if the truth about a person is sad or depressing or shocking?
Yes.
I've seen it twice. I went back tonight to be sure. It's a brave and honest piece of work.
I don't want to be responsible for his food. Just a small green salad. And a Perrier.
You know why, don't you? Because I am patient, chain-smoking Lillian.
That's very lovely actually.
It violates so many trusts.
I never thought of Dr. Wetzel as having a sex life outside the office.
I'm glad we're having this talk.
Washed away.
I'm at the door.
Where are your glasses? Go get them.
It was rummy, not poker. But I'll take a chance and let you in.
The Red Sox are your problem. I never understood about you and the Red Sox. Everybody rooted for the Yankees.
He does bless me, each and every day. Matthew's mother works a hospital shift, so I pick him up at school. We stop for a meal usually around this time. He does his homework and gets some experience meeting people. But we never had a famous mobster before.
That's my cousin, Angelo.
I want to say it because my whole life may depend on these next few moments.
I went to college in Boston so I could be near the Red Sox. I took summer classes and the cut them to go to the game. My wife is from Boston. Lillian Ziegler?
You're out of bullets.
You're not making sense.
But I know you, don't I? I seen you on a poster in the theater district. I'll think of your name in just a --
Sidney.
I kissed Shirley Felder on the teeth.
I kissed her while she was laughing.
That's the line I can't ever, for the life of me remember. I just can't get it.
A little.
He has -- something. A funny little quality I find --
Engaging.
A little drastic maybe?
Peter Redmond is an actor I admire enormously.
He doesn't want to meet some out-of- work ingenue.
There's a certain kind of wounded young man who uses his oddness to get laid. Is that our Steven?
I haven't come to you.
Of course it's unfair. The truth is always unfair. Why do you think I live this way? Hiding out. Stealing electricity from a lamp post. Because people who write the truth are outcasts of society. I can't live openly, in a nice clean doorman building, with my name on the mailbox. They'd come after me in packs.
And I thought, at last, she's here, she wants me.
Mr. Khan said they called you brave.
In this place there are no untouchables -- and no work is beneath any of us!
All the more reason.
"I will follow close behind you and help to serve the people."
One more.
I'm sorry.
Yes. I've -- I've met some very remarkable people in India... and -- and when I read what you've been doing here, I -- I wanted to help.  Does that surprise you?
Going nearer to God!
Did they take your clothes?
I think you do.  But I thank God we all don't.
It does. We must be getting old, Charlie.
How does a reporter in Central America learn that Gandhi was born in Porbandar anyway?
"Hell!"
That's right. The word only means "community." But it could stand for "village"... or the world.
Hm.  Is it?
A great deal.
It would have been uncivil of me to have let you make such a long trip for nothing.
My name is Walk-er. And I intend to report it the way it is.
No... no. In every temple and mosque they have pledged to die before they lift a hand against each other.
That's young Nehru. He's got his father's intellect, his mother's looks and the devil's charm. If they don't ruin him at Cambridge -- Wave! Wave! -- he may amount to something.
Not true!  The secret is mastering the urge.
That's when you take advantage.
Allah be praised. And what battalions will you call upon?
Don't worry -- I've never seen men so determined. You've given them a way to fight... And I don't think --
Thank you. No.
Somehow I expected not.
Who's leading them?
He's "discovering" India.
No -- but I think I'm going to.
Bapu -- please. Where are you going.
It's over.
Er, no...
Not yet, I'm afraid.
I guess I'm a slow learner.
No.  Not <i>likely</i>.
Blood.  From the vein.
Get it.  From outside, if you have to.
Where did you get this?
No, but since there aren't too many <i>live</i> ones tonight either, you won't mind us conducting one further sweep.  If he does not work here, then there should be no other trace of him.  I think you'd better get some people out of bed, Detective.  In the meantime we can re-check his favorite haunt.
I've been looking for him.  Do you know where he is?
Six one.
Yeah.  You want to go dancing tonight?
Leave?  Just a few million years ago every atom in this hair--in our bodies--was a part of a star. I don't see it as leaving.  I see it as going home.
He was still warm when they confirmed.
The place is crawling with Hoovers.
It's okay, Eugene.
How could they recognize you?  <i>I</i> don't recognize you.  Anyway, you don't have a choice.  You run, you may as well sign a confession, turn us both in right now.  No, we stick this out-- find out what we can but change nothing.  This is a minor inconvenience is all it is.  We've taken worse heat than this.  Jesus, if I'd known you were going to go belly up on me at the last fucking gasp, I wouldn't have bothered.  You can't quit on me now.  I've put too much into this.  Besides, this stuff is <i>mine</i>.  I had other offers, you know.  I could have rented myself out to somebody with a spine.  You want me to wheel in there and finish the job myself?  We'll take off all right, from pad 18 just like we planned.
I don't feel too good.  I think I'm still drunk from last night.
If I were you I'd worry about myself.  Haven't you forgotten something?
How would you like to be yourself for the day?
Not bad, Jerome.
I'm travelling too.
--We didn't want--<i>diseases</i>, yes.
They are not babies, Maria, merely "human possibilities".
German, is that you?
Why not?
I've found him too.
I was at home.
They found an eyelash.
You celebrate, Jerome?
Those checks take forever.
It's not safe.  I shouldn't have brought you here.
We could go together one day.
I'll tell you at the end of the week.
--Unfortunately my son's not all that they promised.  But then, who know what he could do.
I can't do this.
I heard about you. You work with Miller.
They will be ready. You guys do your job.
I bet.
My license expired, let's get out of here.
I want to take a walk.
Small town, small bank, big money.
Better than old times.
Assumed name... Houston.
That Beynon's got a long arm.
Whisky and a peach.
Just the way I remembered.
Pretty good... Made a quick trip to Oregon, saw my brother and the kids. Figured it would be my last chance, unless they wanted to travel.
Fatter... some things never change.
You were asleep.
Is he straight?
I couldn't have... much longer.
But I got you out. Didn't I, Doc. I did it. I got you out.
I laugh when I feel happy. Sometimes just thinking of you made me laugh. I had a lot of that. And other times that wasn't enough. I had a lot of that too. I know you find it hard to believe, I'm happy just loving you.
For exits off Main Street.
Bullshit.
What the hell do you want? Mary Tyler Moore?
It isn't another boyfriend, is it?
Fifteen minutes.
You bastard...
I mean it.
You've got all the answers. What about when they find the body on the train?
No... there's a couple of things I'm still working on.
I'll tell you something, Doc. One day you're going to have to trust somebody...
You keep it up and it won't matter how far we get away, because it's going to be all over between you and me. Do you understand that? There won't be anything left.
Twenty eight hundred.
No scars.
It's all a game, don't bother me.
Whatever happens it's over.
You want to try with me?
Get your clothes on, move your butt.
They will have our description before we can get a plane.
No, I'm afraid not.
Oh my God.
Sure can. I'd like an Invicta 12-gauge pump with the twenty-inch barrel.
Two boxes of double-ought buck.
Might try that.
What about you?
He took the day off.
Just fine.
Mexico. I'd like to find a quiet place to cross.
I kinda doubt it.
Sure thing, mister, it's coming right up. 'Bout an hour. Quiet crossing that is.
Wish you hadn't said that. When Slim Canfield's lips are sealed, they're sealed.
Just... tell us what you want.
A Ford... We have a Ford.
The glucose will begin working in half an hour. You'll feel better then...
That's not possible. We can't leave here... we've got all this.
Yes, you do, Albert. Talk or I'll kill you.
Did Eric Pake pull her?
Yes, but listen. Christ, I didn't kill him.
What about?
You're a big man, but you're in bad shape. With me, it's a full- time job. Now behave yourself.
What name?
I had to. It was the only way I could get at them.
On the Durham Road. The Pantiles.
Fine...  I want to talk to you.
What do you mean? You've been Frank's bird ever since her mother cleared off. You're closer to her than anyone.
Once a week?
It's the truth.
Who?
No, do you really?
No. I didn't know that.
So where are we going, Princess?
Of course. Where else?
Especially when I play the lead.
I don't know.
No.
No.
At me friend's house.
Right.
Went to school with him.  He was leader of our gang. He'll know what's going on in this town.
How'd you find me?
Her husband docks tomorrow, does he?
No, you won't.
Don't ask me.
What about Keith?
You must be joking. I never eat breakfast,  Did you sleep well?
Yes, thank you.
No. Are you tired?
What you doing around here then?
I've always ad your welfare at heart, Eric. Besides which, I'm nosy.
And you should know, if I remember rightly.
Piss off, Ray.
Harry! Jack, I don't want to be rude, but these men have brought a lot of money with them. Glenda, you don't offer a man like Jack a drink in those piddling little glasses.  Give him the bloody bottle.  Now, where are we?
That, Harry? That's another hundred - twenty-five pounds notes of the realm.
I'm not?
They came in and they, you know...
And now...
We're stuck with this fucking shit...
You know who it is.  It's Mitch. And Murray.  'Cause it doesn't have to be this way.
The leads, the overhead, the telephones, there's lots of things.
No, it's not that simple, Dave...
What?
That's what I...
What do you mean?
Someone should hurt them.
Yes.
Yes.
What did you say?
We are?
That's right.  It's a crime.  It is a crime.  It's also very safe.
Have I said that?
Did you talk to Graff?
He would take you on.  Yes.
Yes.
What does that mean?
No.
...they take me, then.  They're going to ask me who were my accomplices.
Well, to the law, you're an accessory.  Before the fact.
Then tough luck, George, because you are.
You went for it.
So I'm making it concrete.
Because you listened.
Yeah.  That's swell.  Yes.  You're right.  How are you?
They're ancient.
That's...
That's not...Fuck that shit, George. You're a, hey, you had a bad month. You're a good man, George.
Yes.  The cops.  No.
Why?  Because they're stupid. "Where were you last night..."
Where was I?
Was I?
No.
You understand?
You...
Thank you, George.
Rick, I'm going to flag a cab.
That they're going to be upset.
The leads come in, I'll let...
How the fuck do I know?  What...talk to me.
Would you excuse us, please.
Yes, I have a problem.  Yes, I do, my fr...It's not me that ripped the joint off, I'm doing business. I'll be with you in a while.  You got it...?  Where are you going?
And let's put this together.  Okay? Shel?  Say okay.
...and what is that, John?  What? Bad luck.  That's all it is.  I pray in your life you will never find it runs in streaks.  That's what it does, that's all it's doing. Streaks.  I pray it misses you. That's all I want to say.
...then what is this "you say" shit, what is that?  What is that...?
You're saying that I'm fucked.
Let me tell you something, Shelly. I do what I'm hired to do. I'm...wait a second.  I'm hired to watch the leads.  I'm given...hold on, I'm given a policy.  My job is to do that.  What I'm told.  That's it.  You, wait a second, anybody falls below a certain mark I'm not permitted to give them the premium leads.
Murray said...
Murray said...
Either way.  You're out.
You start closing again, you'll be on the board.
And what if you don't close.
You fucking asshole.  I haven't got it.  I haven't got it, John.  I'll pay you tomorrow.  I'm coming in here with the sales, I'll pay you tomorrow.  I haven't got it, when I pay, the gas...I get back the hotel, I'll bring it in tomorrow.
I'll give you thirty on them now, I'll bring the rest tomorrow.  I've got it at the hotel.  John?  We do that, for chrissake?
Because I say so.
You can't learn that in an office. Eh?  He's right.  You have to learn it on the streets.  You can't buy that.  You have to live it.
What are you talking about?
Well, hadn't it?
I don't know what you are saying.
Uh-huh?
I want to tell you something, Shelly.  You have a big mouth.
You stick around I'll pull the memo for you.  I'm busy now...
My ass.  I told 'em.  Listen to this: I said...
Ricky?...That I don't care they stole the contracts?
Shut the fuck up.  Ricky.  You have a mean streak in you...  And what the fuck are you babbling about...? 
They took the phones...
Last night, this morning.
Bruce..."I don't want to fuck around with you.  I don't want to go round this, and pussyfoot around the thing, you have to look back on this.  I do, too.  I came here to do good for you and me.  For both of us.  Why take an interim position? 
...and you don't remember. 'Cause you weren't around.  That's cold calling.  Walk up to the door.  I don't even know their name.  I'm selling something they don't even want.  You talk about soft sell... before we had a name for it...before we called it anything, we did it.
Well, we'll do that this weekend.
Sure.
Oh, my God, you're right!  I'm on the one...  Well, let's scoot...
Kenilworth...?
I don't know.
What do I...?
I've got to get Ray to O'Hare...  Come on, let's hustle...  John!  Call American Express in Pittsburgh for Mr. Morton, will you, tell them he's on the one o'clock. 
She called the consumer...the attorney, I don't know.  The attorney gen...they said we have three days...
Three days.
To change our minds.
That's what they are.  Three business...I wait till Monday, my time limit runs out.
But I'm not counting it.  Wednesday.  Thursday.  Friday.  So it would have elapsed.
Tuesday.
You tell me again.
We're going to speak to her.
I...
The power to negotiate.
You going to turn State's?
Fuckin' cop's got no right talk to me that way.  I didn't rob the place...
I'm going home.
Some of them...
...some of the contracts...Lingk. James Lingk.  I closed...
Yes.
Then I'm over the fucking top and you owe me a Cadillac.
With what?  With what, John, they took the leads...
I'm giving you three leads.  You...
Three.
Mr. Lingk and I are going to...
 He's going to kill Fanucci.
I know, it was chaos; but anyway, here I am one week late.  This is for my Mama.  You remember Merle?
Connie.
I hate to see you cringe in front of him.  How come you're so scared of your own kid brother?
Dancing is alright; you're falling on the floor.
Mike, what can I do, she's a hysterical woman...
 You must understand, this is all new to me...
Get a good night's sleep.  We got a new suit, new shirt, new tie, and I'm going to shave you myself. Tomorrow we want you to look respectable for fifty million of your fellow Americans.
I didn't turn against nobody; he turned against me.
It's all right.  He stays with me all the time.
We're making an investment in Havana.
Pentangeli's dead.  He was ambushed by the Rosato Brothers.  Didn't you know that?
I want you to help me, Fredo.
I never looked down on you, Fredo. You don't look down at a brother.
You know her; drives me crazy, one minute she's a popsicle, the next she's all vinegar.  Sometimes I think... I think - I should a married someone, like you did.  To have kids, to have a family.
What do you want me to do?
What about now, is there anything you can help me out with?
Beautiful.
 And he agreed?
I'm supposed to stay in my house.
How long does this go on?
With Mama, putting the baby to sleep.  Francesca's very happy. Michael was kind to her.  She idolizes him.  The children are all out in the speedboat.  I'm going to my house.
I wanted to tell you alone; your wife doesn't know what's going on.
Yes.
Sure, Mikey.
A little care he can ride in with an electric motor.
Mike, it's impossible.  He'll be met by the Internal Revenue; the Customs Service, and half the FBI.
Mike wants it.
Al, as far as you're concerned, I'm the Don.
He's going to try Panama...
Did my brother go back?
He's ten times tougher than me, my brother.  He's old-fashioned.
Tom, what do I do now?
Yeah, I still read a lot.  They bring me stuff.
Yeah, but only the rich guys.  The little guys got knocked off.  If they got arrested and executed, all their estate went to the Emperor. If they just went home and killed themselves, up front, nothing happened.
You know there's a Senate Investigating Committee recently set up; we thought it would be unfortunate if they were to trace anything though-provoking to your name.
We'll keep it quiet; the people who know are trustworthy...the Committee needn't find out.
Very well.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Corleone.  We're not to let you through.
If you could just give us a list, we'll pick up anything you want.
I'm not going to stay long; I can't.
Tell me, Michael.  What really happened with Pentangeli?
And that's all he had to do.  Just show his face.
I'll bring the children up now; they want to say goodbye.
Michael.
Oh, I do feel things for you, Michael; but now, I think it's pity. For the first time since I've known you, you seem so helpless.  You held me a prisoner once; will you try again?
You haven't heard me.
It wasn't a miscarriage.  And you with your cunning, couldn't you figure it out!  It was an abortion; an abortion, like our marriage is an abortion, something unholy and evil.  I don't want your son; I wouldn't bring another of your sons into this world.  An abortion, Michael... it was a son, and I had it killed, but this must all end!
You're a great man, Mr. Roth, I have much to learn from you.
Then it's done.  I must choose his replacement: it cannot be Rosato.
I saw an interesting thing today. A man was being arrested by the Military Police; probably an urban guerrilla.  Rather than be taken alive, he exploded a grenade hidden in his jacket, taking the command vehicle with him.
We're making a big investment in Cuba.  That's my only concern.
How is his health?
Is there anything I can do; anything I can send?
Let him gamble.
I deny his every charge.
That is a complete falsehood.
They feel cheated.
Your family still carries the name Corleone, and you will run it like a Corleone!
No.  There are things that I have planned with Hyman Roth.  I don't want them disturbed.
Frankie, you know my father respected Roth, did business with him.
I didn't want you to know I was coming.  You heard what happened in my home?
Michael, anything.  What is it I can do for you?
I was just going to contact you, Michael; we just had a 'sit-down' - in fact, I just come from there.
I thought we would meet alone.
Turnbull is a good man.
All right, then let me say you'll pay me because it's in your interests to pay me.
Sure, on me.  I got Diner's Club.
We got no choice.
That's a lucky C note for our new deal.
How much more a month?
Yes.
What was that?
I say let loverboy watch his movie.  And be grateful Boone's not cutting Shirley Temple's lawn.
Just thinking out loud.
All right, then.  He's interested in you for your conversation.  We know what a great talker you are.
Maybe it's supposed to be funny.
Hey, no strings, right?  That's what you always said.  Just good pals who have the hots for each other.
You liked it too.
The Master is waiting for you.
No.  No.  I am sorry.  Forget everything I say.  Here.  I will take the tray.
Long enough.  Fifteen years.
No.  We live simply, Mr. Jimmy and I.  People come to play bridge. And now and then, young men to swim.  You have people, Boone?
A homo?
There is nothing you can say that will surprise me.
I blame my daughter for keeping me out so late.  I only hope you did not get him excited.  It could give him a new stroke.
I put him to bed.  He's not there?
What's to sketch?
Broke is more like it.
Football in college.
But why?
I'm not wearing an undershirt.
All right already.  I'll take it off.  Kind of warm in here anyway.
We weren't rich.  But we weren't poor either.
I don't mind.  I'm not crazy about my old man either.
Go ahead.
Did anyone laugh?
Pity.  People are so earnest nowadays.
Of course.  I had to make it interesting for myself, you see.  A comedy about death.  The trick is not to ruin it for anyone who isn't in on the joke.  But the Monster never receives any of my gibes.  He is noble.  Noble and misunderstood.
Sorry.  I don't feel like sitting still today.
No, I -- you're a homosexual.
You don't think of me that way, do you?
No.  I --
But we have to match the other sketch.
Not at the moment.
Thoreau with a lawnmower.
Not fear.  More like disgust.
Clayton is fine.
Nothing of importance.  Just two old men slapping each other with lilies.  Shall we have a drink?
Why not?  Give us something to do while we wait.
What did you expect?  Bronze?
For the artistic effect.  The combination of your human body and that inhuman mask.  It's quite striking.
Please, Clayton.  Just for a minute.  Long enough for me to see the effect.
Nothing I didn't deserve.
Pray you, undo this button.
All right.
She took the night off.  Heavy date.  Some guy she's had her eye on for a while.
I wanted to be alert for your visit today.  Especially since I saw so little of you in the hospital.
Just what I was about to ask you. I thought you were in New York.
Oh, David, stop being a nanny.
Well the rest of us aren't.  Can't you remember that?
Then who did?
In the sequel, James, two lady scientists should make a monster. And our monster would be Gary Cooper.
More your line.
Bone?  Boom?  Something Bee.  I hire him while you were in the hospital.  He came cheap.
She is beautiful.
Righto.  Let me see.
Head.  Not heart.
I'm sorry I spoiled it for you. You should probably go home.
Don't think that, Mr. Whale.  I love your movies.  That's why I wanted you to come to this.  So I could see you with your monsters.
Only hurts when I breathe. Lookit you. Where are Barney Fife and Aunt Bea hanging out? And Opie ... Where's Opie at?
Six years ...
Maybe she don't know. Although I don't see how that could be. Maybe she didn't want to upset you -
Who do you think?
Yeah Tell him to lay off Kip and them Tell him it's on
How ya doing?
I knew you'd say that, too --
I don't know about that, Randall. He did such a good job on this paper. And another one just came in ...
Let them go --
You don't have anything on me. A misdee auto-theft. I got no record. I'll be out in three days, and back at it. Or you let them go, and I give you my word. I'm gone. And without the ringleader ... Your tee-times have just grown exponentially...
Get out of here, then. Now.
A little family emergency --
No...
Something like that -
Cadillac.
You'll get the hang of it, kid. You just need to remember one thing -
It's the same way with cars. Different cars. Different tunes. You can't steal a Maserati listening to Sinatra. You gotta get urgent. You gotta get Sonny Rollins or Led Zeppelin IV, on that shit. But never, never-ever take no Allman Brothers into a Lincoln Town Car. Could lead to disaster. Got it... ?
That's an after-market alarm. Can't just cut her wires ...
It's all microchips and shit ...
Of course not. I'm Robin Hood. I take from the rich, and give to the needy...
Hey, Donny --
Hell, yeah. Mirror Man here is our electronics expert. He's got some gadgets you old farts maybe never -heard of; Tumbler can drive anything with wheels, and some things without; Toby's a hacker, can do things with a computer, that are pretty amazing ...
How you doing, man?
That's right. Only 10 exotics ...
And there she is --
Dignity...
one minute -- !
That's a good one, Donny...
Thanks for playing, Freb. That's a gimme ...
How's Kip?
Every day. I wonder about that every day...
You remember that, Kip?
I got a message. I live at 1443 Locklin.
NO! No, I can't! I'm a busy man.
Oh, for God's sake
It's ear-marked for Mirror Man and The Sphinx...
What do you say, Toby?,
Don't go there, Toby --
I dunno ...
What am I supposed to do?
Just hold on... Hold on ...
Totally. I'm fine. You want a beer, man -- ?
Yeah, man. Where is your beer?
Yeah --
I can handle it --
I can handle it --
Me.
Me...
Otto called -
"Shadow games?"
The era when crime didn't pay --
I dunno. Whatever will be will be...
I don't know. What -- ?
Sure, man --
Where we going -- ?
For real?
A distinction worth noting ...
Yes. But I got a feeling it's not on account of any longing-for-my-touch on your part -
What's wrong with her -- ?
No. Open her ...
No. I had a girl. She was great. The problem is: great girls come along once every ten years. So I gotta wait another three years before I can even bother to look...
"Unlock my button" ... ?
Wrong preposition...
How is he -- ?
Yeah ... You -- ?
Of course. Hi, Junie --
The chop-shop... Where are the stripped cars?  The rolled-back odometers? The part bins?
He's gotten involved --
It can be done. Take two days to shop; one to prep. I'll offer up my bible for a small fee. You also have to hope Kip's jerk-circus didn't undo Castlebeck's linkage so much so that he's setting up surveillance teams on every city block. And then get yourself a crew...
No we don't -
You sure I can't go with ya?
Excuse me --
Why you gotta front me like that? I'm talking to Kip --
I known Kip longing than you, man ...
The oldest one.  He was in an argument. A lousy ten-dollar card game. The kid pulls out a gun. It goes off. The kid gets killed. The grandmother hears it and finds out he's been arrested. She has a heart attack.  She drops dead right on the spot. Now Jeannie's got a husband and son in jail and a mother in the funeral parlor.
No. Come on. It was the younger one that was the bad one.
Billy, how are you?
Busting his balls?  If I was busting your balls, I'd send you home for your shine box.
No more shines, Billy.
I've been all fucked up since I got out.
You treated me like shit.
Liar!
He watches it for me. It's better than waiting at a garage.
Are you nuts?  Jeannie's husband went to the can just to get away from her, she's such a pain in the ass. Let me tell you. Nobody goes to jail unless they want to, unless they make themselves get caught. They do stuff with the wrong people. They don't have things organized. You know who goes to jail? Nigger stickup men. That's who. And they only get caught because they fall asleep in the getaway car.
Jezuz Christ!
What am I doing? I'm in here! I'm in jail. I can't stop people from coming to see me.
I can't do it anymore.
Safe? Here? They'll kill me here. They're all afraid I'm gonna rat them out. People are already looking to walk away from me. I'm dead in here. You gotta get me out.
Just get me out.
You what?
Bring the car round back. I know a place Upstate they'll never find him.
Jimmy. He'll be okay. He's good for it. Relax.
I gotta talk to you.
There are cops all over the place.
Who else? Paulie got the okay. This little guinea fuck. Someday he's gonna be a boss. Can you believe someday we'll work for him.
Come on, don't fuck around, will ya?
Jimmy, come on. Fuck 'em. Don't give them the satisfaction.
Nah.
Jimmy and I could never be made, because we bad Irish blood. It didn't even matter that my mother was Sicilian. To become a member of a crew, you've got to be one hundred percent Italian So that they can trace all your relatives back to the old country.
He was jumpy. He hadn't touched a thing. In the old days, Jimmy would have ordered doubles and eaten it all.  On the surface, of course, everything was supposed to be fine. We were supposed to be discussing my case, just like we always would, but I had a feeling Jimmy was trying to sense whether I was going to rat him out to save my neck.
Yeah.
Done.
Jesus! You must think I'm dumb. What are you bugging me for? I know what to do!
I don't give a shit. That guy's got no right.
Keep him here. I'm going for a bag.
Tommy  ...
It's okay. I'll make it up.  I promise. Just hurry it up a little. Okay?
Jimmy.  I don't know.  I got so much else on my mind.  I got the kids.  We got no money.
Ma!  Stop! What do you want me to do?
Stayed out? Daddy never went out at all.
But I'm worried. I'm hearing all kinds of things. Paulie.  You know me all my life.  I've always done the right thing.
What? Come on!
Okay. He's driving along and this fuckin' cat jumps in front of his car, and so he hits this cat--
We're not goin'.  I don't even like "Kelly's."
Why not?
Don't get too slap-happy, you're takin' me home first. WILL I don't know, Chuck. It's kinda outta the way.
Oh I'm sure, that's why only one of us has herpes.
No, I had to talk him down.
So, you ladies ah, go to school here?
See ya' Chuckie. I had fun.
You were the only Sullivan in the phone book.
You caught that, huh?
--and he's like "shit! Motherfucker!" And he looks in his rearview and sees this cat-- I'm sorry--
So why don't you give me my sandwhich?
What the fuck? I just asked you for a job yesterday!
So in the morning, there's a knock on the door it's the Statie. So my Uncle's like, "Is there a problem?" And the Statie's like "I pulled you over and you took off." And my Uncle's like "I never seen you before in my life, I been home all night with my kids." And Statie's like "Let me get in your garage!" So he's like "All right, fine." He takes around the garage and opens the door --and the Statie's cruiser is in my Uncle's garage.
I'm Irish.
Why don't you beat off at your house?
Shut the fuck up.
--These circumstances are mitigated. Right now. They're mitigated.
Retainer...
I have about seventy-three...
Good, it was all right.
No students work for me.
What're those?
That's right.
I think so.
An integer.
I'm pretty sure it's right.
Will, what happened at the Tri-tech meeting?
Will, on your own time, you can do what you like. When I set up a meeting, with my associates, and you don't show up it reflects poorly on me.
I'll cancel every meeting right now. I'll give you a job myself. I just wanted you to see what was out there.
I just want you to know...It's been a pleasure.
I did.
Since Nancy died.
Tom.
Cutting edge mathematics. Think tanks. The kind of place where a mind like Will's is given free reign.
Now wait a minute, Gerry--
I know what I'm doing and I know why I'm here!
Why do you think he does that, Gerry?
--And who do you think he's handling? He pushes people away before they have a chance to leave him. And for 20 years he's been alone because of that. And if you try to push him into this, it's going to be the same thing all over again. And I'm not going to let that happen to him!
That's it. That's why I don't come to the goddamn reunions! Becaue I can't stand the look in your eye when you see me! You think I'm a failure! I know who I am. I'm proud of who I am. And all of you, you think I'm some kind of pity case! You with your sycophant students following you around. And you Goddamn Medal!
Yeah. Summer vacation. Thought I'd travel some. Maybe write a little bit.
Now you know Will, and I know, what you need to be doing. You have a gift.
Like what, Will?
I did.
--Well, maybe that means you.
Maybe you married the wrong woman.
That's it isn't it? You married the wrong woman. She leave you? Was she bangin' someone else?
You've never been out of Boston.
Yeah, I went on a date last week.
I know what I'm doing. She's different from the other girls I met. We have a really good time. She's smart, beautiful, fun...
Why? So I can realize she's not so smart. That she's boring. You don't get it. Right now she's perfect, I don't want to ruin that.
Hence, the word remarried.
Yeah.
Lon? He got married. He has a kid. I kind of lost touch with him after Nancy got sick.
Why? Because of the pain I feel now? I have regrets Will, but I don't regret a singel day I spent with her.
What?
Define that.
I didn't want the job.
I didn't ask for this.
Why is it a cop-out? I don't see anythin' wrong with layin' brick, that's somebody's home I'm buildin'. Or fixin' somebody's car, somebody's gonna get to work the next day 'cause of me. There's honor in that.
Look, a lot of that stuff goes back a long way.  And it's between me and him and it has nothing to do with you.
It sure ain't good.
It's not your fault.
It's not...
Yeah, I think so.
You're Welcome, Will.
I'm gonna travel a little bit, so I don't know where I'll be.
Good luck.
I kind of got that impression.
What?
It's Will, the really funny good looking guy you met at the bar?
You aren't, by any chance, Pre-law? Are you?
Okay...
No.
Yes you were.
Hey, I spent all my money on those caramels.
Bullshit.
Your house must have been a zoo.
Do you keep in touch with them?
I'm supposed to understand this.
Not tonight.
Some, a little.
What am I scared of?
Let 'er go, Gallagher!
How 'bout you?
Okay. I think you're a darn fool, though.
I'll get Rosasharn.
Whatsa matter, Ma? Gettin' scared?
Look at that ol' coffeepot steam!
Naw. They paroled me.
Thing's been workin' on me, what they was yellin' about. Got me all curious.
Was he bruised up this mornin'? About the face?
Okay. Go on.
Sure, but what is this?
Joad.
Four.
Why, I guess so.
An' you say no cops?
Pa always said you was never cut out to be a preacher.
Didn't you hear? It was in the papers.
I don't mind any more. I'd do what I done again. I killed a guy at a dance. We was drunk. He got a knife in me and I laid him out with a shovel. Knocked his head plumb to squash.
I aim to.
You ain't gonna blow nobody nowhere. First place, you'd get hung and you know it. For another, it wouldn't be two days before they'd have another guy here to take my place.
You know what I mean. You been givin' me a goin' over ever since I got in. Whyn't you go on and ask me where I been?
What you mean?
If we broke down maybe somebody'd give us a han'.
I didn't bust out. They lemme out. Howya, Noah. Howya, Uncle John.
And can't nobody *make* me go, either! Ain't nobody here *man* enough to make me! I'm a-stayin'.
You mean I can't even get outa here?
They use' to be a sayin': A chile born outa sorrow'll be a happy chile. An' another: Born outa too much joy'll be a doleful boy. That's the way I always heard it.
No'm.
Go get Tom an' Al.  I dunno what to do. I got to feed the fambly. What'm I gonna do with these here?
They charge extry at the comp'ny store but they ain't no other place.
She'll be awright.
I know. Maybe that makes us tough. Rich fellas come up an' they die, an' their kids ain't no good, an' they die out. But we keep a-comin'. We're the people that live. Can't nobody wipe us out. Can't nobody lick us. We'll go on forever, Pa. We're the people. 
I'd a found you, Ma.
I'm ready.
Granma's dead.
Get some sugar too, for the coffee.
He was a good man.
How'm I gonna know 'bout you? They might kill you an' I wouldn't know. They might hurt you. How'm I gonna know?
I know, ma'am... on'y it's for a ole lady, no teeth, gotta sof'n it with water so she can chew it, an' she's hongry.
I don't wanta rob you, ma'am.
There, them stripy ones.
I know that! But *where* they gone?
But what's happened?  How come they got to get off? We been here fifty years--same place.
But who done it?
Hide out for what? We ain't doin' nothin'.
But we couldn't *do* on any less'n what our share is now.  The chillun ain't gettin' enough to eat as it is, and they're so ragged we'd be shamed if ever'body else's chillun wasn't the same way.
It ain't nobody. It's a company.
Why, she wasn't no more'n a kid when I went up.
Not be so lonesome, either, knowin' his name is there with 'im, not just' a old fella lonesome underground.
I ain't gonna fret you. Go on!
Whatsa matter?
Now don't you go monk'ing--
I work at Kentucky Fried Chicken.
I sell biscuits and gravy all over the Southland--
Don't say that.
I sell BMW's. What do you do?
He gets this way when he hits over eighty-five.
I don't know exactly. I could venture a guess but it would sound like a rationalization... I thought you know... maybe seeing you, some friends, my house... of course now a 7-11--
--and I guess, sure, seeing you would be part of that whole equation... I suppose the most important thing, really. I don't know. Anyway, this whole thing's my therapist's idea. It's my shrink, really.
Well, you'll have a ball. You seem to have everything everybody wants when they go back. The car, the suit, the watch. The look. That just leaves the little things, like happiness, character, point of view...
Bad experiences.
Unbelievable.
I'll think about it.
Yes.
Okay... Would you rather... commit yourself sexually to a four-by-nine cell with former President George Herbert Walker Bush dressed as a super-model for a month, or make love to a otter on crank for a week?
--She's not dead---
Wow. I have to give this some thought.
No.
I'll hide.
It's in Michigan. Honestly, what do I have in common with those people? Or with anyone?
Why not. I trust you. You couldn't turn me in because of Doctor-Patient privilege... and I don't want to be "withholding"... and I know where you live.
We're both professionals, Oatman.
What stuff?
Effective. But to tell you the truth, I've lost my passion for work.
Like a club. Work less, make more.
We could be working together, making big money, killing important people... I'm willing to let you in on the ground floor.
I didn't get into this business to have "associates." And I don't want to join your Goddamned union. "Loner-- " "Loner gunman." Get it? "On my own." That's the whole point. Why don't you become a cop, or something. You can drink coffee in the morning... with friends!
Fine. But we're not going to let you do your job. Because we're gonna do it. And then, after we do your job, we're gonna do another little job...
I know what I do isn't moral, per se, but if you could just look past that, you'd see a man worth loving.
I guess.
In Portugal, yes.
I don't think so.
Do his job? I'm not a cold-blooded killer.
Yup.
He using her.
No...
This?
It's from one of those P.O. Boxes. How was the trip?
Tell them that's impossible. I need my normal lead time.
It's fine.
Yes. It's the same as usual. Nothing remarkable about it at all.
Okay, call them. Fine. Oh-- And if you could find out why they double- booked the job, and who is trying to kill me, and call me back-- that's be great.
That's wonderful, Mom.
I can't think of anything to say to her that seems appropriate given I left and never said goodbye to her.
Yeah...
I have always thought about her and missed her.
Same thing that happened to you-- I stopped poutin' there on the sidelines. Got in. Got on the team. I joined the working week, you slick fucking asshole, so why don't you valet park your high horse and take it easy on your old buddy, Paul.
You too.
Yeah, but it's still kind of eerie, isn't it?
I was catching up with Bob Destephano.
See you in ten years.
Good evening, Mr. Blank.
Martin, I don't know where you've been since you abandoned my daughter ten years ago, and I don't care. It was good that you left, and I'm glad you did. So what do you want to talk about? You've grown up a bit. Maybe I had you figured wrong.
Oh, you know me, Martin. I'm the same old sell-out baby-boomer, exploiting the oppressed I got shot for at Kent State. But why don't we have a drink and forget the whole thing?
All by yourself?
Oh, I see, you write both sides of the conversation?
A jogger, huh?
It's all right. He's young. Just hold out your hand a little lower so he can get the smell of you.
No, ma'am, I'm afraid that's extra.
You look all right. You want to pick it up a little?
Five years. My son was born here.
That's very important to you, isn't it? Home.
How did you find out all that?
What?!
Annie!
Is that your version of a pep talk?
I think we should. It's not fair to let him suffer. He's not much use anymore. He'd hate living like that.
I mean, I'm not much use anymore. Why can't they be compassionate to me?
He doesn't have to! It's, like, so obvious you can't stand him.
Then why do you want to leave?
Don't they believe in signs here?
... You worried everything all right now and we'll have to go home?
You... not wanting to go home because you hate daddy so much.
LEAVE ME ALONE!!
My period.
What?
Well... honey... you know... that's just not his way. Maybe you can write him a letter or something. Say thank you... Don't think about it... You take care and I'll see you home.
I should be in by two.
That's okay. We have to talk about it and we're not always in the same place ... so... I just have to get used to it.  What do you want to do about dinner?
She was in pretty bad shape. They've done a C.A.T. Scan -- she has some hemorrhaging...
Oh. Right. I'll call him.
I love you.
No. I was just researching. Calm down.
I can't say he's been all that effective with her.
Robert, we're losing her. We're losing her.  I don't care what the doctors say. The truth is, they don't know anymore than we do -- less, when it comes to Grace... This may not sound sensible or... logical, but nobody's suggesting anything better. I can't explain it, Robert. I just have this feeling... this annoying... bloody feeling that if... if, somehow, Pilgrim can be made all right... then so can Grace. I just know it!
She will if you think she should.
Yeah, but nothing I can't handle. Lucy tells me she thinks Gottchalks's plotting, but what else is new.
You're allergic to hay.
You don't have to explain. You have every right to come.
No, it's okay. Believe me, there were plenty of times I didn't know what the hell was right.
Mmm. I made good time.  Pilgrim's in the back. I found a new stable, but they can't take him until tomorrow.
You want to take a walk with me?
Oh, you can just set up on the dining table. I have to rearrange my shelves tomorrow.
I got a little confused though. The ranch Ellen was talking about -- that's not this one?
I'd love to go there one time...
I fell in love. After that, I never thought about being anything but a rancher's wife. I never saw it like I was losing some other life, just felt like I was gaining one. I know that's not a popular opinion nowadays and I ain't saying it's the right one. We all have to find the life meant for us.
Yes, it does.
Promise?
Problem is, there aren't many volunteers. He's already had enough to sink a battleship. You have a pin, just in case?
What?
Diane takes care of the books. I don't know how, but at the end of every month, everything adds up to the penny.
That's what some folks say.
Tell her they suit the weather better. Their udders are black, 'stead of pink.
Yeah.
Our daddy raised Pure Herefords.
I don't think Warren would go for that.
Twice a month they give you a day off to work on the ranch.
I don't thinks you'd want me tripping all over you in front of everybody.
You know, you're a good kid.
She's an editor.
No, you're only going to hurt him some more.
No!
Why don't we just cut through the woods?
OK, OK.
No, I'm just not that hungry.
Maybe... look -- just...
I know. Amazing.
I haven't been back in over twenty years, but I wouldn't be surprised. The population's larger.
Yeah, cool.
It's cool!
...IF it weren't run by a bunch of profiteering gluttons!
Waste the dude.
Look at this, it's so lean and clean.
Stupid, man. It's universally stupid.
I'm gonna hit you!
Yeah, I bet it looks crispy in the dark.
Never send a boy to do a woman's job. With me, we can do it in seven.
No, don't know who he is.  Do you?
Hmmm.
I got it. But listen, Kate didn't know what's on it. I mean, she came to me to figure it out. She's not the one who planted the virus. You leave her alone.
Razor and Blade.
My... class. You mean I'm not in your class?
Pool on the roof must have a leak.
Indeed. RISC architecture is gonna change everything.
I don't do dates. But I don't lose either, so you're on.
Uh, hold on...
I know, I know who wrote it.
I'm trying to help you.
What?
They didn't. The guys felt it was the only way I'd get a date. Anyway, you're pretty good. You're elite.
Right, well my BLT drive on my computer just went AWOL, and I've got this big project due tomorrow for Mr. Kawasaki, and if I don't get it in, he's gonna ask me to commit Hari Kari...
Homicidal?
Red handed! You won't be having any more trouble from them.
What's happening?
As in what, you hapless techno-weenie?
I've narrowed the activity to terminal 23.
Run anti-virus. Give me a systems display!
One more "dude" out of you and I'm gonna slap the shit outa you, okay? Now I'm trying to save you from yourself but you gotta stop letting your mama dress you, man! : Check it...
Nono, it's like hot or something. I don't know.
Yeah. Whose gonna notify his next of kin?
Once again, don't call me Eugene.  A recent unknown intruder penetrated, using a superuser acount, giving him access to our whole system.
Virus?
I created Mister da Vinci so we could call in the Secret Service. So they'd arrest the hacker, sieze his equipment, things that we can't do on our own.
Not everything. But enough to implicate us.
Hello, operator? I'm having trouble dialing a number.
My parents baby-sitter canceled.
So I have to watch Jamie tonight.
My parents are going to come home early tonight.
You don't owe me anything.
No. You son of a bitch!
Brady! Come with us.
Sometime in the night. They probably lost the road in the storm. Come down the embankment. It happens.
Loomis, it's over. Leave it alone.
Look, even if by some miracle Michael is conscience, his muscles would be totally useless.  Give the troopers a chance to search.
It's okay..it's okay.
About what?
How many bodies did you find?
Haddonfield. It's a four hour drive. You can reach me through the local police. If you didn't find him in four hours, I'm sure I will.
If Loomis read memos he's be here. Fortunately his position is more ceremonial then medical. My hope is that he's either transfer, retire, or die.
Drive Carefully.
Al here lost his boy 10 years back.
Got it Earl.
I can't sleep.
I'm sorry I ruined everything. If I wasn't here you could go out.
But I thought you didn't want to go trick-or-treating.
You bet.
In a second.
Real soon, Jamie. Now shh.
I can't.
Everybody's dead. I just wanna go home.
Then we'll be safe?
Hi Jamie.
Its not over yet.
Isn't this all a little paranoid?
Got it Ben.
All right, all right. Its true, what the hell can we do to avoid a repeat of what happened 10 years ago?
All right. Pierce, do it. Lets check on this little girl.
He's been here.
Dear God.
It isn't a man.
Evil.
Be here in a minute.
Right through the kitchen you'll see the basement stairs.  Brady, you know how to use a gun?
Car trouble?
What's going on?
Now you understand?
We did. Fifteen minutes. You totally never showed up.
All right. The Wallaces leave at seven.
I had my mouth full. Couldn't you hear me?
Now you hear obscene chewing. You're losing it, Laurie.
I brought it for Tommy. I figured making a Jack-O-Lantern would keep him occupied.
No, he's not.
Yeah.
Michael's around someplace...
Will you call me tomorrow?
He isn't a man.
No. I thought she'd be home by now. She went to pick up Paul.
Have a good time.
Lonnie Elam probably won't get out of the sixth grade.
Do you believe everything that Richie tells you?
Tommy, Halloween night is when you play tricks on people and scare them. It's all make believe.
And I'm here tonight and I won't let him get to you.
I promise.
What is it, Laurie?
I'm scared...
It's the bogyman, isn't it?
Yes.
There's nothing to be scared of now. Get changed.
You're coming with us...
Hi, Lindsey, this is Paul. Is Annie there?
Of course not.
I notified everybody! Nobody listened.
Your compassion is overwhelming, Doctor.
You don't have to make this harder than it already is.
The only thin that ever bothers me is their jibberish. When they start raving on and on...
Shouldn't we pick him up?
He said something else. "It's all right now. He's gone. The evil's gone."
Come in, come in.
I know.  You're an actress with a great flair for shrimp puffs.
Well, let's hope so.
I mean, I've looked everywhere.
No, really, we mustn't get discouraged.
Oh, it's magnificent!
Yeah.
Uh...
Oh, uh, listen, David called me up.
He wants to take me to see Rigoletto.
Really?  How flattering!  Did you try the shrimp puffs?
Ah! HOLLY  Now.
Yeah, we're the Stanislavski Catering Company.
I'm an architect.
It's terrific!
Right.  Yeah, but Fifth is so jammed, isn't it?
You mentioned on the phone that you'd had some dizziness.
When did you first notice this?
I told him about your work, and he's very excited.
'Cause I got a lot of wall space there. 
We nev-- We don't name names!  We say the Pope.
Oh, I don't know.  My unemployment checks are running out.  Um, I was thinking of taking some courses at Columbia with the last of my savings.
...ex-husband on the street the other day.
What are you doing here?
Oh, I was just going to my AA meeting. ELLIOT Oh, my goodness.  Well, why do you still go to those?  You never tough alcohol.
Well, i-if-if you have some free time...
Well, you sure picked the right place.  I mean, you can stay here all afternoon, not buy anything and just read.
No?
Yes?
Everything's okay? 
Yes, he's just adorable.
Oh, right.
What are you doing?!
Why, you know the situation.
Look, don't do anything on my behalf.  I live with Frederick, and Hannah and I are close.
Oh, please, I have to go.  I have to get my teeth cleaned.
I almost didn't.
I didn't sleep all night.
I promised myself I wouldn't let this happen till you were living alone.  I was so torn when you called.
Oh, not here.  There are too many people around.
It's been nearly a year since our first time and you're still married to my sister, which...I now realize is fine because you're probably much more in love with her than you know.
I know!  I know!
Holly and April, thanks for helping.
Well, I-I don't think it's a very good idea.
Are you angry with me?
Are you in love with someone else?
What kind of interrogation... Su- supposing I said yes?  I-I-I am disenchanted.  I am in love with someone else.
No.
Hannah, my head is throbbing. HANNAH  You never want to talk about it. I-- Every time I bring it up, you- you change the subject.  What is it? Do you-- We're communicating less and less.  You sleep with me less and less.
I am glad to see you.
We were making a commercial down at the mayor's office, and there was this young, good-looking salesman...
So, just 'cause I was born that way... You know, I'm old enough to make a mature decision.
Oh! 'Cause you won't exist!
Yeah, I know.  But never to exist again!
I'm going through a period of my life where I just can't be around people.  I didn't want to wind up abusing anyone.
Lee...  you are the only person I can be with...who I really look forward to being with. 
I don't know.  I thought, maybe I'd move in with my parents for a while.
No.
Who is it?
But who?  Where did you meet him?
You are, you are my only connection to the world!
Jesus...Jesus!
Oh...
You know... 
Hello?
Naturally, I, I--Do you know I--The sudden appearance of a black spot on my back!
No, I was happy, but I just didn't realize I was happy.
Can I tell you something?  Can I tell you a secret?
I know, I know, and your hamster.
You look so beautiful.
You know, how's everything?  You doing okay?  How's Frederick?  I mean, Elliot.
Like what?
I think we need to eat.
I know, she...she really writes good dialogue.
Everything's good.  Everything's fine.
I think he'll find that satisfying.
...you know?  I, uh...
Football!
Well, then a third opinion.
Right.  We felt that if we were gonna do it, that we would like somebody who we knew and who we liked and who was warm and bright and...
Yes, she's lovely, but she doesn't have your spark.  She knows it.  She worships you. She wouldn't dare get up there on the stage.
True.
Someday, I'll pay it all back.
Two thousand dollars.
Hannah, I know it's a lot, but my friend April and I, we have this catering idea I think's going to be great.
Are we talking about cocaine again?
Uh-oh.
Oh!
Singing?
No!  No, I, eh, it's just that they sing.
Well, I just came from an audition...
Yeah, although it's put an end to the Stanislavski Catering Company. Which is why I have to speak to you. And...  you're gonna get impatient, but...I have to borrow some more money. 
But what I decided to do is some writing.  Yeah, I think I've had it with acting.  You know, these meaningless auditions at cattle calls.  And I can't handle another rejection.  Now let's face it here.  I gotta, you know, latch on to something in my life.  You know--something with a future.  I'm not sixteen anymore.  It's just...crazy!  I've got...an idea for a story. More than one.  And I just need a few months, you know, or, uh, a year even.
Look.  Listen.  Listen.  You want to write?  Write.
I, I, my ears are experiencing a meltdown!  I can't hear anything.
Yeah.  Me, too.
...I had a great time tonight, really.  It was like the Nuremberg Trials.
I recall you.
We didn't hit it off.
...just some stuff.  A little of this, a little of that, that's all.
Probably not.
Come on.
Well, yes, I would if, uh, if it would mean anything to you.  I don't know why it would.
Oh, no!  It wasn't anything bad. But she just... you know.  I don't know.
Fabulous, I mean it!  I'm so impressed.
I don't know how you're gonna top that.
Oh...
...which I did not get.
Yeah, okay, right.  Forget it.  What's to eat?
I just want a salad.  You really think I'm a loser, don't you?
...read it over, and think about it.
Tell me about your trip... what did you <u>bring</u> me...?
<u>What</u> is this, a whorehouse, or are you my <u>wife</u>?
Yes?  My <u>promotion</u>...?
I hereby acknowledge that...
I prefer to stay in the Less Frivolous professions.
Let's just say they got a passion for collectibles...
Say it in English.
Then who's buying it?
Rich, comic book freaks.
Because we both know who's buying the Lechteriana.
Mason Verger.  For he cannot be free. Dr. Lechter refashioned his body so it mirrors his soul, what an impossible injustice.  Can <u>you</u> be free....?
All y'got to do is <u>ask</u>... 
I'm not.
...the whole world's out to get you...
M'I gonna see you tonight?
Are you <u>alright</u>...?
...I have never met a man who was so well beloved.
Bad coffee, and women with excessive ankles.
Yes, but we know who it was, and I will tell you, Agent Starling, what you know to be true.  I offered the bounty.  It was illegal, and, worse, it was <u>wrong</u>. And I thank God every day that I did not compound my sinful life by the stain of a murder.  Do you  Agent Starling:  do you know <u>God</u>? 
...are you alright, sir...?
Somewhere in Italy.
...then we won't need to tether Miss Starling as our lure.
Have the child taken to bed.
No.  And...
...yes, if you'll, just step <u>away</u>...
He... would consider it a favor if he could make a <u>donation</u>.  To a charitable institution of your choice. 
He was the orderly, during Dr. Lechter's stay in Prison.
...Mr. Verger would be pleased to make a contribution, to the charitable...
I can make you rich.
...standard issue...
Am I on that case, sir...? 
Well, well, well, well, well, she went <u>in</u> there, to apprehend a Dangerous Felon. Went in there with her gun, Came out, <u>without</u> the Felon, with<u>out</u> the gun...
...she couldn't act on her own..?  Where is the FBI's vaunted Initiative, where..?
I don't <u>think</u> so...
And how do we account for the interest of such a charming man, an interest in Torture?
I have had many excellent meals there.
You have taken over his offices, is that not so?
How so?
I wonder no longer.  You were out of the country.
Take mine.  Ah. And is that your <u>wife</u>...  Signora.  Can it be that you are lovelier, even, than at our last encounter...?
...yes, yes, yes...
She my foster.
We got KittyKat...
Sir, I'm in Law Enforcement, I was out there, dealing with an armed and dangerous...
THEN WHERE WAS IT?  I'm sent out there... I'm told that the <u>arrest</u> must be a joint...
Would that add to your <u>mirth</u>?
Yes, to cease to Hope is the Greatest Crime.  The Greatest crime.  Perhaps the <u>only</u> crime.  <u>I</u> never ceased to hope!
That's what I should do.  Tell me why?
Show'm the FBI <u>Hand</u>shake...
You got a lot of people love you, Starling.
Y'want to gimme Brigham's pistol?
You goin to shoot yourself? 
Why?
Because it is exclusive... because <u>everyone</u> will be here...
Then we cannot go.
Because we cannot <u>pay</u>...
....because we don't have any mmm...
Oh, my <u>program</u>...
Waal, you c'n only get it in one shop in Alexandria Virginia, n'that's where I'm going, cause I'm goin <u>home</u>, f'i can get n'y'one, Of That Nature, to <u>take</u> her there...
I can't remember.  I've got to make some money.
I'm sorry, I don't mean to be impolite. Because, you know, you can't understand.
Well, no...  That's... I appreciate your <u>help</u>, but... 
Yes.
Yes.
...why?
I've come to see you, sir, about an Auction...
<u>Someone</u> offered three million dollars bounty on Dr. Lechter's head. 
I was pretty confident that I was going to blow it with Talia, but I must say, I outdid myself.
Uh, yeah, that's...wow.
Sure, Wichita. Whatever you say...
Hey, I thought I wasn't your type.
Goodnight.
Nothing.
This is not the way it was supposed to-- I was going to start writing a children's book using input from all-- I don't even like smoking!
We need more ritalin. Can't we just grind it into the munchkins' food?
Talia, just because you happen to be Jewish, doesn't mean you can make fun of someone desecrating the Lord's body...
Ooh look, time to confiscate my first water balloon...
Talia, you know how important our friendship is to me and I would never do anything to...
I just never thought of you in that...
So what?                                                    ]
And you'll be happy to know I'm going to drop my Snow White and the Seventy Dwarves act...Not all of it, but...
It's been known to happen.
Do you really think I care?
What do you want me to say?
Hey really, I don't feel so great.
Like last night, Veronica?
All right.
Because you're an idiot.
Color me educated. I learned high school happiness is for members only, Pauline Fleming wouldn't know reality if it lived in her uterus, and reality's name's Heather James. Also, J.D.'s a major creep.
Geez, don't listen to them.
Never say never.
Don't worry. David says he's very so he's very.
Heather, I feel awful, like I'm going to throw up. Can we jam, please?
You goddamn bitch!
Lick it up, baby. Lick. It. Up.
We both said a lot of things we didn't mean, last night.
Yeah, maybe.
Yes. Yes. We'll work something out. I swear to God. Won't we J.D.?...J.D.?
Is she dead?
No.
God, I'm so sure. Don't blame me, blame Heather. She told me to haul your ass into the caf pronto. Back me up, Heather.
Give it up girl!
Yeah, where's your urge to purge?
Hea<u>ther</u>, I've got something going with J.D.
How very.
No, but if you're nice I'll let you buy me a Slurpee. You know your 7-11speak pretty well.
I didn't. Cherry.
I don't know. Should you?
Sure, I'm on my way to a party at Remington University.
Heather Chandler is one bitch that deserves to die.
Just saying it's not hard to end a life.
Man Veronica, pull the plug on that shit. I say we go with Big Blue.
Yeah, great.
"To me though, suicide is the natural answer to the myriad of problems life has given me."
This is the last thing she'll ever write. She'll want to cash in on as many fifty-cent words as poss.
That only proves my point more. The word is a badge for her failures at school.
Oh come <u>on</u>. Lots of people drink Perrier. It's come a long way.
Yeah, but don't worry, it was worth it just to see the look on....
She wants to ignore the high school experience. Our way's better. We scare people into not being assholes.
You kids are making too much damn noise.
I was thinking more along the lines of slitting Heather Duke's wrists open and making it look like a suicide.
I don't get it! You were wrong! I was right! Strength, damnit! Come back!
Nag, nag, nag, nag. nag.
You didn't say Simon Says.
You're not listening. People are going to look at the ashes of Westerburg and say there's a school that self-destructed not because society didn't care, but because that school <u>was</u> society. Is that deep or what? I'll let you put it in your diary, babe. Free of charge.
What did your <u>boyfriend</u> say when you told him you were moving to Sherwood, Ohio?
I guess.
Great pate, but I'm going to have to motor if I want to be ready for the party tonight.
Where is he? Where's J.D.?
Oh, I was scared of the same thing, Heather. The minute you try to deal with the actual teenagers who have contemplated suicide you're stepping into quicksand. Quicksand filled with bad complexions, bad grades, bad parents, bad drugs, and all sorts of doody nobody wants to hear let alone bend down to clean up.
Sure. Ciao.
Are you a carpenter, Mr. Rieper? HERBERT shakes his head.
Actually, Mr. Rieper . . . it's a novel, and we'll be sending it to New York. That's where all the big publishing houses are based.
playfully shoves his hand away.
Look who I've found!
comes in with a breakfast tray: bacon and eggs, tea and toast.
Do you think Juliet could stay here while her parents are away?
grabs Pauline by the shoulders.
She says the standard of your work is slipping. At this rate she doesn't think you'll get School Certificate.
You're failing English . . . you used to be top of the class- PAULINE I'm doing my own writing!
Oh, no. I'm watching my figure.
looks down at the ground in front of her.
Hello, Juliet. Juliet take off her jacket.
Mummy!
It's so beautiful!
You mean travel by ourselves?
Yes . . .
Your mother is a rather miserable woman . . . isn't she?
I think she knows what's going to happen . . . she doesn't appear to bear us any grudge!
Shh. Don't blame yourself Trevor. Please.
The way you just looked at me...
All finished.
I'm stumped.
You were unfaithful, it sounds like your confessing.
Did I ever talk about Kirsty?
Just get better okay?
Trevor things like this happen to people who experience temporary memory loss. Everybody does things they regret. You just couldn't remember doing these things and now you are so it's a shock to the system. I'm telling you. You will never get better if you keep blaming yourself for your wife's death.
Really? Do tell.
What's the occasion?
How much time off?
Someone special.
Tonight was supposed to be the night, Trevor. Remember? I couldn't believe you went through five dart games and didn't even joke about it.
I said she's been missing for-
What's that?
Nothing, look. Gwen I really like you-
In a word? Lucrative.
For me? Trevor! How romantic! Come here, you.
Where's my wife?
I did read that, yes.  What hospital were you going to? I mean the Lodovico Street Bridge isn't exactly on the way to Mercy General.
No please make yourself at home.
What?
I don't even know what's real and what isn't how can I trust anyone?
I surrender...
Surrender yourself... surrender yourself...
Hey even if it is more power to ya.  Alrighty then. Have a good time.
Well now there's a compliment.
Come on, quit fucking around. Listen it's about... what we did together last night.
I sell them at the recycling center. Gives me a little for gas and food.
Talk from there.  You can talk from there.
Same with me, pretending I was you. An impulse.  Why not?  I had this shoe.
Y-you're a g-god damn saint, John.
I think our best course right now would be to focus on the Probation Officer's report...
We can hope.  You still have your job, right?
And a son by your ex-wife?  Joseph.
How recently?
"Angel!"  I didn't say "angel," that's a little strong.  Listen, here's the thing, I gotta get over there to the TV station to collect my million bucks.
I took a loan on my car and my computer.
I was inspired by the hero, how he stuck his neck out for others, how he took a chance...
Well, as you like to point out, Mister LaPlante, I'm relatively inexperienced.  My naivete may have worked to your benefit in this instance.
I can't afford no better.  My ex, she attached my pay check for child support payments.  You looking for Bernie LaPlante by any chance?
The thing about kids is, they're so... young!  They don't know nothin' yet.  When you're a kid, you think you're gonna grow up an' be a "wonderful person" instead of an asshole, like everybody else.
You couldn't have a problem, Chick, because I personally have got them all.  I cornered the whole goddamn market.  You wouldn't believe... Oh, how ya doin'...?
You mean like Bubber?  The hero?
THAT'S IT!  YOU TALKED!  YOU'RE FIRED!  OUTTA HERE!  GET OUTTA HERE!
I DON'T CARE ABOUT <u>YOUR</u> PROBLEMS, I'M GONNA THINK ABOUT <u>MY</u> PROBLEMS. <u>YOU'RE</u> ONE A MY PROBLEMS.  GET OUT! OUT!  OUT!
Why doncha let me in so we don't wake everybody in the neighborhood?
I had to explain your tendancy to "exaggerate", How you were actually "in country" all of two weeks and how you killed about as many people as the other clerk-typists in your outfit, no more, no less...
Back to the jungle, Bernie.  Good night.
Me!
Yes, everybody <u>is</u> in love with John Bubber.  The whole country, in fact. And they're not going to be happy if he jumps to his death because he was harassed by a lousy little money-grubbing low-life fence...
In all that smoke and fire, John had a moment of weakness.  He'd been down and out, destitute, living in his car.  It was just an impulse, stealing my purse.
I'm going to apologize to Bubber?
Lie, you mean...
I got a kid, you know.  I'm a person, for Chrissake.
Who am I?  You're asking me?  You're the big expert for Chrissake!  I'm what?  The "Scumbag," right?  The sleazebag something or other, the blackmailer, the...
Sometimes.  His name's Elliot.  He saved a guy's life one time.  In a fire.
Were you in it?  In the war?
John, I'm sure she could support just about anything.  I think I'll see you to your room. A sort of bodyguard.  Make sure no harm comes to you.
It's no big deal, it just <u>looks</u> better carrying me.  Oh, you mean because I wasn't carrying my purse at the time.
Maybe, maybe not.  I have a feeling this guy is important somehow.
You're lucky, Chucky, you... OW!
And sold it to Mister LaPlante, the fence, who's now trying to blackmail poor John.
She's flying to New York.  She's been nominated for a Silver Mike...
She's talking to him now.
She can't quit.
For ten more minutes they love him, Wally.  I'm sick of him and I'm always about ten minutes ahead of the public.
An hour after...!  Deak, for Heaven's sake!  Let's give her a night in New York City.  We'll put her and her boyfriend up at a good hotel...
What about?
Call him back.  Ask him.  I'm a little...busy.
Nobody stole my credit cards.  They burned up in the crash.  Which reminds me, did you get me cash? And what about the reservations?
They're really white.
Isn't that always the way?
An occupational hazard, I'm afraid.
I was alone a lot as a child.  No one to compete with.  My parents ensured that I found happiness in the smallest things.  When you're all alone it's your own world, you don't have to take orders from anybody.  You don't necessarily believe the stories people tell you.
Can I tell you tomorrow?  I think I...
Uh huh.
Listen, I'm sorry, but it's really late -- you don't have to come tomorrow to work on the floor.
I think we should talk first.
"Find a penny, pick it up, all day long you'll have good luck!"
"We don't want to be late for our first day of school."
The pocket's a cinch -- I'll sew it up for you after dinner, okay?
He's staying with a friend.  Hurry up now, you'll be late for school.
That's okay, Mom.
Neil, don't leave the back doors open -- I don't want Holly near the pool.
What?
You wanted furniture too, didn't you?
It's very nice, but it's still a little pricey for us.
Damn.
Honey, the meeting today is going to be fine.  Don't get in an uproar.
It's just a dumb game they play. You want to be at a bigger firm, get used to the politics.
He's made some friends, hasn't he?
I don't care, Philip.  You want to go chasing Barbara Zelman, go ahead.  Just watch out for those buck teeth.
Fuck you, Philip.
Yeah -- she did a good job.  This glass looks brand-new.
I'm having the floor fixed,
There's always an excuse, isn't there?
We'll talk in the morning.
Sometimes they prefer a quicker return on their investment.
Two -- three if you count the husband.
Shut up.
Grow up, Dreyer.
Would you mind if Rudolf had a look too?
And I can't help having a cold.
-- A man.
Oh yeah?  Where's the bed?
Even cosier.
No joke, Lieutenant.
No.  I don't scare easy.
You didn't bring me here to talk about her.
Lieutenant, you're really frightening me.
Hey -- somebody want to gimme a hand here?
There will be more to the prize than that.  Power will come with it -- and it must be used for good.
Aye -- yet one such as I who has wandered this world for nearly nine centuries can remember back to other days of change.  Days of Robin of the Hood and Arthur Pendragon.  They were real enough once, but they drifted into men's dreams and became legend - - as we shall do one day.
What?
Are you always this pleasant?  You know what you're problem is?
And what do you think you will find in another land?
For what?
I'm sure they will.
If it came down to it what would you do?
Me?  Of course.
It's done.
No -- after you.
The past?
Where I'm going you cannot follow.
Because, it's for the best.  There are somethings that are better left unexplained.
What are you hoping to find inside?
No -- we're from Strange facts and mysteries.  It's a syndicated show out of..
Are you a cop?
What do you want?
Then how did he know your name?
New York is dangerous place.
About what?
You look like you have.
Why?  Because I don't give up all my secrets?
A little -- yes.  My interest in coming here is profession.
Yes -- it is.
If they pushed the rocks you would have found them on the other side of the cavern wall.
We'll see.
It's not been long enough.  What witchcraft is this?
It does not come off as easily as the young ones.
This cannot be.
That's what the Kurgan said.
Me too.
Aye -- that I would, lass.
Get to work.
Chief...it's like none of this exists. I'm sorry.
What do you want to do?
I'll make the call.
Am I talkin' raghead?!  I want your car! <u>Gimme the goddamned keys</u>!
Shut up, goddamnit!  Just calm down!
We're on foot.  We can't get away.
Are you totally stupid?  What does it look like?
For chrissake, <u>please</u>!  Help me celebrate!  I figured it out!
What are you talking about?
You don't have to explain shit!  That Chinaman pulled a gun.  We wrestled for it.  That Chinaman shot himself.
The Mexican police would arrest you as soon as it landed.  There's only one way out and you're doing it right now--just keep talking to us.  I think we could make the transition now. Maddox, you good to go?
I'm going to put on an officer named Will Maddox.  You talk to him for a while.
I need you to let me talk to Mr. Smith.
Fuck that!  You bastards will jump me!
You'll cap my ass as soon as I step out the door!
Only if you try to grab me.  We could've shot you from the wall.
Two hundred thousand cash, right in your pocket, no one needs to know.
There's a million dollars in there, maybe <u>two</u> million.  I'll give you half.
Give up, Dennis.  Let these people go. At least you'll have your life.
Aw, Jesus, not more of this.
Okey-doke.
I don't eat junk food.
Goddamnit, tell me what you <u>know</u>.  Did the cops go in?  Did Smith have the disks?
I also have a couple of million in cash. Call Sonny Benza.  Ask if I can keep it.
Yeah.
You said they would be here, goddamnit! Where are they?
Where is it?
I'm in no rush.  Maybe later we can talk.
That's okay.  I love you anyway.
Go!  If you get out, maybe you can help the police!
I don't drink beer.
Keep your voice down.  I'm taking you and your brother out of here.
What are you doing?!  Stop that!
Another minute.  Please --
What's that, Chief?  Say again.
You have her cell number?
Could you call me back on your phone? Right away.
Laura Martin.  This is Will Maddox, the primary negotiator --
I've done it once or twice.  I blocked their phones to incoming calls, so you'll have to cut in a hard line to talk to him.
Did the boy say that any of them are in immediate danger?
You've been here all day, Chief.  Take a break.  See your family.  If I need you, I'll call.
We're okay.
If I try to climb out they'll see me on the security cameras.  They would see you outside, too --
The doctors are taking care of him right now.  Thomas . . . are you safe?  Can you talk?
I need your help with something.  But if you think those guys could catch you, then I don't want you to do it, okay?
Your dad has two computer disks.  They have funny names:  Marlon and Al.
I thought they locked you in your room.
I'm the Chief.  I don't carry it.
You want . . . Marlon and Al.
That's what I came to talk to you about.
No. I work at the Mille Collines.
I don't have it here. At the Mille Collines. I can get it for you.
You want to buy anymore cockroaches ask for Captain Naramunju.
We're awaiting a decision, excuse me.
Yes, Colonel Monsieur Xavier, the Minister of Finance.
Yes sir, but these people  they cannot stay here. I've heard you have a refugee center at the airport Stadium?
What's happening?
That explains it. I'm sorry to tell you this but we've heard rumors the Militia are getting ready to storm the hotel.
The rebels have fought their way into the city. They have many Hutu prisoners.
No. We have no way of finding other stock but I have money for you from the guests.
If you do not help me, you will stay on that list.
Who will tell them? You need me to tell how you helped the hotel. The others who have gone, they blame you for all their misfortune. They say you led the massacres.
I will do nothing unless you help me now.
Go! What the fuck sort of journalists are we, running from a war? I'm ashamed. Are you? Well, are ya'?
Just give me a moment to get your keys.
I don't have to listen to you anymore.
Please, except my humblest apologies...
I am delighted to see you, Mr. Daglish.
I'm sorry, Mr. Daglish, this is the Mille Collines. No working girls here.
Take it for Christ sake. I wish it was a fucking aeroplane.
Yes, sir. What is wrong?
What?
No, no. This is a very dangerous part of town. I cannot do this.
I need one last favor. Go back and get the twins.
Of course.
Homework?
I couldn't help.
Murdered! By whom?
Please. Let them stay 'til morning. The militia will not come here, they know you are a Hutu with influence.
Get in.
I will not have them on my conscience. They will stay in my room.
No answer. Please send someone to get them, please.
He needs to be in a safe place.  Have you heard from Mr. Garindi?
What for Paul.
So where is the lamb?
No, no.
A kiss.
What was the bribe?  What am I worth to you?
What sort of car?
I'll try but we have to leave, with or without them. I want you to promise.
We are almost out of everything.
Please do not talk like this.
What's wrong?
Thank you, sir, you saved our lives.
Why?
What's wrong?
Boss, some of those men are my neighbors, they know I'm Tutsi.
Sir, no one wants to work. They say the boss has left.
Simon has a new pet. Can I go see it?
What is his room number?
I'm confused.
And what's Steven's status?
No. I'm going back to try and find Ms. Marr. If she's hurt, I'll tend to her. Dead, then I'm coming back for him.
Well, until that's found, I think it's a good idea we all stick together.  Or wouldn't that fit into your plans, baby?
Accidents. Fatal. Each of your prior wives, so we've been informed.
-- she's not dead! Just have to get her heart pumping aqain!
Didn't catch his or her name, just followed them down here. Somebody all in white surgical gown.
I think one of you has been part and parcel of making this situation!
Yeah, me too.
Nothing.
It's not going to let us out!
Pritchett, you're not joining this necktie party?
I thought she was dead. For sure.
Why?
Maybe there are notes or drawings of this place, showing how those plates work.
We're safe?
I don't do groups.
Which part of that fantasy turns you on most: me with other men -- or just the other men?
Really? Well, let it rip.
Where is she?
-- being utterly fucking useless, what else is new.
I've designed and built six of these places -- take my word for it, everything's fine.
-- my loss --
I think, Pritchett, we've got a situation here that even you can't explain away as "ghosts." This is ice- cold homicide by person -- or persons --
Very good. Well, I think I can say with complete honesty: I've never heard of any of you.
-- I wouldn't worry, Ms. Jenzen: the unexplainable will probably explain herself before too long. In the meantime, let's all relax, have a drink, the evening's young --
Then just wait -- maybe this whoever's got you next on the Asylum's equipment- test list. Maybe a literal mind-blow inside the "Saturation Chamber."
Well, I can't, sweetheart.
Evelyn, go stir your cauldron or something for a sec.
What's going on?
The basement -- but, believe me, you don't want to go down there.
Not ghosts... at least not what you're thinking... Vannacutt used to dump the bodies of his failed experiments somewhere in the house...
Keep talking, I'll find you!
It might have been her mother.
So was I.  The usual investigation turns up nothing more times than not.
Why don't you pass me your plate?
A few years older, perhaps.
I'm sorry.
That poor little girl.
No it won't - no it won't!
I'm scared!
Where is she now?
Ok.  If you want this room, you can have it.
He's blessing the house.
Fight it back Aubrey.  Fight it back as hard as you can!
Daddy help!
Who knows...  we have to get used to living around here.  Maybe good help is hard to find.
I just, I don't know...
Aubrey knows more about us than you think.
What?
She's asleep.  I think that's what I need, too. I'm starting to see things.
Were you fooling with the power?
So what are you saying?
You, an imaginary friend.  That's what she calls her.
She's gone!
Aubrey!
Should I...
We're not going.
No...  NO!
I'm all right...
We're usually successful in detecting the source of most problems.  Unfortunately.
Maura.
White meat will be fine...
Yes, I am.
It was a shame.
What!
Why?
So what should we do, father?
What are you getting at!
So is that what all this is? Someone have a problem with us living here?
Jesus Christ ...
No.  Not on station time.  My story.  My time.
You wanted a story.  You got it.  Turn on the TV now.  And then get your ass down here ...  ...
Correct.  The fields of France.  And many dead flowers ... Oh.  Forgive me. My name was Spenser.  Elliott Spenser. Captain.
The Box, Joey.  He wants the Box.
Where?
It's okay.  It's just someone burned me once.
Did you know him?
Taken what?
Wait a minute.  He was already ... wounded ... when you found him?
Wait.  Wait.  The chains.  Where did the chains come from?
Guys.  Sometimes friends.  Mostly guys.
Woah.  Wait a minute.  Who?  The kid?
Would you know this store again?
Then you shouldn't even be around it. You know, it's ...
Fine.  Fine.  But can you tell us anything about it?
What else came with it?  Anything still here?
You're JP Monroe, right?
Thank you for the drink.  And the rose. Wow.  That's ... really nice.
A prize?  For what?
I'm sorry.
No.  Really?
Oh.  Like I'm not an interesting person.
Good.  So did I.  And that's all ...
Will you relax?  Your little girlfriend left a card, remember?
That's so good to hear, sweetheart.  It really is. You know, I .. are you alone?
C'mon.  It'll be great.
Yeah, a girl I know helped smarten it up.  Put her heart and soul into it.
Not now, no.  I mean - now that you're here, it's like she doesn't even exist, you know what I mean?
No.  It isn't ... she wouldn't ... It's like I must have done something wrong, you know?  Freaked her out.  Just fucked up something good again.
Something like that.
It doesn't have to be.  Everybody knows that if you mess with the Kremlin, you'll end up in a Siberian gulag eating your own fingernails.
Oh man, you still got a thing for those unmasculine European coffees? Who's your buddy?
Ah, had the perfect amount of foam.  Just get me to the bar... It's the one good thing in my life that'll never change....
No need.  Guards' station's right there.
Oh, not much.  Gates just had his tonsils taken out.  The hard way.
Ah yes, a rare Renaissance piece. Da Vinci's "Sforza," an equestrian model of a never executed statue. I consider it to be the prize of tonight's auction of objets d'equestrian.  Horse things.
Morning edition.  Seems two thieves "attempted" to steal it last night, but thanks to three "courageous" guards, it will be ready for tonight.
You re not thinking of going to...
Why not just go now?
"Maybe we're ragged and funny."
Let's just forget it, I mean...
Close call, but she's our only way of keeping tabs on that damn mysterious Vatican organization. Hawk, it's time to go to the principal's office....
A little petting is not the issue!
Oh, why couldn't I be the Cardinal in charge of catering.... If the Mayflowers get the three sections of Da Vinci's crystal and his instructions for the gold machine-- Aie-yi--Do we got anything?  What of Alex, Hawk's friend, where is his loyalty?
God go with you, sister.
I don't steal stuffed elephants from little girls.  And I buy my own clothes.  My life's a little boring...
I'll bring my entire repertoire...
Somebody robbed the Vatican.
Does everyone in the world know more than me?  Jesus, I'm just some guy who happens to be good at swiping stuff.....Lifted a piece of licorice when I was one and a half.  Who knew it would lead... They even got the CIA involved!
You know, the place where you gave the bad guys the Codex.... the Mayflower Museum.
Uh, yeah.  Guess I'm a wee bit nervous.  I'm sorry I could only score clergy passports.
I told you not to call me Hudson. The only people who called me that were the nuns at...
Trust Leonardo....
Oh Lord.... the only reason I ask is that Hudson, uh, Mr. Hawk, Hawkins, had some "neat" things to say about Darwin, Minerva, and you. Basically that you're part of the same car pool.
If the Mario brothers weren't Jersey's third largest family, I'd say kiss my ass.  But considering your status, I'll say slurp my butt.
Listen Hawk, this might be hard to believe, but I'm a regular joe.  I just want to be happy and happiness comes from the achieving of goals. It's just when you make your first billion by the age of 19, it's hard to keep coming up with new ones.  But now finally I got my new goal.  World domination.  With your help...Bunny....quit that!
We're here to say, your government was right.
Whatever.  You own Boardwalk, you own Park Place, you own the four railroads.  You think you're God. For all I know, you're probably right.  I just wanted to have a damn cappuccino, maybe play some Nintendo after I find out what it is.  Man, why didn't you just <u>buy</u> the horse?  What am I saying, you did buy it...
I guess that's a no.
How was I supposed to know they were women?  Besides one of them was bald and kept saying "Soitinly."
For God's sake, chain this convict.
If you think you're getting past me...
You can't, convict!  You're just a shmoe!  Every shmoe has the fantasy the planet revolves around them.  It rains, car crash stops traffic, you say "How could this happen to me?"  It's a natural inclination.  But for I, this isn't a fantasy, it is <u>reality</u>! You are on my planet!  You walk around the corner for coffee, out of my sight, you do not fucking exist!  The lives of shmoes like you have meaning only in relation to the rich, to the powerful, to ME!
Good news, bud, the Mayflowers have moved up the time-table. You're hitting the Vatican to-night.
Too bad.
I used you as a diversion.  while you were getting captured upstairs, I was shredding documents in the basement.  Deep down, I guess I was just jealous.  You were one incredible thief...
I don't tell no one nothin' lessen they ask. Thatches ain't ole Moses' way.
It's hardly the same --
Yeah.
But, Al, it's the bunk! Norville showed me his design for the whatsit the day I met him! Why Buzz couldn't have invented it -- look at the man -- he's an imbecile!
You've lost it, Aim. You've gone soft by the looks of it -- soft on the dummy from Dubuque --
I don't want to bore you with all the sordid details of my life; it's not a happy story...
Oh, Buzz is pretty harmless, really --
Mind if I join you?
Of course -- I went to the Muncie, uh, Secretarial Polytechnic!
Go on, tell the truth; I trust you and I put a lot of stock in your opinion.
Oh sure, you're biased -- you're a fellow Muncian. But would an imbecile come up with this?
Yeah, you know. Probably dresses in men's clothing, swaps drinks with the guys at the local watering hole, and hobnobs with some smooth talking heel in the newsroom named Biff or Smoocher or...
I bet that's exactly what she tells herself! But you and I both know she's just a dried-up bitter old maid. Say, how about you and I grab a little dinner and a show after work? I was thinking maybe The King and I --
Let me hold it, or you'll have a real shiner.
You know, on farm route 17.
Every year?
Well, the Hindus say -- and the beatniks also -- that in the next life some of us will come back as ants. Some will be butterflies. Others will be elephants or creatures of the sea.
Well yes, we're pruning away some of the dead wood, but if --
Know about it? You think the Board would do anything like this without my authorization? No, this was my idea from the start.
Now, Aim --
Consider this my resignation --
I don't know...
You're fools, both of you! It's obvious they're out to crucify Norville! They're trying to destroy him!
This I know, Benny.
It's the most beautiful t'ing I ever saw.
I like to think so! It's this little idea I been working on!
And don't call me buddy! Out of here! Out!
Buzz... off! Ha-ha-ha-ha!
Nah, that's all forgotten.
Huh? Oh, geez, Mr. Hudsucker, I apologize, there was an awful lot of excitement and I guess I must've mislaid --
-- tough titty toenails!
That must have been quite a disappointment, Mrs. Mussburger.
Well, I'm a college graduate --
Well, I made the dean's list.
Sir! They voted me most likely to succeed!
Oh my God, sir!
Lobby. We haven't got all day.
-- So if you think it's appropriate, I'd like to bounce the idea off a few people at lunch --
Sure, sure, it's a tough course. Well thanks for coming, kid. I thought the board room would be a swell place to chat undisturbed -- it seems we're having some security problems here at the Hud.
Yeah, tell me about it.
There's one in every story.
The mark notices.
I know, miss.  But I like to do it. I like to tend for Miss Jessica and I want to tend for you.  You settle right back, now, and I'll mix you your coffee.
We'll see if we can't make her well, Alma, you and I.
Ti-Misery?  What's that?
Nonsense, child!  I know Wesley's been drinking too much lately.  I know a great deal more about what goes on at Fort Holland than you'd think.  I know all about you -- that you're a nice girl, competent and kind to Jessica.  The Fort needs a girl like you.  But now we've got to get you back there.  I'll walk you back and stay over night.  It'll be a nice change for me.
That's sweet of you, Mrs. Rand.
Of course.  It's been nice of you to spend this much time with me.
It'll wait.
By a curious coincidence, it's my day off, too.
Higher mathematics.  Two ounces to a drink -- three drinks, six ounces.
Wait. I want to listen.
Did you hear what he sang?
A woman crying?  No one's been crying here.
I am not a frightened girl.
If I were as timid as you seem to think, Mr. Holland, I wouldn't have gone into the tower in the first place.
Of course not!
But for Wes -- it must be a temptation to him.
You have deliberately endangered Mrs. Holland's life.  There's no telling what you may have started with this insanity.  Why did you do it?
Because you wanted to give my wife back to me?  Why should that mean anything to you?
She was beautiful.
How do you know I'm not?  I was cruel to Jessica.  When I got to know her -- when I found out how empty and ungenerous she was, there was something about her -- something smooth and false -- that made we want to hurt her.
No.  It's not just how I felt toward Jessica.  I've been cruel to even you.
But I had no thought of harming her.  It wasn't I...
Why?
Got a meeting uptown.
Well, hey, isn't that a one-in-a million coincidence. A real dreamer, Jim Williams, eh?
No thank you. We should be off.
So maybe you'll come too?
It's you Ben who needs to talk. I've had my say, and I'm waiting to hear back from you.
Well, it is a neighborhood tradition.
So early?
Hmm. Good night.
Oh. Sure, I -- Did you remember to pick up the cranberry sauce?
I do. I'm -- are you...?
I'm just sad Ben -- I mean it was... you were, but, you know. I just don't know...
See for yourself.
Listen, Elena, if you're gonna pull that passive aggressive stuff on me again --
Sure I do. Do I know what loneliness feels like? Sure I do. I know a lot about it, if that's what you mean.
In the car.
Yeah, well, if we'd understood we could have invented some kind of excuse. A key party -- did you see how stuffed that bowl was already?
I'm not staying at this party so we can go home with someone else's wife. That's not why we're here, right? We're simply being neighbors here, and I think we should do just that --
Yeah.
Stay out of trouble.
You're boring me. I have a husband. I don't particularly feel the need for another.
Have I noticed anything? I'm not married to her Benjamin, you are. I think you've probably a better vantage point from which to observe her.
Birth control.
Don't bullshit me around, Janey. Jesus Christ, I waited around for more than half an hour, in nothing but my boxer shorts, and -- and what's all that about? What the hell happened?
What?
Nah.
Nothing.
Jesus all right enough!
Yeah.
That's besides the point.
That's besides the point. The point is if I'd had any sense in me I'd have divorced your mother 40 years ago, and that's the truth, and here it is, 1972 --
It was lovely!
Let me.
Maybe you just need -- look, can you wait here a sec, I need to tidy up -- just a minute, I'll be right back. You'll wait?
Nobody.
Mom. Are you ok?
Just bundle up. It's supposed to freeze tonight. We'll see you in the morning.
Social work?
Yes.
That's right.
Man, Francis, you are one drug addled elitist freak, and when the revolution comes I do not want to be lined up with you and shot, 'cause you're fucking ripe for political reeducation, you know, like in the fields.
I gotta get to English class.
Do what?
Um, Libbets Casey.
Francis. You gonna leave the seeds in there? In the binding like that?
Moisture! Moisture!
Yeah, Paul, are you gonna get home okay?
Sorry honey. Hell, we've got to trade this thing in for a normal bed.
You notice anything with Mikey lately? The kid seemed a little out of it tonight, eh?
It's like very positive, and I feel a real special feeling, because you really --
Yeah, well, you've been in love with like every other girl here, I was wondering when you'd get around to Libbets.
They did it last year too. It's like traditional or something. They've got this humongoid Park Ave apartment and she just holes up there with a wad of cash.  Aren't the hugely wealthy sad?
Yeah?
I'm not good at math. Just geometry.
I dunno. I --
Wendy!
Yeah.
Why don't you use the phone downstairs?
Libbets? What kind of a name is Libbets?
Charles, what time is it?
The ones you built?
I have to go to the bathroom.
What are you doing?
Mike's out -- I think he went to Silver Meadow to see if you were hanging around there.
That's nice. Are you drunk?
Maybe you could drive him to Spencer's.
I had him!
Too bad...
The Puffins and the Hawks.  We're in extra innings.  The Hawks have a really good line-up this year.
Twelve years younger.
Then change it.
Worth pursuing?
Don't worry.  I'll have a cool scar.
What I saw?
No.
And something else that might interest you.
How do you mean?
When's that, a week?  Two weeks?...  We have to figure out a plan of action now.
To do nothing.
Cut some kind of a deal.  I heard that's what Flynn's doing...
No.  He didn't say what his name was. Only that you were expecting him.
That's not what he thinks.
What is it?
The other guy?
Must be tough for you.  What happened.
Thought you wanted something fun...
Who?
What was it?
Yes down at the station.
Did you have sex with her?
Kay told me.  She comes to me, you know. Tells me things.  About you.  About me.
Yes, and very beautiful.
Nothing if not vampires...
Listen to me.
Your lover.
Lestat! You knew Lestat!
Yes you are, my dearest. You are mine and Louis' daughter. You see Louis was going to leave us. He was going to go away. But now he's not. He's going to stay and make you happy.
What night? What do you mean?
You dress me like a doll. You make my hair like a doll. Why?
It will grow back again!
Stop her Louis!
You're a liar. But you upset my plans.
Yes. It killed them, unfortunately. But it keeps the blood warm.
Claudia - don't -
Don't mock me, Louis. Help me.
It is! Take the back stairwell -
Not yet.
Still my beautiful child.
It was something hurries...and seldom savoured... something acute that was quickly lost. It was the pale shadow of killing.
Claudia, you torture yourself.
You are more beautiful than any of them.
Be still!
So you felt it too!
Your evil is that you cannot be evil! And I will suffer for it no longer!
Yet you could do it to me! Snatching me from my mother's hands like two monsters in a fairy-tale! Couldn't you have waited? Six more years and I would have had that shape! And now you weep! You haven't tears enough for what you've done to me.
And a beautiful house it is too. Yours is a good life, isn't it?
Why should I be?
I want a woman.
We can live like this? Off the blood of animals?
But how do you know?
Come the New Orleans then. There's an opera on tonight. A real french opera! We can dine in splendour!
NO!!!
In the old world, they called it the dark gift, Louis. And I gave it to you.
Is God merciless? Greedy and cruel?
Don't worry, Louis, you're conscience is clear. You left her alive.
CLAUDIA!!!
Don't try to speak... it's alright...
That's all past, Lestat.
So much the better. I've got a pocket full of tapes.
Saw you in the street outside. You seemed interesting. Is this where you live?
So shall we begin?  What do yo do?
Absolutely. I was watching you watching me. I was waiting for you in that alleyway. And then you began to speak.
We love it. I only wanted to prepare you.
The same way you do it. A series of simple gestures. Only I moved too fast for you to see. I'm flesh and blood, you see. But not human. I haven't been human for two hundred years.
You're not lying to me, are you?
He was dead to us. We were free. That was all that mattered.
Peasant rumours, superstitions about garlic, crosses, stakes in the hear, all that - how do you say again? Bull shit. But one of our kind? Not a whisper.
Fictions, my friend. The vulgar fictions of a demented Irishman... So we repaired to Paris...
He hadn't even been there. And all those years I thought he was dead.
It's over, I'm telling you...
My daughter...
July fourth weekend. Storm season starts today. The clouds roll in like clockwork.
Built in 1948 for a member of the Rockefeller clan. The tile work was imported from Spain. A lot of history in these walls...Judy Garland stayed here...Hemmingway fished for marlin right off that dock --
Phones went down a few minutes ago.
Idiot. Idiot. Idiot.
Stupid. What were you thinkng?
No.
Up-tighteous and self-righteous.
No. When I put these skinny pants on my body...Now, that's heart attack time.
No.
I will, and you remind me of the same thing.
Yes.
Just kidding.
Only he wasn't dead. He killed Barry and Helen last July Fourth.
Rio isn't the capital of Brazil. It was the wrong answer. Sorry, we lose.
We'll be better off in the open. If we stick together, maybe we can kill this creep for good.
Oh...it's not working right. You're home early.  Did I scare you?
Tyrell, you are an unstoppable force of nature.
To get out of Southport?
Hey, you don't have to appologize to me. I'm the one. I understand.  I'm going to take a walk and dry off.
It's in my room!
Me, me, me. It's always about you. I'm having bad dreams. I can't sleep. I'm not doing well in school. I'm having trouble with my boyfriend.
Where there's a Will, there's a way. Come on.
Honey, some folks just can't fly.
Somebody's gone tropical on us, baby. Tropical!
Baby, I finally got you alone in this Jacuzzi and I don't wanna be discussin' hair care.
I'd hate for you to have to blow...your whistle.
He's probably the only one who can help us.
How'd you like to win a Magic 96.7 Quicky Getaway?
No. I shot him.
How's the water?
You don't have to be a jerk.
Yeah, wait right here, it's the safest place.
She's in her room.
This is General Nikolas Pherides, Commander of the Third Army. I'm Oliver Davis.  To be perfectly frank with you, we didn't expect to find anyone living here.
In case you do so, would you --
Good winds and bad winds!
I just came to see if your prayer would entertain me as much as my medicine seems to amuse you.
I must meet him with laughter - with songs and laughter -- to show him I am not afraid --
This was once a cemetery.
All the graves?
We will know when the next one sickens.  Until then you and I remain here. I will not bring the plague to my troops.
That was my companion. She sings little peasant songs quite nicely -- a completely untrained voice, of course.
M~ father will take care of it.  Pappa is wonderful! No matter what happens, he makes me feel perfectly safe.  I could never leave him. I should be utterly helpless by myself.
I think not.
No, that's Thea's bed. Miss Wollsten's bed is in there.
Thea is an orphan.
What an odd question!
Why, I love my father because - because I do. Of course, he's nice to me.
My last name is Pherides.
That should decide it or you --
That your father and I ——
If you should fall sick we'll be careful. You need not worry.
Never fear -- when you are dead you will remain dead. I will see to it that you do not walk about again. I promise you that. There is another one here who can not die. I will watch you both. Never fear.
I heard the same sound at Ladysmith, at Nukden, Port Arthur.  What do you expect after a battle?
It doesn't seem to bother you much, General.
Oh, now —— now look here ——
We have no time for that.
In a way -- this girl, Thea. You must stay away from her.
Not Theodosia. Theodosia's daughter -- your daughter.
He keeps asking for the name of my father and mother.
Are you running a business or a charity ward?
How would you like to get a ticket next week? Haven't you any romance in you?
Who?
What are you, a mind reader or something?
Well, who are you, then?
I said I wish I'd never been born.
Well, I had a car, and it was right here. I guess somebody moved it.
You'll see a lot of strange things from now on.
No wonder you jumped in the river.
Why? Don't they believe in angels?
What do you mean, I wasn't there? I remember distinctly . . .
Don't you understand, George? It's because you were not born.
Yes, George?
Oh, well, I can't . . .
Where is she?
Sit down? What are . . .
Oh, I forgot. You haven't got your wings yet. Now look, I'll help you out. Concentrate. Begin to see something?
That's him when he was twelve, back in 1919. Something happens here you'll have to remember later on.
That's the best part of it. They've appointed George here as executive secretary to take his father's place.
Hiya, George!
Oh, look at this. Champagne!
All right.
Get over what? I don't take in strangers unless they're sent here by somebody I know.
That's a lie. He's been in the insane asylum ever since he lost his business. And if you ask me, that's where you belong.
Oh, this afternoon. I thought I'd give the kids a treat.
Goodbye, Sam.
All in . . .
Hope you enjoy it.
No. No.
Still after that first million before you're thirty.
You see what I mean, don't you, Pop?
Say, where's Mother?
Hiya, Marty. Well, it's old home week.
What's that?
Oh, yeah, yeah.
She was here first.
No, no, no, no! Anchor chains, plane motors, and train whistles.
Well, how do you do. Congratulations. Congratulations. What am I doing?
Now you just turn this way and go right straight down.
And then I got scared, George, and closed the doors. I . . . I . . . I . . .
Have you put any real pressure on those people of yours to pay those mortgages?
You like it? I'll send you a box.
What is it –– a woman, then? You know, it's all over town that you've been giving money to Violet Bick.
That so? Well, I'll tell him. Hey, that sounds great! Oh, baby, I knew you'd come through. Now, here's the point. Mary, Mary, you're in on this too. Now listen. Have you got any money?
Well, now listen. I want you to put every cent you've got into our stock, you hear? And George, I may have a job for you; that is, unless you're still married to that broken-down Building and Loan. This is the biggest thing since radio, and I'm letting you in on the ground floor. Oh, Mary . . . Mary . . .
Oh, no, don't. I love that old house.
In that place?
I wouldn't live in it as a ghost. Now watch . . . right on the second floor there.
Well, then you could swallow it and it'd all dissolve, see? And the moonbeams'd shoot out of your fingers and your toes, and the ends of your hair.  Am I talking too much?
Yeah, so I noticed. Have you made up your mind?
That does it –– come here.
Please, let's not stop, George.
Remember the night we broke the windows in this old house? This is what I wished for.
Thanks for dropping around.
Yeah, just started.
You have no idea what's happened to me.
Oh, no you don't. Harry, now, not my best Haviland.
What the hell.  For you....
Soon, dark eyes, soon.
I think we're changing course a little.
Shells and lobsters and stuff?
Too hot in the lighthouse?
Shit.  Shit, shit, shit!
You're betting what you already got.
What the hell, we're steering for it.
Want to swim home?
The rope!  The rope!
I just made it up.  It means, "Get me out of there."  What the hell's that?
Could you just keep that crowd back, please?
About an hour, maybe two.  Let's see -- I came on about eight....
You can't stop me.
Goddamnit, Hendricks, untie the rope there.
Look, humor the old man -- just be careful.
Did you get any pictures?
I know that this was probably a Great White Shark.  Car-cadon... Caradan....
That's it.
Because this big fish has been bitten by some other big fish....
That's it?  Probably?  Look, sharks are attracted by blood, and thrashing around....
And how.  I thought you wouldn't respect me.
Door's locked.
Mrs. Silvera.
For me?
That's great.
Showed them the photo, showed them the goddamn Shark, big as life. They didn't see it.  Not like me. Not like the poor son-of-a-bitch who snapped this li'l picture...He's out there, somewhere... I shot off my gun, shot off my big mouth, so they fired me....
Of course.  Look -- I've got some missing persons, fatalities, evidence of a large predator....
Two of them are still missing!
Someone has to do something.
What?
What for?
Brody?  This is Patrol Base.
That's what I'd like to know.  Lost transmission at Cable Junction.
What's daddy doing?
Dad!  Dad!
Oh, yeah.  So why aren't they doing it now?
Tide doesn't turn for three hours.
Waiting for Andy.
Sure.  They like to play.  We may see some today.
Help!  Help!
3:30.
Huh?
Double nope!
They'll be there when we get there. Might even have a fire started.
Wait a minute.  Promise me something.
That you'll put down a blanket.  I've got black and blue marks all over my butt, and my Mom's getting uptight about them.
Until we find something.
Power line.
Name it.
Coming about....
Eat Cheerios.
Yeah.
Maybe.
I'm not in the way.  Andy, am I in the way?
Forget it, he won't listen.
No, I'm fine, thanks.
Get the hose!  We've got to force more water through the gills and oxygenate him!
No one's ever caught a Great White except indirectly in fishing nets. I want to dart it and keep it alive.
No, it will be too much distraction.  I don't want that many people in the water.  I'll go in, give it a belly shot, and get out.
I know, but you're just going to have to find another way.  So you better start.
No.
See you later.
No, you don't need all that starch.  You're getting too fat.
Up.
God, they're horrible.  I hate them.  Did you see its eyes?  How black they are?  The look in them?
It's easier to lure sharks at night.
Okay.
No,  I'm not going through there.
... He ought to put him in here.
Couple of fractures, lacerations. They say he's gonna be all right.
But you --
I'm  fine.
I just did.  Can you make them do tricks?
Fine.  Have them do some.
Well then, can you have them jump to the camera over here?
Make a lovely item for "Good Morning, America"
Because I don't trust you, that's why.
Somebody could have gotten hurt.
You're a strange man, Mr. Hutton.
Get ready to go.
Brian, he's coming around!
Ten minutes ago.
Don't blame yourself.
Not good enough.
Massachussettans aren't.
Depends on big brother.
Are you really?
Goes back to when I was a kid. Mike's okay, he's gotten over his fears, but I haven't.  I can't even drink it.
Come on!  Check this out!
And alone.
No, think of something else.
It's okay, Sean.
He's diving!
Ohhhhh shhhhiiiit.
Hey.
Yeah, tradition's a bitch, ain't it?
It's large enough...
No way.
Tell Dad we're getting married in Las Vegas.  In one of those chapels.  He can meet us there.
We're in love.
Sometimes my father puts me in his lap and lets me steer the Jeep.
Did you hear what I said?  Come inside....
Yes, I did.
Please, Mom.  At least consider it. You should get away.  You shouldn't be alone now....
Because....
They're at the beach....
But it went away...We would have known....
It went away....
Do you and Michael ever talk about his work...?  About spending so much time working in the water?
I can't help it....
I shouldn't interfere...  My mother-in-law is so neat she puts paper under the cuckoo clock....
Do you enjoy dealing blackjack?
I don't know what he thinks...I don't know what I think...I don't even know why I'm talking about it...  It's silly...I'm getting too old for this sort of thing....
You have something to say about everything....
He knows what he has to do....
I'm hungry, Mom....
You check it....
It's too dangerous....
It's not nice to be evasive.
The water's coming in...The water's coming in....
I didn't.
Mother....
Trying to write our report....
I'm fine....
There's a lot...I want to talk about it....
Promise me....
It could have been an accident....
I'm not saying you're wrong, just that there are other possibilities....
Boss' day off...Take the wheel....
No, you're not....
You're the man who drives the plane.
You got a better idea...?
She said it was coming....
Any faster and it'll turn into a flying Cuisinart and dice us into oblivion....
Nothing!  What the hell are you doing down there?
Inch by inch....
Feathers all over the place....
The females have eggs....
You leave me high and dry...You come back looking like a zombie....
Put me down....
It's not a bad life, Jake....
Gave them the day off....
When I signed on....
So did I....
Lots of times....
So far..
What?
I am...You must know something about him....
You fall off a horse, you get right back on or you don't ride again....
I didn't ask you to....
Screw you, Jake....
Mom....
The big picture...If we can't get him to swallow it, we'll shove it up his....
Oh no--
Is it your vehicle?
Old guy, offed himself with a knife. I can't find the knife.
You heard. Look for the knife.
Since when did you drink diet soda?
Seven thirty-five .. Here, "Town Gets Top Cop." I was gonna pin it to your wall.
So am I. But where's my money?
Then give me that Zippo.
I don't want excuses, I want that weird-looking stuff called "cash."
Listen to me saying what?
For a <u>dead</u> <u>dog</u>?
I wish he'd tell that to Citrine.
Car accident.
No .. You didn't know that ..
I spose I'm drinking myself to sleep. It's Helena's Christmas songs .. they're really pretty ..
This "cop" that's calling, thinks she gonna be there over Christmas.
Yeah, that's all very inter- esting, but where's the body?
Three or four.
And did they?
Wrong cabinet.
Bullshit.
Well, her, it ain't. That bitch is blind as a blonde fucken bat.
I was hopin since we spoke that you might have remembered something that would give us an idea where she is?
I don't know. I guess she must have called him John? I'm mak- ing tea. Would you like some?
No. Except he smoked. Like you.
Yes.
I don't know.
No, just a minute or two .. I knocked on your door - no one home, so I followed the music ..
Of course I would ..
I know, but you pick on the one time in my life I like not to remember. I was in the bad lands. Really not well. It's something that happens to a lota cops. We don't wanna talk about that.
You said, you were in the bad lands?
Alright, I'm worried about Christmas. I wish I hadn't told him I'd be back ..
It's not possible right now.
Please don't ask no quest- ions now .. Not right now ..
I know you're trying to help me, but you don't understand.
Yes, Sir.
The man from the F.B.I.
C'mon, Chief, if it's sensitive, tell me .. I'm not taking notes ..
Grateful for your candor, Sir.
You find something curious in that?
Then let me put your mind at ease .. Firstly, Amber isn't "blind" - she has some useful vision - and second, this isn't a prison, it's a college of higher education - a severe vis- ual disability doesn't mean my stud- ents don't value their independence as much as anybody else - and Amber was a very independent young woman - She decided to leave - so she left ..
Suzanne? Very pretty. She was a semi- professional model. But a policeman's wife she wasn't. So one day, she just packed it and left. And his whole life went straight down the nearest toilet.
You know, he crashed. He just couldn't come to terms with it .. John hates to lose, and he hated losing her .. Every spare minute, he's driving down to San Diego, having a terrible time with her, getting drunk, and driving back .. you just don't believe the amount he drank ..
Dinner's another night, darlin .. This is a drive-by. I got an hour ..
She's a doll. But I wish he hadn't brought her out here.
Well, that's who she is. Cept she can't run away.
Don't annoy me, Travis.
That's right.
Don't worry about it -- I never told you what I thought of that memo either --
Could you just stop moving?
Everything's on the fucking run! Everything --
Go ahead.  Jump right on into my nightmare.  The water's warm. _ 65.
I'm not trying to make history. _ 67.
Oh come on --
They ain't laughing, man. Something's wrong.
Hmm.  Pretty good.
I just got goosebumps.
Good evening.
Maybe love shouldn't be such hard work. I know, but --
Good night.
Right.  I'll come in.
Easy, easy --
Tell me -- let me help --
Well -- I'm not the guy who's going to run.  I stick.
You want...
Aw, shut up.  You had me at hello. _ 130.
Of course, medical! _ 42.
At eleven at night? _ 70.
No--
Please, if I start talking --
Oh, well, why didn't you say so? And oh, I don't know if you're interested in this detail, but I was just about to tell you that I love him.  I love him, and I don't care what you think.  I love him for the guy he wants to be, and I love him for the guy he almost is. I love him.
We decided to stay with you.
Now doesn't that just make you feel good to say it?  Say it with me.
Why the fuck am I here?  I feel like I'm five years late for the Prom.
Very much.
Huh?
No, I'm saying to be --
Won't happen.  I'm strong in my mind.
Oh, we gonna be friends now?
No.  A real man does not shoplift the "pooty" from a single mom.
No.
Hey, that's my word, okay?
Then why'd you get married?  I'm asking you as a friend.
Look.  I'm happy to entertain you, as always, but I have a question for you.  Are we really "friends?"
Well, friends can tell each other anything, right? If we have our "friends" hats on --
Well.  Good luck with that --
Tell me, and then you can sleep.
To the pools.  Now she's Miss Rock Climber, and I'm more the Non-Rock Climber, but we're hiking up through the pools and there's a fine mist in the air, and I have the ring in my pocket, and I'm a little nervous, I'm lagging behind, and she says to me, get this -- "Hurry up, klutz."
And say what?  "Please remove your dick from my ass?!"
Don't be silly.
The best commercial director in the business.  I hail you.
I know.  It sucks.  I suck.
Thanks.  May I offer you both a ride?
Hi Ray.
Wait.  I want to tell you more about my dad.
We'll go to the zoo sometime. Okay? I think I might have some time on my hands.
Shut up!!!
One way to find out.
It is truly, what’s the word? Inspiring.
What?
What's a bad idea?
Twenty, twenty-fire pounds. I've been swimming at the Y.
People change.
Well we should split up or something. We can cover twice the area.
Nothing.
Just drop it Paul!
Eric!
I want to find them too, but we can't do a bit of good right now. For every scary thing we saw in the daylight, I'll bet there ten times more of 'em at night.  Am I right?
Well damn it. I don't speak ill of the dead. What I'm trying to say is, it’s was just a crazy accident. The exact same thing could have happened if he was with me. You can't go beating yourself up about it.
I'm trying! That thing took him down this way!
I would completely support that.
Who's that?
What about Eric and Dr. Grant?
He loves you too.
It's a rapid prototyper. I feed in the scan data from the raptor skull, than the computer breaks it into thousands of slices which this thing prints, one layer on top of the other. It's the future of paleontology.
You think they could talk to each other?
Goodbye, Alan.
The important thing is we both made it. That's something we have in common.
A raptor claw. I use to have one. A fossil.
Are you sure?
Closer you get to the water, the bigger things get.
Then we go home?
No. Although I've studied them in the wild.
Well sir, I am a great admirer of yours, and I have an extremely interesting proposition to discuss. Would you let my wife and I take you to have dinner tonight? Our treat.
Now, for our wedding anniversary this year we wanted to do something really special, something...
I have never been on this island!
But you never came across just one.
Just a little bit too much, I think.
You broke that idiot's jaw for no reason other than your boredom.  Tell the truth, Roland.  Aren't you even interested in knowing this expedition's quarry?
If the nest is upwind, so are we. When he comes back, he'll know we're here before we have a chance.  The truck --
Like if you shoot yourself in the foot?  Wouldn't matter.  You'd be dead  before you realized you'd accidentally pulled the trigger.
Because I didn't know!  I don't have the faintest idea what they're doing here.
Well?  Didn't it all seem a trifle compact to you?
-- my --
Everyone, keep your voices down!
I want to see the nesting ground!
Dr. Malcolm -- the world -- owes you an apology.
Stop saying fantastic.  Where are you going?
No, Dad.  I have thoughts of my own once in a while.
Which one?
That was about a year ago.
No.  Richard talked to his parents.
I'm fine, I'm fine, I was scared, I thought you, are you okay?!
Rex won't be any different.  It'll come.
There are no versions of the truth! This isn't a corporate maneuver, it's my life.
Don't ask me.  The guy's completely out to lunch.
You're going too?
Oh, my God.
But why?
It's called self-testing.  But in your case, it sounds more like self-destruction.  A uniquely human characteristic.  In fact, human beings destroy things so well that I sometimes think that's our function. Maybe every few sons, some animal comes along that kills off the rest of the world, clears the decks, and lets evolution proceed to his next phase.  Maybe death and destruction are our job, maybe we're supposed to destroy ourselves and every other living thing that-
Current evidence seems to be to the contrary, wouldn't you say?!  GIVE IT TO THEM!
I was a cameraman for Nightline for six years, been freelance since '91. Do a lot of work for Greenpeace.
You think this is all a joke?
Oh, no!
That little black line means death for this infant.  The fibula won't heal straight, so the ankle joint can't pivot when he stands on his hind feet.  The baby won't be able to run, and probably can't even walk. It'll be crippled, and a predator will pick it off before it gets more than a few weeks old.
Move where?  Our boat's not coming for two days, your airlift is waiting for an order you have no way to send --
Runs against my nature to hole up in a cave and wait.
Damn!
So how much for our first tour.  Two no-shows and one sick triceratops.
Where did the vehicles stop?
Yeah, again, in  theory, but - -
Oh, you know, if it's alright, I'd like to stay with Dr. Harding and finish with the trike.  Is that okay?
These are dilated.  Take a look.
I'll catch up with you.  You can go with the others.
Come along.  I know my way around a kitchen.  Come along.
Control?!  You never had control!  I was overwhelmed by the power of this place.  So I made a mistake too.  I didn't have enough respect for that power, and it's out now.  You're sitting here trying to pick up the pieces. John, there's nothing worth picking up.  The only thing that matters now are the people we love.  Alan, Lex, and Tim.  And John, they're out there where people are dying - - people are dying, you know?
They died together?
That's good.  That's right!  They died around a dried-up puddle!  Without fighting each other.  This is looking good.
Yeah, plenty.  Some of them can't walk!
What kind of park is it?
Say again?
- - which is called a gizzard, and it helps them mash their food, but what happens after a while - -
I can't get it!  I can't get it unless I move!
I don't know.
Yeah.
Juanito, if they pull the funding, that will really slow things down.  If they pull the funding that's going to slow things down around here.
Because he's like me.  He's a digger.
Forty-eight hours from now, I'll be accepting your apologies.  Now get out of the way.  So I can see them!
No, we don't have any animatronics here.  These are the real miracle workers of Jurassic Park.
Donald, this park was not built to carter only to the super rich.  Everyone in the world's got a right to enjoy these animals.
Listen, ahh - -
Really?
Triceratops was a constant browser, and constant browsers would be constantly sick.
Tim, I'll come back for you.  I'll get Lex out first.
But - - my grandpa said all the dinosaurs were girls.
Nope.
Not without massive sequence gaps!
Kids get scared.
I didn't say I was scared.
Wu?
I guess we'll just have to evolve too.
It's okay!  It's okay!  It's a brachiosaur!
You're a beautiful big animal.
John, John.
Don't you see the danger, John, inherent in what you're doing here?  Genetic power is the most awesome force ever seen on this planet.  But you wield it like a kid who's found his dad's gun.
Hold on - - this is no species that was obliterated by deforestation or the building of a dam.  Dinosaurs had their shot.  Nature selected them for extinction.
I will not get drawn into another financial conversation with you, Dennis.  I really will not.
Thanks for the presents.
What if we fall?  I hate trees.
Fifty? We need seventy-five.
Don't tell me you're still thinking of buying Casa de Psycho...
Do you think they like the fact that tourism has dropped ninety-eight percent in the last ten years?
Logging? We'll need an environmental impact study for that...
Great.
Yeah?
Where's Ken? Is he all right?
Some kind of emergency back at the Sheriff's Station. Four deputies shot... some kind of explosion... I don't know what's going on, but they're panicking back there.
No. When you put me on the stand, I'll say your client is catatonic and exhibits classic symptoms of a schizophrenic, sociopathic personality.  And he doesn't sleep.
I always throw that in. It makes the jury feel sorry for the defendant.
So?
You're obviously going through a critical moral dilemma. And you're putting up barriers against anyone who tries to probe your conscience.  But it is heartening to know that you do have a conscience.
There's a pizza place over on Market.
Me too. I'm drunk.
Now.... according to the file, Krueger was burned to death in a fire in 1968. But get this -- beginning in 1984, there was _another_ series of murders in Springwood. All teenagers... all killed in their sleep... all killed with finger blades just like Krueger's.
I'll have to lean on them pretty hard after what happened last night... but I think I can do it.  Let me know what happens.
I used to go hunting with my father when I was a kid.
_Neurolar_. It's a stimulant -- it's also a serotonin inhibitor. It suppresses all electrical activity in the hippocampus... the part of the brain that controls dreaming.
About ten minutes.
If I give you a bigger dose, it'll give you a heart attack.
Let's split up. You take the left side, I'll take the right. We'll meet in front of the Cineplex.
Did you?
Naturally? -- that's not the word I would have chosen.
An empty tomb?
Not a chance.  I'm the thinnest person I know.
What an extraordinary request!
Burgel, I thought it would be easier, as long as I was passing --
I'll commit that to memory.
Not today, Burgel.  Send one of your memos, write up one of your communiques, but for God's sake don't bother me today.
You're detestable.
Attitude, Kafka.  It doesn't matter how well you do your work -- you still see it as something to be gotten on with rather than something to take an active interest in.
In a small way.
Excuse me, I have to copy this for Central Docketing by 2:30.
Eduard didn't see it as something that needed bearing.
You won't have any trouble finding it.
They're ubiquitous.  What we try to do ... is make them a little less so.
I've hardly published enough for anyone to draw conclusions from.
My only concern is the human tribunal.  Isn't it yours?
Burgel gave me this -- what does it mean?
Why were you given notice?
You don't believe that.
Burgel hated Eduard.  And me.  I'm sure he knew about us -- and I'm sure it drove him mad.
I knew you walked this way to work.  I wanted to find you before they did.
Yes.  Yes, of course -- why wouldn't it be?
Eight -- and seven months.
Well -- other departments are, yes.
Yes.  Since he came to the office, almost three years ago, we've been quite good friends.  How was Eduard ...
Close only by virtue of antithesis.
"Accident and Compensation" -- no one can accuse the firm of not supplying exactly what it promises.
Whenever an employee departs, shall we say, it's up to the head of his department to requisition his file, reassign any outstanding claims, and send it off.
Orlac is an account?
Dr. Murnau was the bravest of men. He spent an entire career in those backwaters with no regard for personal gain.  A great loss.
Is your friend's name among them?  Then he only worked on the one case.  Your Chief will send me the final summation when he's finished with it.
You do not summon them -- they summon you -- and this, of course, hardly ever happens, if at all. The Directors are an eccentric lot and by nature cautious.
We're a medical firm, aren't we? They go to the Medical Records Section.
Oskar.
Amerika for us!
Does this look like the "Queen Mary"?? We don't take passengers! Full steam ahead, Captain Engelhorn!
To be quite honest, Mr Denham ... I find the whole idea to be quite reprehensible.
Take your filthy paws off him -you ignorant pig!
These are priceless artifacts! They're ruining the site!
I don't know what happened to you, Jack ... but I can't believe you were always this much of a bastard.
I'm not sailing with this thing on board!
Take to look out there ..- Have you seen what he's done? You're talking about a crazy animal!
It' s alright Jack ... it' s alright.
We need those co-ordinates -someone's gotta get back there and jot the rest of it down
I'm chartering this vessel,Engelhorn - how many days?
Yeah, I saw her ... she was carried into the jungle by ... an animal.
That's your monkey, Denham.
She's got a bit of an attitude, that girl. She's turned down a bunch of money. Too bad ... it would've been a great angle - "Beauty and the Beast".  I must be getting old - I thought you two had something going there.
She was with you after she left Frank.
Well -- well I'm just back. And -- I must tell you -- something quite wonderful.
Yes?
I'd just be guessing.
Now there's a picture I'd like you to --
We don't want to just lock him up; we want a conviction, we wanted him to do something more.
Yes.
I'm an investigator. I'd like to ask you some questions about Tom Grunemann.
I don't want you to look up. There's someone on the skylight.
Is that what you gave him?
It was Jane McKenna who sent you the dumper.
Yeah, you got to me.
Mm.
Arlyn had a very big habit - heroin - she's the one who started Frank. She's strung out now; you won't find her.
Why?
I don't get you.
You get the Christ out! You dumb stupid bastard, you don't know anything, you square, you get out! I don't have to show you anything; you get out!
I don't like getting splashed.
What?
Don't touch anything.
Drop it.
Oh.  Well it wasn't us city people that did it -- your fine rosy-cheeked country boy.
No. I was going to come up. I wanted to ask you to marry me. 
About what?
OK.
It's got to make sense some way.
Yeah. It wasn't Tom.
Not too bad. This brings back that Dumper in the picture.
Pete, I've got a chance to buy Jane McKenna's black book.
Call-girls generally keep a book, you know, a list of their clients. Sometimes, if a girl retires, she'll even sell it worth good money. Jane McKenna had a black book; when she died it was stolen. I've been after it a long time.
All right, but I'm going to see that list.
Tomorrow. See you tomorrow night.
I'll be sending you on a report tonight.
It's not so bad.
What's in it?
All right.
Because he knew I couldn't leave the case alone. And this way at least he'd keep track of it. And me.
He called this morning from Tuscarora. Asked me to meet him at 3:00 at the downtown heliport. He's on his way to Chicago.
Yeah.
Unless he was involved with Grunemann's disappearance.
I left them here. I was doing some work here.
Inspector we understand your position; ours is a little different. We have an investment in Tom Grunemann. The Company has an investment, and we feel entitled to investigate for ourselves.
Yes sir, we know he --
Yes?
Doctor, I attempt to conduct my social life discreetly.  At the moment I am seeing no one.
Not particularly.
Detroit.
What about your mommy?
Do you like to be with your mommy?
The little hand is on the six and the big hand is on the nine. Where is mommy?
I'll call Thelma and remind her, okay?  Don't worry.
That's okay...
I hate it.
Some of the brown stuff is still there.
Tough shit.  You're stuck with me.
Sure.  Lots of times.
Sure.
The first couple, yes, but after that it became increasingly difficult.
Your honor, I'd like to ask what this model of stability and respectability has ever succeeded at?  Mrs. Kramer, were you a failure at the longest, most important personal relationship in your life?
Can you recall any particular incident that relates to Mr. Kramer's care of his child?
Objection!
Thank you.  I have no further questions.
Yes.
No.
No.
Do you have a lover now?
I...I don't know...
Yes.
Ted, I'm leaving you.
Okay, okay...What is it this time? What did I do now?...
So we've got problems.  Everybody's got problems--that's normal--
Okay, I understand and I promise I won't try and stop you, but you can't just go...Look, come inside and talk...Just for a few minutes.
You've been living here, in the city?
Are you out of your mind?! You're the one that walked out on him, remember?
Ted, do you love him?
Beautiful.
I don't know, Jim.  This whole thing has happened so...Pow-- like that.
Jim, I appreciate what you're saying.  I mean it, but I really think Joanna's coming back.
Murray.
Right.
Kramer--
Kramer...There's something I ought to tell you.
I've been offered a job in Washington with H.E.W.
Do you want the kid or don't you?
Charley, my husband, and I are ...divorced and Kim, that's our daughter is about Billy's age and the children play together a lot.  So, I guess we see each three or four times a week.
Look, Ted, all I--
I mean...things.  Ted, Joanna's very unhappy and--
Maybe she didn't feel like she should have to.  Maybe she felt like if you'd been paying any real attention to her to start with, maybe you would've noticed.
I don't know, Thel...This whole thing has happened so...Pow, like that.
I'm sure.
Lenox Hill.  77th Street between Park and Lex.  The emergency number is 327-0800.
Three.  And add some basil.
No.  I don't think so.
Not for a couple of months. The last time I heard from her she was living in San Francisco.
I told her you're doing a
Uh, huh...
All right, Thelma...That's it. I've had it.  You can call your good friend Joanna Kramer and tell her enough is enough, okay?  I mean, I don't know what I did, but you can tell her she's made her point.
No cried?
And we will begin with tearing it down.
The Tibetans were introduced as delegates from the "Chinese region of Tibet". We protested this reference and demanded a letter rebutting it.
All?
Yes. Most of the Chamdo region is now in Chinese hands. There is a report from Chamdo which makes quite clear that, unless some settlement can soon be reached, Communist troops will soon be marching on Lhasa.
Not yet, but the Governor of Chamdo, Ngabo Jigme, suggests we must negotiate and offers to go to Peking.
Yes.
Please.
It is an island. American territory.
So, Tibet, too, needs to define itself.
Ask the Chinese mission to leave our country. Immediately.
I shall send a letter to America, to the President, informing him of our problem.
At this point, the most likely result of a foreign pact is war.
I had relinquished doubt.
You decide.
Is that a true story, or pretend?
But, surely, we are safe in Tibet. We don't believe in killing.
Then, I am lucky. I am still too young.
The people will cry when they learn you are gone. But they would all want you safe.
We cannot.
What would you do, Holiness?
The land has stayed in the family. We work together. The nobleman is not too bad.
Look for a strong woman, not too occupied with her beauty. Look for a woman who keeps her hands busy. Look for a kind heart.
No.  Do you?
My department doesn't have any record of that, Mrs. Bickerman.
'Cause this is the cove he obviously lives in.
If he's eaten in the area, he shouldn't be far away.  Crocs hang around the food source.
Well, you've got a croc alright, they're keystone species.
No!!  Out!
Deep down, gut check.  I'm growing fond of <u>you</u> and it's liberating to say so.
What the hell are you doing?!!
No thank you, but maybe later you can chew the bark off my big fat log.
You don't want to cut me down. 'Cause I'll kill you.
I have no interest in ever looking at you, Hector.  Could you please cut me down?
He didn't eat the kid cause he'd just swallowed a bear.
Right.
You ready on shore?
You do?
U.S. Wildlife won't send anybody without a confirmation.
Can I tell them you won't go back in the water?
Ma'am, your first impression isn't going well.
Big but... a bear couldn't do that to a moose or man in <u>water</u>.  On <u>land</u> maybe.  But...
Hank <u>says</u> he's sure.
Well.  You don't have to <u>stay</u> out <u>here</u>, why don't--
Who?
<u>Something's</u> in that water.
I am <u>not</u> staying on shore.
Good.
I thought I might track the shoreline tomorrow, look for prints.
Just gotta pull it a little tighter.
Well...
You wanna ride in my truck?
Likewise.
White perch.
Obviously I was wrong!
<u>You</u> <u>gotta</u> <u>be</u> <u>kidding</u>.
Where is he?!
Yes, <u>camp</u>, I thought that meant Holiday Inn, I never heard "tents", will there be toilets?
I think.  My hair.  Where's Hector?!  Where is he?
Such a simple idea and it's working.  What does that tell you?
Absolutely.
It's ten after nine.
Kevin.  How's it going, what's happenin', family good, great, nice to catch up, get out.
I'm sure it's nothing, but you're a paleontologist, this is what we do, I--
<u>Kelly</u>--
It was just a quick thing which we thought was over, and and...
Liar?
Thanks, Ardelia.
Not random at all, maybe. Like there's some pattern here...?
Agent Mapp! Thank you!
Dr. Chilton, I told you - this is just routine follow-up on the Raspail case.
I need the ID to fly with my gun. The gun belongs in Quantico.
Lecter has already named Buffalo Bill.
Sir, doesn't this "William Rubin" strike you as - I don't know - kind of vague?
Starling -
The market in Lecter hints is way down, today, okay? I've got two good men dead in Memphis, and three civilians. I've got -
Okay, Mr. Yow...
Just briefly. What's the problem, Officer?
Jack Gordon.
Thanks.
Yes. I bought the house from her, two years ago.
Right down to the kleenex I used.  Sir, why? Is something wrong?
To complete and file my report by 0800 Wednesday. But sir -
He's a white male... Serial killers tend to hunt within their own ethnic group. And he's not a drifter - he's got his own house, somewhere. Not an apartment.
He's got a real taste for it now. And he's getting better at his work.
You haven't said a word today about that garage. Or what I found there.
They'll use their best men. But they better be paying attention...
Starling - you've earned back your place in the Academy. We never would've found him without you, and nobody's ever going to forget that. Least of all me.
They live in Malaysia. In this country, they'd have to be specially raised, from imported eggs.
"We" being the Behavioral Science Unit, at Quantico. You're one of Jack Crawford's, I expect.
We're talking about psychology, Doctor, not the Bureau. Can you decide for yourself whether or not I'm qualified?
Yes.
Maybe they'll catch up.
A census taker once tried to test me. I ate his liver with some fava beans and a nice chianti... Fly back to school, little Starling.
Then please - do this test for me.
If you didn't kill him, then who did?
I don't know. Next time I'll have to check.
Was it a butterfly?
The significance of the moth is change. Caterpillar into cocoon into beauty... Billy wants to change, too, Clarice. But there's the problem of his size, you see. Even if he were a woman, he'd have to be a big one...
Billy's not a real transsexual, but he thinks he is. He tries to be. He's tried to be a lot of things, I expect.
Dr. Lecter, when there's time I'll -
And - one morning I just - ran away...
Got dressed without turning on the light. I went downstairs... outside...
But what became of your lamb?  Clarice...?
Yes! I don't know...! I don't know.
Well, Clarice, have the lambs stopped screaming...?
You know I can't make that promise.
You want to see a violation? This is a violation...
It may be that - I could confer with my colleagues on this. And get back to you.
Toughened your nipples, didn't it...?  Six foot one, strongly built, about 190 pounds. Hair brown, eyes pale blue. He'd be about 35 now. He said he lived in Philadelphia, but may have lied. That's really all I can remember, Senator - but if I think of any more, I'll let you know.
Officer Starling. Welcome back.
I'm the one who found his perforating proboscis! Are you wearing a gun, right now?  Ooh, cool! Can I see it? Can I?
I won't sleep tonight. What an adventure!  I absolutely cannot wait to return to Portman Square, having laid eyes upon the full-blooded, red men in the wild!
Yes. He said... "do not try to make them understand you."
Yes. And "do not try to understand them.  That is because they are a breed apart and they make no sense..."
I don't know. Whatever happens you stay with your father. You stay among the officers.
...never doubt what you are doing.
I have nothing to go back for.
Winter with the Delaware, my father's cousins. And in the spring, cross the Ohio and look for land to settle with my father in a new place called Can-tuck-ee.
When? How?
There was no letter.
Yes I do! I know exactly what I am saying.  And if it is sedition, then I am guilty of sedition, too!
And by sea!
We were headed...
Day and a half  Where did you get... the guide?
Dark haired...
No.
That is sedition! Treason!
Only chance we got is...  ... to get more distance on 'em and go to ground!
We don't.
You will have to forego the pleasure of hangin' me.
You, sir! You call yourself a loyal subject?
That reason wear a blue dress and work in the surgery?
I know.  One has to give Americans "reasons" and make agreements to get them to do anything at all.  Tiring, isn't it?  But that's the way of it here.
General Webb can burn in hell. We'll go back and dig our graves behind the ramparts! Our mission is to fight.
Fire!!!
I understand. This is not good place to stop.  Two leagues from here. No water 'til then.  That where we stop. Better place.
"Magua understand paleface is a dog to his women.  When his women want to eat, he lay aside his tomahawk to feed their laziness."
Gifts?
For Munro children?
Heart. Give Magua new heart.
That Le Renard has the power to lead his people into the light, I know well.
And this?
And I to make yours, Monsieur le Marquis.
However I may apprise such testimony from Monsieur Montcalm, Fort William Henry is strong and stands.
Carry them to England to your King with pride.
La victoire.
Well, I'll be on the golf course in the morning.  Then, if I don't have any babies to deliver--
These observers were doing something. A test...I think they sank that ship on purpose to cover up their mistakes.
I'm not a doctor.
And they didn't believe the symptoms I described...
No.  I think they isolated him in genetic engineering. Homo aquaticus...
Danakil man?...one of our ancestors.  Named for the Danakil Alps in Ethiopia.
But what about those scales... or that leech-like thing that bit Cobb?
Well, if they were perfecting an aquaman, then why's there a dead one onboard that Russian ship?  Why isn't he out swimming around?
He don't need a readout, man, he needs help!
What has?
No.
Fuck your orders!
How do you know it was Williams?
What?
There probably wasn't anything wrong with his suit...
Roger...  More light, Sixpack...
Why can't we pick up his signal?
I need electrical field experience on my resume. Everything helps...  Why are you here?
How much time does that give us?
You're only twenty-five tons off quota.  Barring an unforeseen problem you should reach it easily on the last day.  It's just a day off.  You don't have to take it, I just thought it might help.
Mr. Beck, the contract states that no body can be disposed of without authorization of---
Let's get it out of here and bring in a new one.
Not yet.
You're damn right I do.  Five years down here and I'll pull in more than 15 topside.  I'm not down here for the fun, I'll tell you that.
The weather's good, I already checked, but I'll be off in a minute.
...and a Russian grandmother...
It...almost got you.
Whooo!  Right on, Cobb!  Let's hear it for our shop Steward!
He didn't say it was a "routine check-up," he said it was a "routine <u>precaution</u>."
It's Hazy...It's got him! Stay here and don't let him out.  I'm going to get the Doc.
I ain't doing nothing for that thing without something to defend myself.
And hit the surface in the middle of a typhoon?...No, thank you. I'll take my chance down here.
We're simply concerned about her...proximity to...
Like a leech.
"Debbie Does Dallas"...  Hell, it's in Russian.  I can't read it...
Sleeping.  No sign of Doc, though.  I'll check the control room.  You look in the shower room...
Fucking great...You telling me we got a fucking dracula in here with us?
The air's stopped.
She's wondering what's happening.  We're losing air faster than I thought.
Your pocket?
A traffic warden. Look, what's this?
Jesus, Tom, do they work?
Like antiques.
We made a deal for everything inside the cabinet.
Don't play innocent with me Bazza; spanking!
You're doing it for me is all you need to know. You only know that because you need to know.
Can I help?
Jesus Christ!
No chance of you lifting this sunbed up is there?
I won't be seeing you again Chris; I have paid him every last penny.
Made a few quid, did ya? Now where is it?
Well, you had better go and get it from the office. That's if you want to see your son reach his next birthday. Now chop-fuckin'-chop.
Well, it's a five minute walk or a thirty second drive.
About twenty minutes.
Try that one.
Sure is.
Furry muff, let's go.
What is the point in that? Even if it was a bug they would have taken it with 'em.
OK, open the gate.
There is only three of us here.
Out the back.
Well that depends on how you look at it. I can afford it as long as I see it again, if that's what you mean. You got the rest from the fat man and Bacon?
Jesus, Soap, stop being such a mincer. I thought about that and...
Where did they get those outfits from? Haven't we got some like that, Tom?
Listen, if he has the guns he might have the money . . . I think we should go and see him.
Tom, go and throw those guns off a bridge.
What do you mean?
The man who decides if you can play is this man Harry, or Hatchet Harry as some including himself like to call him.
Right as rain.
A hundred grand.
You will what?
For half a million?
It's Ed, if that's what you mean.
I wanted to talk to you about that.
Look, could you just open the door so I could talk without shouting?
Of course you are. All right, Ed.
You know how much it is, Nick.
At what, exactly?
You're not funny Tom; you're fat and look as though you should be funny, but you're not.
Tom, the fatter you get, the sadder you get.
That's fucked it. What do we do now? No money, no weed; it's all been swapped for a pile of corpses.
So?
Oh, come on--you and Grandma think anybody who works with their hands is a peasant. When Dad--
No, sir--
Follow orders. Do whatever they say.
The--the officers.
Thank you, sir.
We were just dancing--
Sergeant?
Yeah, this is Skinny.
He swore by it.  What?
So is Buddy on your short list?
You got to investigate. No question about it.
You do whatever I say you do or else you put it on the trail, son.
Who said anything about shootin' anybody?
That's in Maverick County.
Daddy calls it an "altercation." How you doing, Sam? You look skinny.
No, it wasn't, was it? You didn't exactly throw yourself into it heart and soul, did you?
Colonel. Is uhm--is Otis in?
I been here with him eight years now. He built it when he was with Leora.
He never asked her.
No sir.
No sports if I don't keep a B average, no TV on school nights, no PDA's--
By blood you are. But blood only means what you let it.
You got to be in the Army, you might as well have something slick to drive.
He does.
You ever know a fella named Eladio Cruz?
Lead mine.
Man knows a hundred-fifty varieties of beer, he can't tell a poinsettia from a prickly pear.
We had a kid pass out in the men's room. The town isn't much.
I knew she was Japanese going into it, but she didn't tell me the ninja assassin part--
You could take it--
I'd quit the Army for you, if it came to that.
That ring--
Pleased to meet you.
I meant on the post. In general. How are you dealing with it?
So tell me why I shouldn't make this place off-limits.
We have an enlisted man's club at the post.
I hear things, too.  People call you the Mayor of Darktown.
And people make their choice--
You know this road got a bad reputation, Eladio--
Bandidos, Injuns--
Si--tengo escopeto--just a shotgun--
Good night, Enrique. She slides into the car--
We was crossin' the river--
You think you're doing these people a favor? What are they going to do? Either they get on welfare or they become criminals--
He was a unique individual.
We're already renting cells to the Feds for their overflow--
We need a drug rehab program, we need a new elementary school--
Sounds great. Where do I sign up?
Just as well. The new people just painted it some God-awful color--
There's no call for that, Sam. Fella made himself a pile of enemies over the years.
We have a murder?
Do you?
I got to go see somebody in San Antonio today. Your memory gets any better, I'll be back tonight.
Word gets out who that body was, people are gonna think Buddy done it.
Danny's gonna be out for blood the next time.
Spanish, please. My mother would have a heart attack.
Sure, they go back to Cortez. When he rode by, they were squatting in a hut cooking hamsters for dinner.
I'm unmarried. I'm not available.
He was killed.
I was too busy.
Sheriff Deeds' dead, honey--you just Sheriff junior.
Sheriff Buddy was a different story. Long as Roderick throw his weight the right way on election day, make sure all the colored get out to vote- we was called colored back then, if you was polite--maybe throw a barbecue for the right people now and then, things was peaceful. That Sheriff Wade, though, he took an awful big bite.
Hollis probably told you we found Charley Wade.
Yeah?
How much you got left?
You stop growing that loco weed at your place, you'd see a lot more daylight.
I'm surprised he bothered with it.
They've got my Amado.
Somebody called--something about an electronics store.
We haven't talked since high school.
A real palace. She rattles around alone in that thing--
So she tells me three times a week.
They cooked the whole thing up without asking me.
Amado.
You've got your mother, your kids--
You know the other day, you asked why I came back?
I don't know. It just feels good. Always did.
Don't have kids. Other pictures--I don't know--it's nothing I want to look back on.
Pilar--
She'll figure it out sooner or later. I don't have to ask permission anymore, if that's what you mean.
Couple months before I was born--
The shooter local?
Nothin' much. The Rangers put Ben Wetzel on it. Catch you later.
I'm going over to the other side.
This isn't Houston, my friend. We pretty much running things now. Our good day has come.
What's up?
Yeah. It's quiet--
So when did Buddy leave?
No--
Yeah.  It's French.
Yeah.  She was killed in a car crash.  Her lawyer was driving. She was filing for divorce.
That would have kept you out of the Magic Circle.  Which was presumably the idea.  These are about Nix.
I mean, there's no instructions--  What do you mean, they're not tricks?
Hey, anytime.  Actually, no.  This was enough.
That's so cool.
Deep shit?
What is he?
I heard what happened.  It looks like somebody murdered him.
Yes.  I think you probably can.  We'd need to talk about your fee.
Why?  Because he had you?
Why don't you tell me the truth?
I told you --
And they all came...
Find Valentin!  Find him!  Get him in here!
It's all right.  It's not hurting...
Yes.
Good.  There.  Yes?
Nix was never interested in you. It was always Swann.
The usual.  Full house. Standing ovation.  I tell them it's magic...
I just saw him.
Sure.  You want me to find out about Quaid?  I mean, the funeral?
Tapert's got nothing to do with this.  He came here to get his palm read.
He got up and walked.
So could you walk on water?
Oh, I've got plenty.
Evil.  He was evil.  Come on.
We've never met.
I'm here to offer you a job.
Mine.
You could almost pass for a detective, D'Amour.  I work for the best illusionist in the world.
Probably.
Are you a believer, then?
Swann's wife.
Haven't you seen enough to know that doesn't matter?
We've got to get you to a hospital.
What's her problem?
Too late.  Why are you here? Did you cone... up here for a reading?
Yeah.  You could say that.
What?
You don't know the half of it. I'm Walter Wilder, by the way.
I'd love to... you know... hang with some of you guys.
For what?
They'll never find out.
I did it for Dorothea.
It's me betrayed him.
Will that do?  No?
Didn't know you read minds.
Is that all?
And you believed him?
A couple of weeks.
No.
What about Philip Swann?
I don't want to think about it. If I think about it he'll hear me. He'll find me.
And he's dead?
No!
You want to be like that, Swann? Mud and shit?
Not true.
Yes.
Yes.
Ok, you're scheduled to leave Saturday, but we'll hold a seat Thursday in case, but first class is full, you're waitlisted for an upgrade... there might be a seat on Lufthansa...
So, we got you on an earlier flight, but I really think you should think about staying for that talk show.
You're probably just having a mid- life crisis. Did you buy a Porche?
Thanks. I'm sure your mid-life crisis will work out,too.
I'm here for the week.
Hi, Charlie.
Ok.
Do you want to have some breakfast?
OK, see you downstairs.
I see them every morning.
I think he kind of liked me...Is that so hard to imagine?
I know, I kind of blend in here.
I don't know. My fax said "have a good fright".
Thanks. It does, the more you know who you are... you don't care about things the same way...
When they're born its like Vietnam. It's terrifying.
I know, but that's what you like about me.
They really have to work on that street name thing.
I don't know, I think maybe I broke it? I knocked into something the other day...
I don't want to be.
Hi, Bob.
Yes, no.
Hello, darling.
That sounds great — can you hold on...  What Zoe?
Good-night.
Bob?
What are you talking about?
Why don't you just stay there, and you can have it everyday.
Do you want to talk to  Zoe?
Thank you, Mr. Harris.
Hello, can I have room 5601.
I went to a temple today and I didn't feel anything.
I got some hair stuff.
Ok, have fun there, you're so lucky you don't have any kids yet and you can go off to Japan... call me when you get back.
I'm just here shooting this band, what about you?
Sushi.
No.  Of course not.  Mmmm.  Anago.  My favorite.
What happened?
When did they find her?
Like you need to admit that losing your parents when you were twelve was traumatic.
Well, it shattered your faith in everything.
You need to believe in something besides yourself.
I don't know.  What are they?
Peter, are you okay?
What time did you make it for?
Not the guards.  Some of the prisoners are easily disturbed.
Of course not.  They put him through severe mental stress.  Causing this aneurysm.
You know I'm not comfortable with this.
I'm aware of that, but I don't think he's in any condition to make requests. I'm trying to appeal to your more...logical self, Father.  I'm concerned about harm to my patient.
I think I should join you.
You heard voices, you know you did.
You ready?
Something he said, just before...
You're right, but it's funny.  All my life I thought I was simply a man who didn't believe in any of it.
I had to.  There was no other way. Their deaths were part of the greatest legacy I could have given you.
Yes.  We won, that's right.
It's true.  Birdson knew your name, he was writing it in numerical code.  It wasn't easy but I figured it out.  It spelled your name.
I'll go outside and take a look in the garage.
What's the bible for?
What are these?
What did he say to you in French?
And what's that mean?
I've filed a report with Father Frank.
We need all the help we can get.
Nothing you couldn't find out from reading the papers.  And you're already wrong on one count.
It's Detective Smythe.
We millionaires yet?
No, the less mystifying.  Good and evil are only illusions.  There is no such thing as evil with a capital "E."  That suggests some third party bad guy pulling all the strings.
Of course.
Really?  You know, seeing these guys away from the court, the facade slips. You catch things.
So you can see where you're going when you crawl up his asshole.
I'll quit, maybe you should start.
Hey, don't thank me.  Somebody up there likes you.
You got the right attitude, anyway, look, we gotta talk.
Yeah, murder-suicide.
Fine, you don't like this one, which one would you rather wear?
Tonight, don't worry about yesterday's game, the recruiters, or anything else. I just want you to enjoy being beautiful. Will you do that?
His mother had a cookout a few weeks ago. He could do a lot better if you ask me.
I don't remember that.
When I said Quincy could do better, I was thinking about you.
Thanks, sweetheart.
The doctor said it was okay.  Anyway, I'm still trying to lose some of this baby fat.
You're a caterer?
I thought Sidra's ankle was okay for next game.
Uh-huh.
It's okay.
Get used to it, babe.
To do what you love.
Don't make fun of me when I'm being wonderful and supportive.  You belong on the court.  Just like I belong in the stands, looking cute and cheering you on.
You lost your head.
Hey, don't take it personal.  And don't think just cause we play the same position we have to compete with each other.  We're teammates, okay?
I was just playing ball.
Just wanted to say good game.
Just one word of advice for next season.
Never let a freshman take your spot.
Just like that?
It's this big hole.  You could almost see bone.
Man, forget you then, stupid.
Last time they won, Dr. J. was a nurse.
Yeah, an honest tramp-ass ho.  But I guess you'll stick your dick in anything.
Who's Spalding?
Who said I'm not getting recruited?
I don't.
Figures.
None of your business.
Quit.
Plan to.
Right here.
I know he messed up, but that doesn't change what he's been to you.
I'm not up for running into anybody. Let's just kick it here, alright?
The "man" again.
What the hell's going on?
Talk to your new girlfriend.
So you fucked around to prove a point!
That night you wanted to talk about your Dad I had a curfew.  What was I supposed to do?
Damnitt, Monica.  This ain't about us anymore, it's about me.
Not for Quincy McCall.
A rest?
Nah.  I haven't dribbled a ball in four and a half months.  Maybe I miss some of the attention, but besides that...
Something was just missing.
What I'm trying to say is, I've loved you since I was eleven and the shit won't go away.
So you're gonna bitch up?
If I lose, I'll buy you a wedding present.
I've been hearing you.
Twenty-seven points, eleven assists and still undefeated.
Sorry.  You okay?
Don't sweat it, okay.  Sooner or later the truth'll come out.
Cause when you say can't, you ain't a man.
Let's hope I can say the same about you one day.
What mess?
Tell me what?
I want this thing to go to court, but my lawyer's telling me to settle.
A case like this could hang around for months and I'm up for this player relations job with the "Clips."  This gets out, false or not, no one'll touch me.
I messed up, okay, I know that.  But I ain't that kid's father.
Came by to check on you.
Oral surgery.  Corrective teeth surgery.
And the book says: "We may by through with the past, but the past ain't through with us."
No, no, no. I'm fine. It's small, I wanna keep going --
I'm telling you right now, I'm fine. I lost my goddamn balance and I couldn't see a moment, but I'm ok.
-- no,no,no what is this? who? What's this guy's name?
Does this sound weird?
I'd like to talk to you.  Your boyfriend let me in, I just knocked on the door --
No.  No.
I'm not lying to you, I'm not --
GET OUT.
GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE.
It's the LAPD, can you open the door, please?
-- listenin' to that music so loud: You Tryin' To Damage Your Ears?
Was it a boyfriend of yours?
Bit messy.
I'm a bit of a slob myself.
Yeah...it's not...it's been on for a bit --
That'd be fine.  So, Claudia, lemme just say, so I can get my role of LAPD officer out of the way before we enjoy our coffee  I'm not gonna write you up or anything, I'm not gonna give you a citation here -- but the real problem we have is that there are people around here, people that work from their homes, people tryin' to get some work done, and if you're listenin' to your music that loud:  They're incovenienced by that.  If you had a job you'd probably understand, but I see you like listenin' to your music and that's fine, you're just gonna wanna keep it down at a certain volume, maybe memorize what number you see on the dial and just always put it to that -- If it's the middle of the day -- that's what I do -- just put it on two and a half and that's a good listening level, alright? I see you like listenin' to your music loud, but, hey, forget about the neighbors, you end up damaging your own ears ok?
It's not -- what's a 422?
If you're not here for a 422 --
What is it?  Did you forget something?
I thought you were flirting with me a little.
No, I'm off tonight.  I would lov-like, to go tonight, I can pick you up, I can pick you up here at about what time?  What time?
What about ten o'clock, is that too late?  I don't get off and then --
Well I don't go out very much.
I'm sorry.
It doesn't matter.
I should maybe go to the bathroom.
I don't know.
Jesus Christ, Stanley, you can't go to the bathroom now.  You have exactly one minute before we're back on the air, this is NOT the time to go to the bathroom.
We're not gonna do that now.  We're not gonna do that now and that's over.
Son, please, now....
Please, boy, put it down and it's ok.
No Can Do.
I can help you solve the case, I can tell you who did it.
I'm a rapper.
Fine.  Phil, you still there?
I have love all over.  I even have love for you, friend.
Well --
Yes they do, they do, but I'll make my dreams come true, you see?  I will.
Mmm.Hmm.
Stay that way.
FUCK YOU.  I pay you, I paid you. I give you a fucking chance and a chance and over and over, over you let me down.  I trust you with so much. The keys to my store, the codes to my locks, the life, the blood of my bussiness and return is smashing in seven-eleven, late, <u>always</u> late, loans -- I loaned you money for your kitchen that you never did --
It's...doesn't matter....
Don't do this, Don.
You were gonna ask me weren't you?
Well that's what Hospice will take care of for you.  They will send a nurse, someone who can take care of all of that for you --
We can fix that, because I can give you -- are you listening?
Fuckin' bullshit is what this is.
No.
She loves you.
How come every word you say is either "cocksucker," or "shitballs," or "fuck?"
I'll get you another pain pill. Another morphine pill --
Who are you gonna call?
-- it's not him. it's not him. He's the fuckin' asshole...Phil..c'mere...
What?  Say it again...walking in the car?
I'm looking for Frank Mackey.
You got us a room so quick?
Is that still lingering?
I know alotta women and I'm sure she remembers me.
Go ahead and waste your time.
And that's what you've heard?
She's my mother.
...this close...
I don't how much I went -- but I was enrolled.  I was such a loser back then. I was -- misguided, pathetic -- I was very fat. Not even close to what I am today. Not the Frank TJ Mackey you're eager to talk to because I was swimming in what <u>was</u> as opposed to I <u>wanted</u>.
He's...I'm sorry...so sorry...I've seen this before, you know and you don't.... He's going very fast....Frank...um....
I just...he was...but I gave him, I just had to give him a small dose of liquid morphine.  He hasn't been able to swallow the morphine pills so we now, I just had to go to the liquid morphine... For the pain, you understand?
Um...soon tonight...I think, yes? Tommorrow...I mean...very soon...very...
Oh yeah.
Uh. huh.
yeah.
The door was open, I got a call --
OK.  That's true.  Is anyone else, besides me and besides you in this house?
I'm not askin', Marcie.
Mischief?  What the fuck you talkin' about, mischief?
I don't have to do a god damn thing.
Marcie - CALM DOWN. CALM DOWN and don't do this. I want you to stay --
THERE'S NO ONE IN THERE. STAY OUT OF MY MOTHERFUCKIN BEDROOM.
Did your wife find out?
I got in trouble at school.
Fifteen minutes ago, where were those cards?
I need you to get me Paula --
As fast as I can.
I don't know.  I have to go, I don't have time and I have more drinking to do before I go march --
Yeah.
Paula.  Ellen.
Well maybe.
Why, well I think we've, we both don't know...what do you mean?
Do you know the answer to this?
I think that she thinks I may have molested her.
I don't know.
I really don't know.
Stay here, please don't leave me, please, please, if I said I knew would you stay?
Hello.  Is Claudia here?
Yes.  What's your name?
It's alright.
No.
What's MOW?
If I talk to you...y'know...if I tell you things...then you're a lawyer, right? You can't say things, you can't tell anyone, it's like the privelage, right? Attornery-client, you understand?
-- unless Frank is specifically ommitted as a beneficiary that's what will happen.
I'm trying to help, Linda --
You need to sober up.
What are you doing?
mmmhmm.
Do you have that?
Yes. What? Yes.
Maybe.
I gotta go to the bathroom.
I didn't know the answer --
I'm fine. I'm fine, I just wanna keep playing --
Hi.
It's ok.
....Why does he do it...?
I can take you to get money.  I don't need it...I don't <u>need</u> it -- listen to me: I can let you have money so your father won't hit you ever again -- you'll have the money because I don't need it.
And you were not hurt?
If I don't kiss you, I die anyway.
I couldn't tell you.  You had enough to carry.
I wish to discuss your brother.
Next week.  This is a mere garden party -- and I wish to join it, so I will be brief.  I am experiencing resistance from the Jesuits.
Once a Musketeer, always a Musketeer, eh?
Soon enough.  Here we are.
Tomorrow.
Yes, and he has a choice!
In a year, maybe two, I could teach him enough to --
I offer you the perfect revolution. A revolution without bloodshed, without any loss of life, even without treason, for he too is the son of the King.
Aramis -- the King wishes to see you.
We have grown wiser with age.  Now we know that some problems cannot be settled with a sword.
I trained those men myself.  They will stand and fight.  But if we are to die, let it be this way.
There are more important things than tits.
Can't you see I'm praying, goddammit?!
Easy to say, but hard to do.  For what I am trying to tell you is that I am the Governor General of Jesuits in France.
I expected action.  There was no killing, no fighting, I was useless.
I carried the king's child!  The queen had twins that night, and one of them was sent away, in secret!
Who?
Never mind, Papa, it doesn't matter now.  She loved me once.  I want to die remembering that.
Midnight!  Mon dieu!  Driving the youngsters hard, eh?
I fear I know our King.  I came to try to bring you hope.
Get out of my way.
What is its antidote?
It is something I have done -- or did not do.
I did not share beauty with someone... who is no longer here for me to share beauty with.
Just... water.
Who came?
And you never knew why?
Let us play a game, d'Artagnan, let us pretend I am King and you are Captain of my Musketeers.  Let us behave as if my wish is law.  And my wish is to enjoy this party!
It is for your security that I have come, your Majesty -- for the security of your honor.
In his mind, anyway, and soon enough in hers.  She had written him many letters of love.
Your Majesty has had many women --
Not criticize -- plead.  Love.  Love your people, and you will not bear to see them hungry.  Love women, and they will love you.  Love yourself, and --
At least help Raoul.
Yes, your Majesty.
My twin.  Which has kept him alive. Until now.
Get out of my way.
Forgive?!
They have plotted against me!  Me! The embodiment of God's will!
I must insist, Sire.
No.  Even if I could give up my friends, I could never give up my son.
Thank you, Keeper.
Not by you.  I will order d'Artagnan to do it.
Well yes, of course, Majesty, and I'm sure they are content... except that... well, they are starving.
It's lovely.  It's just...
If what you're saying is true, then why would he have killed two police officers? A man like that would want to lay low, if he was planning some kind of damn sabotage mission!
What do you need?
You set to go -
It happened too fast.  He was in the back, quiet and calm and boom! He was out - and gone.  We...we fanned out...Stanton must have let his guard down!
Right behind you.
Did you start out area six?
It's just...catching up with me, you know?
Her prints belong to Stephanie Field, convicted for soliciting two years ago.
Figure you would have tried it already.
You'll find out - soon enough.
I had to get away!  My life was in danger!
Six months ago, a police lieutenant named Charles Fletcher was found dead in a hotel room - he blew his brains out - left no note, you may have heard of it...
Yeah.
Hello Tubbs.  Can I come in?
I killed them.
No thanks.  How do you know they can't catch you on this thing?
How about Marvosa and the others?
Well, you saved me from a bad situation. Thanks.  I admit this is...unusual.
Are you serious?  My boyfriend ditched me...
Not with this...
Did you have sex with her?
Did you have sexual intercourse with the woman in question?
I need to ask you questions of a psychological nature.
You're never alone in a room with Graham, are you? You're smooth about it, but you're never one-on-one with him. Why's that? Do you think he's psychic?
What's the bottom line?
The usual motivation doesn't apply to him, nor the way he uses them.  I don't have an answer for you.  Listen to me, my friend: leave this.
When do they go to press?
Read it.
I need to talk to you about Will Graham.
I think there has been a lot of bullshit about the way I think.  I came down here to get away from all that.
Why?
The mark? Yes.
Wait, Will...
When I'm done.
What?
He had to.
Have him peel the top label back.
I want a chopper on the roof in three minutes. To Meigs Field.  At Meigs have them warn up and flight- prep the Gulf Stream.
This is our boy...!
What?
Wait for the back-up! Will?
They got shot a Telex. They're on if now...
In eight days.
No, thanks. I manage very well.  I'll order you twelve hundred feet: of 1000 C tomorrow.
It's a surprise.
Yes, are you okay...?!
No! Don't go back into the house...  It's too nice outside.
I have work to do at the plant.
It's me.
Shut up. Stop. Stop it.
I want her! I want her alive...  I'm going to keep her! YOU HEAR ME!!!
Was I in an accident?
I'm very scared.
I don't know...
No.
'I have had a great privilege. I have seen with wonder the strength of the Red Dragon. All I wrote about him before was lies from Will Graham. He made me write them. Now I understand.  'Will Graham: you will learn from my own lips how much you have to dread. Because I was forced to lie, he will be more merciful to me than to you.  'I will be a testament to the truth, now.  About his work. About his becoming.'
It's written on toilet tissue.  'My dear Dr. Lecktor, I wanted to tell you I'm delighted that you've taken an interest in me. I know that you alone can understand what I'm becoming.  'I know you alone understand the reality of the people who die to help me in these things, understand that they are only elements undergoing change to fuel the radiance of what I am becoming.  Just as the source of light is burning.  Mr. Graham, there's a hole torn and punched out, then it says...  'I have a complete collection of your press notices.  I think of them as unfair. As unfair as mine. The "Tooth Fairy." What could be more inappropriate.  Investigator Graham interests me.  Very purposeful looking. I hope we can correspond.  There's another piece missing here. I'll read the bottom part.  'After I hear back from you, I might send you something wet.  Signed: Avid Fan.  It has teethmarks pressed in it at the bottom.
How long can you keep Lecktor out without him getting suspicious?
Describe exactly what you think he did to Mrs. Leeds and I'll tell you if you're right or not.
What did he want?
And you said?
We have it good, don't we?
Tell me about yourself.
It's what Kevin called her when he was little...
You got a deal...
Well, how you doin', Mr. Graham?! You sure are in the center of a storm. Burning up lots of taxpayer's dollars, too, I bet.  On the news they said he was a white man. He isn't really, is he?
Yeah...
In this hatchery? Forty to fifty.
No. It's just my job to find him.  I was in the hospital after Garrett Jacob Hobbs.
Hobbs was insane. He was attacking college girls and he killed them.
With a knife.  I found a curly piece of metal in the clothes of one of the girls. The kind of shred a pipe threader makes. I was taking a look at steam fitters, plumbers. It took a long time. In one place there was a resignation letter from a man named Hobbs. I saw it and it was..., peculiar.  I was going up these stairs to Hobbs' apartment. I was halfway up when he shoved his wife down at me. She was dying.  I sent the officer with me to call a SWAT team. But I could hear kids in there and screaming. I couldn't wait.
...after a while.
You've read the transcript. It's all there.
It's about Atlanta and Birmingham.
Do you know how you caught me, Will?
What do you want?
It feels good because: if you do as God does, enough times, you become as God is: powerful...
Yes.
I'm not a comedian.  I have no talent.  I'm a song-and-dance man.
"No"?  "No" to which part??
I told you, I'm not a comedian.  And sitcoms are the lowest form of entertainment: Stupid jokes and canned laughter.
I refuse.
He's a Vegas entertainer.  I used to do impressions of him.  We sorta... got in a fight over that.
Okay... I'll go back.  But just let them know, first they ain't gettin' Latka.  They're gettin' Tony!
But George, I like to push the boundaries...
There'll be other shots.
No, I'm not gonna take it.  If I take it I'll break my back.
WRONG!  You haven't given them any clues that it's a parody!
Andy!  You don't get it!  They don't want you back.
Andy... it's me.  I've got some crummy news.  Taxi's been canceled.
No clubs.  I wanna reach the TOP!  Carnegie Hall...!
But it's only for thirty seconds!
Deal.
Okay, great!  So let's reset!
No no no, it's not sex!  I mean -- it can lead to sex... but really, it's just wrestling.
Buzz off.  Go patronize somebody else.
No thanks.
Hey, I love movie theater popcorn... but that doesn't mean I have to sit through "On Golden Pond."
Gosh.  Gee, Lynne... I was just so impressed with your wrestling moves.
Because Memphis is the wrestling capital of the world!  I'll go in the ring, and I'll announce that I will shave my head and marry any woman who beats me!  Then you'll come up, we'll wrestle and I'll let you win!  Then you'll scalp me, and we'll get married on Letterman, like Tiny Tim did on Carson... right there on the show!  What do you say???
I-I'm sorry.  I got caught up in the action...!
No, NO!  Not yet.  I feel bad -- I've jerked 'em around so many times.
Don't worry!  The kids will love it --
DON'T TOUCH ME!
Then your father's a wimp.
Oh George, this is Bob Zmuda.  Bob and I have been buddies for years.
Are you nuts?!  40 million people watch you every week!
Nah.  The girls sponge off between johns.
Boy, they totally fell for it!  I'm only acting crazy!
Yeah, my problem is you're tired.
Sure, because your new stuff's a bunch of crap.  Kaufman, people are sick of you.  The wrestling... the hoaxes...
Who gives a shit?!  It's not funny!
I dunno.  If they were, they'd be pushin' 80.
Um, yes.  I haven't fought with them, since I started here.
I stopped drinking.  I gave up drugs.  And I'm meditating three hours a day.  It's the center of my life...
The wrestling... the sexist remarks... the foul language... these things are not becoming of an enlightened individual.  It seems you have no respect for anything.
It is apparently not working.
Doctor, I think I need a neck brace.
Eh, sure.  We're trying to expand our audience base -- and I know the college kids really love Andy Kaufman.
I don't know what yer talkin' about. You musta talked to someone else --
Look... I don't know what your problem is...
He said he's coming back!
Who knows?!  That kid is totally meshuga.
Why isn't he MOVING??
What's your name?
Oh shit.
No, Lieutenant, your men are already dead.
It's Choi.
The Matrix?  Yeah.
Really?
How?
Any time.
I need an exit!  Fast!
Shit!  Apoc?
They'll be able to track it.
He's beginning to believe.
I've been looking for you, Neo.  I don't know if you're ready to see what I want to show you, but unfortunately, we have run out of time.  They're coming for you, Neo. And I'm not sure what they're going to do.
There's a small ledge.  It's a short climb.  You can make it.
There are only two ways out of this building.  One is that scaffold. The other is in their custody.  You take a chance either way.  I leave it to you.
The agents --
... Yes.
Because I don't like the idea that I'm not in control of my life.
Far from it.
She is a true psychic.  She sees beyond the relativity of time.  For her there is no past, present or future.  There is only what is.
Why?
No.  I did not.  I have never told anyone this, Neo.  After I saw the Oracle I thought... no, I misunderstood what she told me.  I believed that it was all about me. That I would find the One, not that he would find me.
Ten hours straight.  He's a machine.
Do it!
What?
How do you know that name?
Who are you?
Trinity?  The Trinity?  The Trinity that cracked the I.R.S. Kansas City D-Base?
It disables any electrical system in the blast radius.  It's the only weapon we have against the machines.
That's different.
A black cat went past us and then I saw another that looked just like it.
Yeah?
It wasn't fast enough.
No.
What are you talking about?
Hurry, Neo.
Yeah.  But he ain't here now.
Thanks.
Well, we're here for about two weeks, then whatever else comes along... we're still working on our album and...
Look fella...this is private...
Hey!  You want good stuff, or you want shit?
Well, maybe they do that in Riverdale, but down here we take cash.  Now, you got it or not?
All right!  Quiet!  For $40 I could give you...
'Take a little tip from Mack the Knife...'
Anybody wanna have a game?
And say what?
Not quite...but keep trying.
Johnny, you're a real jerk-off.
Don't worry.  I can handle it.
There won't be any this week.
Didn't show up.
Yeah, take it easy.  Will you relax.
Oh, that's too bad, Teresa...
Don't be smart.
I'll be here.  Don't worry.
I don't understand, where's Groppi?
My uncle figured that this week was bad...but about next week...I dunno. Maybe you should speak to him yourself.
I'd like to know Charlie, it looks like your little friend is trying to duck me...
Nothin'.  Just stiffed those kids. Don't want'em comin' back and findin' you...start asking you questions.
Whatever.
Yeah, where's the rest?
You're not going to use that gun, Johnny.
I know.
Hostess?
Why not here...Ok nevermind...6th Avenue and Waverly.
Yes, you did.
Well, he was always a little crazy... he puts a gun in his mouth...  ...like your friend...comme si chiama...Henning?  Heming?
All right.
No, c'mon...Y'know, I read.
Charlie, couple of courses isn't enough to get you student deferred... I mean if they wanted to draft you, you would've been drafted by now.
Oh, that's ok...I've been in and out of this place fifty times.
Well...
It's all right.
Did you?
You missed the point.  The kid's a climber...not very bright...but if you get down to his level to look at it his way; he kills a guy who insulted a big man - he gets a reputation.  He thinks he's in good standing.
Not sick...just stupid.  Speaking of stupid, your cousin last night was feeling so good he decided to break into your mother's house...to get some food.
A paper on that one too?
You're intolerable today.
Uhuh...probably a good idea.  Why don't you do it this time?
Now don't get excited.  Don't get excited!!
Charlie...I've got to see you.  I want to talk...
Which one, the big tab or the little tab?
Sal!... fourteen street.
No...no.  Nooo...it's just that I...I...uh... this ain't my car.
You could say that.
Of course!  A double for Michael, Tony.
Nothing's going on.  Maybe he doesn't want to be alone.  He's go- ing to be sixty-five in a minute --
Well, maybe next time Joe goes, he'll take us along.
Hi, Allison --
Not much more.  Big day in the big city.  What's on your mind?
And you could care less --
I like it.  I like it.  I'm sorry I don't seem more appreciative.
It's for the party, Dad --
'Goddam party'!
Yeah?  And what about my enemies?
-- The late harvest Riesling, Mr. Quince, a possibility for dessert.
Pinot Grigio.  We're considering it for the appetizer.
Hello.  I'm Joe Black.  Nice to meet you.
That may be.  But I don't like the fucker.  I don't like the way he looks at you and talks to you.  And vice versa.
Here...
Thank you.
Cold.
What an odd pairing.
Yes.
Susan's patient is whom we are talking about.
I'll make a note of it.  Anything else?
Not good, not bad, you know what we got?  Nothing.  No credit, no cars, no mortgages -- no wives.  Nothing.
-- And now you're going to pee some more.
A voice?
Oh, excuse me.  This is -- uh -- this is --
What?!
Uh -- he's from out of town --
I get the feeling you've done some business before.
I am now.
But the matter's still on the table, Bill --
I thought this was practically a done deal --
Yes, you made your feeling abun- dantly clear.  Now they want to do the same with theirs.
Yours.
Certainly, Bill.
But who is he?  What are his creden- tials?  What is his relationship to you?
I don't think they're ordinary.  I love keychains.
Doctor?  What could be wrong wit' you?
Hi, Jennifer.
Didn't the family get together last night --?
Hey, this is fun.
No problem.  I'll leave you two alone.  I can tell you guys have something on the fire --
And you're a nice man, Quince.
You're welcome.
You love Allison, don't you?
How did you meet?
'The deepest, darkest secrets --'?
You appear at his side out-of-the- blue, stay at his house, eat dinner with his family, it's practically a first.  You're in the red-hot center of big business and I thought you were a regular Joe.
Peanut butter.
How nice you look.  Is that your uniform?
Patients have visitors, not doctors.
Yes.
It comforts you, doesn't it?
I am, too.
We're doing what we can for her. But it doesn't look good.
Because guys who never say anything about themselves are always married.
Where are you going?
Then don't.
You want me to wait for you, you'll be back --
'Threw' you?  Where?
No.
'Feeling'?  I feel fine.  How do you feel?
Oh, I wouldn't tell them anything, Bill.  You'll ruin the good start we had last night.  I felt as if I were being treated like a person.  'Joe' this and 'Joe' that - a nice smile - Quince passed me the rolls -- no 'rapture' or 'passion' or any of those mighty things you seem so intent on imparting, but I am cer- tain, should you - uh - say - uh - who I am - our adventure would end abruptly.
And I won't tell anyone who you are.
It is a deal?
I'm sure you'll see to it that it won't be a problem.
I don't understand.
Are you sad, Bill?
Glad you like it.  My wife turned me onto cold lamb sandwiches.  Joan -- that was my wife --
Why didn't you stop me?
I don't know.
I wouldn't put it that way.
Hello.  Would you like to join me, Quince and Allison for a nightcap?
Goodnight.
Well, you goddam well should.  You walk into my life, give me the worst news a guy can get, have me dancing on the heads of pins with my busi- ness and with my family, and now you're spooning with my daughter.
Not at all.
Well, they're mine now.
Does she know where she's going?
It's time to put this person where he belongs.
I am not a dream.
You're not Death.  You're just a kid in a jacket and a pair of pants.
You fill the bill, Bill.
You should hope quite a while.
Of course.
'Yes' is the answer to your question.
I don't!
I'm sorry, I --
I'm here.
What the hell is this?  Who are you?
I want to have a look around before I take you.
Time.
In return you'll receive minuets, days, weeks, I'm not going to go into details ... what matters is that I stay interested.
The vodka.  What'd I tell you?
Yes, the big 'celebration' of my mandatory retirement birthday. You're an honored guest, Eddie.
No, I'm going to stay down here, keep my finger in the dike and maybe by Monday, the waters could recede.
Sorry, Bill, have a drink, eat your cake, blow out the candles and make a wish.  Talk to you Monday.  Okay?
But we want you back, Bill.  Mean- while, enjoy your party, celebrate, we'll attend to the nasty details. And Mr. Black, may we say thank you.
You like him, don't you?
...Then don't.
And I'm your daughter and no man will ever be good enough for me.
You're not listening --
Don't get dirty, Dad --
That's all?
Nothing.  I'm sorry.
Nothing.
When you say 'nothing' that way, it's not nothing.
It's something.
I'm having a helluva time.
Oh, yes --
Because I like you so much.  You have coffee here every morning, don't you?  If I came by, could you give me the name of a doctor?
Not to me! I wasn't fucking married to her!
That's it.
That must suck. All... backwards.				 *
Couple days.
As requested.
Seen you together, that's all.
Why?
Just two. So far.							  *
Yeah, well you're not gonna remember, anyway.
That's right I did, didn't I?
Thanks.
Interested in buying one?
I don't want blood on them.
Sorry, I should have explained. You see, I have this condition -
No. But the photo on his license looked familiar. I think he's been in the bar before
Yes.
Yeah. You?
Did you?
I know the feel of the world.  I know how this wood will sound when I knock.  I know how this glass will feel when I pick it up.  Certainties. You think it's knowledge, but it's a kind of memory, a kind you take for granted. I can remember so much.  I know the feel of the world,  and I know her.
They don't look too hard for guys like Jimmy.
I'll go see him.
No!
Maybe it is! How the fuck would you know?! You don't know a fucking thing! You can't get scared, can you get angry?!
Don't just waltz in here dressed like			  * that and order a beer.						  *
I don't remember. See, I have no short-			* term memory. It's not amnesia -				   *
We shouldn't even be talking this way while the case is still open to appeal.
Then why are you here?
Thank you.
Leonard, you don't have a clue what's going on. You don't even know my name.
That's who you were, you don't know who you are.
Lemme take you down in the basement and show you what you've become.
I don't remember.
So I see. It's good to see you. My name's Teddy.
You don't have to remember to be hungry.
Just for revenge. That's what keeps me going. It's all I have.
How'd ya get him in here in the first place?
Fucking hope not.
Yeah. I think it was your sinister mustache that got him.
Teddy. Your buddy.
The sort of questions you should be asking yourself.
The Jaguar's out front. You didn't even Bother to put it around back.
I'm a snitch. He's a cop from out of town looking for information. The local boys put us in touch.
No. Don't worry, I'm a cop. Everything'll be okay. Is he still breathing?
Well, I hope it's not as serious as his, 'cos this guy's dead.
Sammy didn't have a wife.
Are you sure?
I guess I can only make you believe the things you want to be true, huh? Like ol'		   * Jimmy down there.
Yes, I will.
Why do you keep lying to me?					 *
Quit it!							 * 					   * You're not a killer, Lenny. That's why			 * you're so good at it.						   *
You can't just take it!
Why would I have a gun?
His name's James F. Grantz, John G. Check		   * your tattoos.							 *
Fuck you; I gave you a reason to live and		   * you were more than happy to help. You lie		   * to yourself! You don't want the truth,			 * the truth is a fucking coward. So you			  * make up your own truth.						 *
Then that's it.  Change the mission statement. Crockett stays in.  He keeps working up the ladder.  The local importers get a pass for the time being.
Trudy and I are goin' for Gina...
Recruit us to do what?
José Yero changed-up the drop plan on us.  He's grabbed Gina.
You said Nazi Low-riders...?
...you'd be operating outside territorial United States.  Your badges do not count.  You have no authorization to carry weapons.  If you're busted, it could take a long time to get you re-patriated.  And there's no backup...  And you will share with them all your intel on Montoya...
Yes you do...
Okay.
Havana.
Are you afraid?  Good.  And you don't need a visa. Cause you're with me.
Angola.  My mother was being a surgeon there.  She volunteered. Mozambique and Mali, too...  ...those days, in those days...she was part of Cuba's gift to the third world.  She came from a bourgeois family with a house in Verdado...we still have the house. We will go there...
Angolan Military.  Went back to the fighting.  Disappeared.  Who knows...?
Cost less.  That's the point.
What do you mean?
Better than that.  We become partners.  Only in this territory and only on loads we run. And you don't pay us three thousand a ki.  You pay us zero.  Why we get is thirty percent of the load. Product or cash.  "And why," you're thinking, "would I be crazy enough to out in these gringos like that? Is he chipping?  Crazy for my love? Too many mojitas?"  And the answer is, "of course" but also "no.  It is because Sonny can deliver what no one else can."
I would say you're...  ...four percentage points away from a deal...
Hola, viejo.
Why?
I am not John Wayne.  There is no "S" on his chest.  We get down if the play calls for it.  But we are into business and making money.
He tried to..."do business"...with you.  Around ten.  His place.  Be there.
What'd Neptune tell you?
Something's wrong.
Transpo?  How they bringing the loads in...?
It says, "We do not fear you."  It says, "Fuck off and die."  It says, "We get down for recreation..."
What happened to the last transporter you <u>had</u>?
Five minutes...
And what does that level of spending on first-class, private- sector infrastructure signify to you?
Chill out Sonny.
Then you should.
Okay.  What's up?
"Buy and walk"?  "Buy and bust"? "Reverse undercover"?  What?
How do we do that?  Make a buy?  That went well...
From the North Valle area.  New. Low-level, we think.
Montoya.  We went to meet the village priest.  It turns into Alice in the fucking Vatican and here's the Pope...of the North Valle Colombia dope trade.
Haiti and Puerto Rico.  Money through Dubai and Geneva maybe.
...look after her.  Ask Rico to. Okay?  Do that for me.  I had to do it.  They had me from the gate. Do that.  Whatever you can do for them.  Okay?  Look what I did to them, Sonny...!
Haitian, Dominican, Russian, Israeli?
...what else, what else did he indicate to you?  I need to know everything he said.
But Miami PD wasn't part of the J.I.T.  And from what Alonzo said, he didn't give you up.
Good idea.  We'll grab a bite.
Nothing.  'Cause how you do delivery on the beach, I don't like.  Maybe this does not work.
Do we need this...?
Alonzo, you don't need to go home.
I got me two hundred twenty-four bucks of flat folding money...  He know what he can do with that chicken-shit day's pay. And if he ain't man enough to do it for himself, I be happy to oblige!
Top drawer. Maybe if you didn't call me ma'am, things would work out better.
You gonna beat me, Joe?
Oh, it ain't cheap. I mean, yeah, I'd say this was an all right shirt. Don't like to, uh, you know, have a lot of cheap stuff on my back.
For what?
For money for what?
Rico! Rico! Rico! Is that enough?  And keep your meat hooks off my radio.
The coat? A guy I did a favor once gave it to me. Christ.
The name's Rico, at my own father's grave, a man deserves some respect.
Yeah, well, so?
Don't say nothing about you either.
Well, what the hell, I got nothing better to do.
Don't need a comb.
And what?
No doctors. No, sir. Not me. Doctors are like goddam auto mechanics. Fix one-thing, unplug another. Operate for piles and while they're there, they unscrew your liver. My old man, for God's sake, wasn't any sicker'n I am when he went to the doctor.
I been thinking. I hope we're not gonna have a lotta trouble about my name down there. Because like what's the whole point of this trip anyway?
You just -- just -- what happened, you just had a little rest stop wasn't on the schedule.
Gin's okay.
This is terrible. I meet someone who -- then -- wait, I want to give you a present. For your trip. You'll let me please...
I gotta have more'n ten. I gotta have fifty-seven dollars.
Get down -- where?
No. You got it.
Is he all right!
Yeah, what do you think this is, the good USA? This is Turkey, man... ) It's a fucking accident here if you're innocent. And anyway... ...ain't nobody who's innocent.
KNOCK IT OFF!
You want to split your hernia again?
How's your hernia?
The prison, man. There was this German cat an architect in the hospital. He was helping the Turks build some shit round the place. I laid some bread on him and he let me copy them.
There's two ways out I figger - over the roof, but that's only one person, maybe two. The other way is Under.
Stop shitting me, man!
Bad. She couldn't make the trip. You know Her boy...  Susan told us before we got your letter. She's fine; she's trying to get the money to come back and see you, but...
For the money... )
He sells insurance for Metropolitan Life.
I'm Billy Hayes... At least I used to be.
Sit down a moment, Billy.  I'm afraid I have some bad news for you.
What do you mean?
Where is it?
Yeah.
It's a dead end. The Turks musta' sealed it up.
Yeah.
I want to cut his throat.
It's not important, just technical things. We make our case.  You were very good, you spoke well. The Judge like you. It look good. Don't worry.
Okay, Jeremy...go get Dr. Chris Raymond, will you?
Yeah, and a loudspeaker so you can yell "Epidemic! Epidemic! You're all going to die!"
Shit.
Please do.  He's a lonely guy.
Oh, you helped me here, all right, white boy.  You and your goddam memo. You needed to prove your point, uh?
Someone'd have to go to the switchroom, pull the coupling lever, that'll send us left and to the elevator.
What?
No way we can outrun 'em together. Move it!
We'll find him. We'll be back and find him.
Monks bottle their own wine. Don't they?
Fine, then I'm the bad guy. Jesus!
Fuck 'em.  They don't know what they're missing.
No.
That's camouflage...
That's it?
She used a baster.
Oh, Jesus.
Fuck! It broke the skin...
Sure.
How does a nice cup of cocoa sound?
I always say if you can't enjoy your own company, you're not fit company for anyone else.
You'll never realize what a rare treat you've given me.
The swearing, Paul.  There, I said it.
It's fine.
My daughter must be going nuts.
I was supposed to be home for her birthday three days ago.
Well, you can't believe everything you read in magazines.
I know how that can be.
No one--she just died--she slipped away, that's all.
Perfect.
I don't suppose I could have a little snack while I wait for the surprise?
Show me the way?
Yes.
I know this may be difficult for you, but it's for the best.
No big deal.
You're right. You're right. I don't know what I was thinking. I'll tell you what. It doesn't have to be published. Nobody ever has to see it. I'll just keep it for myself. No one will ever have to know it exists.
Oh, but Paul!  I don't think, I know! Now that you've gotten rid of that nasty manuscript, you can go back to doing what you're great at--  --you're going to write a new novel-- your greatest achievement ever-- Misery's Return.
I know you didn't mean it when you killed her, and now you'll make it right.
You just expect me to whip something off, that it?
Don't worry about that. You'll have total solitude so you can concentrate on your work.
Annie, what's the matter?
What? What happened to "I'll treasure whatever you do?"
--not fair?
I can't write this anymore.
I said that?
What?
Yeah, yeah...
My secret is I only use fresh tomatoes, never canned. And to give it that little extra zip, I mix in some Spam with the ground beef.
What?
Be my guest.
But the time is now. Soon others will come.
You did perfect. Except for one thing. This time we need two glasses.
What? What is it?
He might well be. But not the way they say. He didn't crawl out of that car by himself. You saw those dents on the door--someone pulled him out.
There's two kinds of people that drive around in old cars: the ones that can't afford new ones, and the ones who wouldn't give 'em up for anything in the world. That second bunch don't drive around with twenty- five-year-old dents.
Well, whoever she is, she sure likes to read a lot.
What do you expect to find? A story about a guy who drove his car off a cliff in a snowstorm?
What is it?
G'bye, Ms. Sindell.
No long-distance phone calls, Federal Express packages--anything at all out of the ordinary?
So do I...
I'm sure you're right.
Buster.
If I can.
No, no. Misery Chastain put braces on your daughter's teeth and is putting her through college, bought you two houses and floor seats to the Knick games and what thanks does she get? You go and kill her.
Paul, since you brought her up, I have to ask you this, or I'd be drummed out of the agents' union-- what about a non-fiction book? The truth about what went on in that house.
I am. Well, maybe not completely--
Well, you've thorough about it, at any rate.
Hugh, take care of the Nekhorvich memory card.
'Thief in the Night?'
What else?
Ulrich will be about.  He'll look after you.
If it'll make you feel any better I won't do it again.
In downtown Sydney for a start.
Then we got'em!
There guys are walking around with different halves of the same dollar bill?
Not for seven more minutes.
He's heading down the stairs, now..
How much longer before you can reach him?
No.  Should I?
Indeed.
At least you walked.
Not really.  I triggered the alarm..
Ethan Hunt.
Not revealing information doesn't necessarily make someone a liar.
You're not a liar.  Or you're an awfully good one..  ..this thing these blokes pinched..
And six billion in the world.
Can you think of a better one?
Then feel better!..
How can you possibly?  I've got to get right on the plane.  I'm leaving now.
Ethan, you take care of yourself, I'll take care of myself because if push comes to shove, I'm gonna bail - and without giving two week notice.
Ethan, tell me -
Oh Ethan!..
I'm infected with Chimera.  You know you don't have a choice.  Just do it now.
Dr. Vladimir Nekhorvich is dead.  So is his colleague, Gradski, but that happened earlier.  We had Nekhorvich on a flight from Sydney that crashed in the Rockies..
Twice.
Well you know Nekhorvich's history. You're the one who got him out of the Soviet Union was it still in bio- weapon business.
She sacrificed herself..
Aren't you even curious?  About why she did it?
Yes, I gathered as much.
By fire.  That's the best way, really.
I'm with an old friend now, Dmitri.
I'm fine..
She must still be on the property.
You've got the voice print, I'll get us in..
She's on the North Head Bluff - approaching the cliffs.  One klick away.
What's happening here?  You're dead!
I don't remember what happened!  We were at the bar, drinking, laughing -- having fun.
This is bullshit - we donít even know what Max looks like.
Ethan, if you knew about Jim?..Why..
All ten million.
May take a little time.
Krieger.
Walk, just walk.  Start walking.
If you're gonna do this again Claire, It's not gonna be on my watch.
Don't move.
Who is "they?"
Who is they, who is they?
No one sent me!  We're supposed to be back here at four o'clock, four o'clock, if we abort, we don't return here until four o'clock, 0-four hundred, four am, four o'clock --!
I'm going to answer it.
We need help, and we don't have time. They have to be local.
Sure...
You didn't have to.........
Itís all right, Ethan..youíll bring me back...wonít you...
Go secure.
Of IMF agents.  At the Embassy.  Tonight.
The arms dealer.
I see you've been out visiting the folks.
Certainly Ethan.
I don't know, Ethan. Suppose you tell me?
Information.
Profitable.
You're all kidding yourselves. Even with top of the line crypto.  Cray access. STU 3's --
Well my Mother was a little confused about how the DEA could mistake her and Uncle Donald for a couple of dope smugglers in the Florida keys.
Like Job?
I'm NOC.  Was.  <u>Now</u> disavowed.
Okay, use it.  But I suggest pack up first.
My contact is extremely shy.
What about my coat?  I'll freeze.
I don't know, I had to go to Chicago again.  You were in Kiev.  You tell me.
Ethan, you <u>can't</u> burn out.
Because I can't afford it. And because you'd burn up before you'd burn out.
Yeah, smaller countries don't computerize customs records -
And get a doctor.
But, he didnít know about you.  In all fairness, Ethan, Claire was never convinced her charms would work with you. But I was supremely confident - having tastes the goods.  "Thou shall not covet thy Neighbourís wife", Ethan.  Oh, Ethan is in love with you, Claire, make no mistake about it.  And like all the worldís lovers, heís tortured by the same, one pathetic question - "does she feel the same way I do?"
Ethan - Iíve always taught you, nothing can be more dangerous than the truth.  It can kill you.
I don't know.
Jack...that's spying.
I think I might just take that look.
And a lonely ass.
Connection denied.
You do, huh? Stick around. Don't go on any long trips.
I know you don't. That's the point. I'll say no more.
And that's how much I'm saying.
I won't come.
What'd you do to your hair?
Hurry up.
Yes.
I know that. I do what I want.
Loretta.
Instantaneous.
Why what?
No. Unlucky. I have not been lucky.
The big part of you has no words and it's-a wolf. This woman was a trap for you. She caught you and you could not get away.  So you chewed off your foot! That was the price you had to pay to be free.  Johnny had nothing to do with it. You did what you had to do, between you and you, and I know I'm right, I don't care what you say. And now you're afraid because you found out the big part of you is a wolf that has the courage to bite off its own hand to save itself from the trap of the wrong love. That's why there has been no woman since that wrong woman. You are scared to death what the wolf will do if you make that mistake again!
Oh. Oh God. I don't care about anything. I don't care about anything! Take me to the bed.
Me neither.
That light.
Don't just become excited.
She didn't like me.
I can't do that!
Yeah.
I was.
I got a lot on my mind, Aunt Rita.
Hi.
No?
Maybe you're right.
Bobo, take the cart away.
What do you mean?
You propose to a woman you should offer her a ring of engagement.
Seven-thirty.
I'll take care of it, Johnny. I'll take care of the whole thing. All you have to do is show up.
Not yet. I'm waiting till a moment when she's peaceful.
I have something to tell you. But I must talk to you alone.
If I marry you my mother will die.
Good. When you love them they drive you crazy cause they know they can. But you like him?
No.
Pop don't like Johnny.
I got married before, you didn't sell.
Not yet. That old lady makes him sweat.  Where's that card?
Just like your father. I lied to him. He thinks you came home last night.
No. Are you drunk?
I guess it ain't modern times in Sicily. He came right from the airport. He wanted to talk to you. You got a love bite on your neck. He's coming back this morning.
You gotta date?
Hi. Why ain't you at the store?
The bank. OH MY GOD, I FORGOT TO MAKE THE DEPOSIT!
Then it was not a sin. But what was that second thing you said, Loretta?
That's a pretty big sin.
My granddaughter wants my son to pay for the wedding. But he does not want to pay.
I don't know.
Then tell her I'll come by in the morning. We need to talk.
Johnny...
It was a miracle!
Could you do away with her dinner, and any evidence of her, and bring me an big glass of vodka?
What happened?
None of your business.
That woman was a student of yours?
Don't shit where you eat.
Good night.
Oh.
Is who down there?
Wait.  Wait ... tell me, what also floats on water?
I am...  And this my trusty servant, Patsy. We have ridden the length and breadth of the land in search of knights who will join our court at Camelot..  I must speak with your lord and master.
Well, it doesn't matter.   Go and tell your master that Arthur from the Court of Camelot is here.
NI!   NI!
That is a good shrubbery.  I like the laurels particularly - But there is one small problem.
We are now no longer the Knights Who Say Ni!
Oh, please!
What?
I have no quarrel with you, brave Sir knight, but I must cross this bridge.
I command you, as King of the Britons to stand aside.
No, it isn't.
Had enough?
No.  Ni!  More like this. "Ni"!
Then we'd best leave them here and carry on on foot.
It's the ... oh ...  it's the ... it's on the tip of my tongue ...
There are some who call me Tim?
Yes, I can help you with your guest.
How shall we find this cave, O Tim?
There.
It is the rabbit.
Yes, I see.
Be quiet!  I order you to shut up.
Bloody peasant! 
Course it's a good idea.
Do me a favour.
What is your quest?
I dunno, Must be a king.
I will send help, brave friend, as soon as I have accomplished this most daring, desperate adventure in this genre.
Didn't mean to?  You put your sword right through his head!
Camelot?  Are you from Camelot?
What - the curtains?
Listen, Alice ...
I was saved at the last minute.
Okay.  Fine.  We'll remain here until you get back.
What is your name, handsome knight?
Mine is Zoot. Just Zoot  But come.
I knew that someone would come.  I knew ... somewhere out there ... there must be ...
Stop saying it.  AAAArghh! ... I've said it ...
Well, It's got huge ... very sharp ... it can jump a... look at the bones.
Brave, Sir Rob ...
So, there are rules.  Things you do and things you don't do.
Come on, man.  There's love and there's ...
You know nothing about her!
I hope to go up next year.
Kitchen and lower house.
Your Royal Highness.  What a pleasure to see you here.
I don't think I've had that pleasure.
Of course.
Brown's responsibilities are onerous enough already.  He has far too much to do without having to stay up all night waiting for you to go to bed. The smoking-room will be closed and the lights put out at twelve o'clock.
Not now he doesn't.  This is my place.
My own.
Back and upper corridors.
Aye, do.
I believe that decision rests with Her Majesty.
I don't doubt that the Queen was highly amused.  She has always had a very healthy sense of humor.
A man can refuse only so many invitations from his Queen.  It was remiss of me not to come earlier.
What I do, I do for my Queen.
Maybe, once.
In time, she will.
Because I think Her Majesty is wrong. If ever there was a poor soul who needed fresh air, it is her.
I'll decide when it's exaggerated.
Yes, ma'am.
Have I ever let you down before--?
For god's sake, woman, I'm just trying to keep you safe!
Then why send me back to them?!
Someone has to look after you.  It could've been someone.  It was before.
Not at all, Dean.  Good of you to spare the time.
You've seen the latest cartoon in Punch, I take it?
It's questionable whether there's any advantage to be had from that direction.  She's never been less popular.
Not too protracted, I hope.
Whom?
Of course, at once.
Why?
Again?
I -- forgive me, ma'am, I am no wiser than yourself.
Your Majesty --
What is it?
My family is quite capable of communicating with the Queen in person.
They are demanding the dismissal of John Brown on grounds of drunkeness.
Yes, ma'am.
Prince Albert is at Windsor, ma'am.
Sure.  Every game's got 'em.  I'll start with the schematics.  I can print these up if you want.
It's the game's logic core.  We actually patterned it after human brainwaves.  I mean, there's a personality in there. That's what makes it so incredible.
Did you play ARCADE last night?
I came from the city on the left.
Yeah...
Hey, kid.
How?!  It's a machine, Alex. Machine's don't think.  They're not alive.  It's a good program, a brilliant program, it was designed so it would act as if it were alive, but it's not alive.
It's the middle of the night.  They're asleep.  Phone didn't wake them.
We can't...
It's already out.
And beat it at it's own game.
Drives 'em crazy every time.
What are you going to do?
Everything.
You didn't hear me?
A way to hook this helmet into the game. I'm sure there are interfaces...
What?
We're actually inside, aren't we?
Got it.
You've got the schematics, check.
Hold my keys, then.
In this world, wrong is right!
Is that your question?
Of course I am.
The game will guide you.
Sign me up.
Someone called me. When they couldn't get you they told me you were as good as broke. I didn't believe then, so I made some calls.
You gotta be kidding?
Yeah, sure. It is that kind of a day. When?
No problem. What's on your mind?
I agree with what you said...truly.
One.
You're an understandin' fella.
I'm sorry Mr. Kesher, but there seems to be some problem concerning your credit card.
The fact is Mr. Kesher a representative of your bank called us.
Have a good evening, Mr. Kesher.
Yes, he is. He raises corn.
You probably don't remember her, but Louise Bonner lives right over there in number 29. When she isn't drunk she runs a damn good acting class.
It's just for a night or two, until she finds her own place. I tried to explain that to Aunt Ruth, but the connection was bad and her plane was leaving and she got it all mixed up. I kept telling her it was my friend and she kept saying she didn't know any Ritas ...
So I guess your Grandpa and Grandma know her.
Don't make me out to be a sucker. Louise Bonner says there's trouble in there. You remember last night. Sometimes she's wrong, but if there is trouble - get rid of it.
Naw! He wouldn't have cared. Just give him a good performance and he'll be happy and I've got a feeling you'll do just that.
Hi...do you work with my Aunt?
Yes, there was.
Diane?
I...I mean......I...it's none of my business.
All right, but...I'm going to check on you.
I don't know who I am.
You don't remember anything else?
Just to see if there was an accident on Mulholland Drive.
Maybe it's not me.
"My parents are right upstairs! They think you've left..."
Good luck!
Okay.
C'mon help me in. I'll open the front door.
What ... I..HAVE... to do.
Gotta keep an eye on her, that's all.
Nothing... I don't like being out in the open like this.
This Denny's.
Okay, so you had a dream about this place. Tell me.
Could be unrelated.
Handstitched Italian. Filled with phony credit cards ... off the two guys in the Caddy.
Interesting.
Where at?
Where's the dock ?
Jesus, my legs are asleep. I'll never be able to win this shit.
Good. Nice to see you, Bruce. Johnny.
Leave him, he's dead.
I don't know.
Give me a fucking.....
I'M NOT BOFFING MATTHEW !
I'm not listening.
You've been doing a bang up job so far. Right now Matt is probably dead and it's your fault.
Then how come Matt and I showed up as guilty ?
I've since changed my mind. I designed this place, based on my belief that I was doing what the legal system couldn't or wouldn't do. McCay had the company buy the property and they pay the bills. It's a tax write off. On the books everything looks kosher. I have an office on 5th that I haven't seen in ten years.
So was I. So don't give me any shit. Your business is just as bad. At least I'm up front about it. You kill people slowly. Your corporate take overs can decimate a families livelihood over a year sometimes two. Now you know how it feels.
Okay.
The Brooklyn Bridge.
Yes.
It'll end. It'll end with him and McCay. Then the park shuts down. Permanently.
That's a shame.
Well, I'll see you at the next staff party.
Yes, can I help you ? Maybe a donut or something ?
43 unpaid parking tickets, sir.
Not quite....
Yeah, we're about a hundred an fifty feet below the subway stations. We're heading a little higher up now.
That's cute asshole.
Let's just see if he can make it into round two....
What ?
Yes, sir Mom. 
Not yet.
I just want to double check the facts.
Matthew lives on the Upper West Side, kinda posh for a temp don't you think ?
I thought that was Darwin, sir. Or perhaps Nietzsche ?
While I am not morally against these little, shall we say "hobbies", as long as I am on the payroll, but why not something like a yacht club ?
I am thirty two.
Yes sir.
I had suggested that they tone down the program so that the "guests" might take longer to expire.
That's right, sir. He does a thorough background check and if he finds them to be criminal or guilty of embezzlement, then he will put them in the park. He has refused the last three suggested "guests".
Sir, he created the Park. He would know how to circumvent any of the traps.
What then sir ? What would we do with the park with out Bruce ?
Better, sir.
Fantastic ! A little faster sweetheart.
I'm just looking for our best interests. May I have the tapes, Bruce ?
There was a bit of confusion on one of my last jobs.
I'm listening.
What ?????
I don't know.....
I can see your small business ! Look at it it's so small.
Shit, I forgot about them. Well, I guess the boss man wasn't as tough as I thought.
You're paying the bills.
I can see that but where ?
Sure.
Hi. I brought some wine.
Thank you.
If they're so rich, why are you working at all ?
Yahoo !!!!!
Fine, fine, I feel like a chicken McNugget.
We just having our first date when you showed up.
Hey buddy. You okay ?
Actually it's down .2 from the last quarters highest, but I think it will pick up.
I disagree. I think we should start looking into the severance pay schedules and make sure the people with families can.....
Oh, just put it over there.
Hey relax, you think I kidnapped him or something?
Well if I was looking for a victim, I definitely wouldn't pick your Uncle Phil who outweighs me by about 150 pounds, besides, who would I ask for ransom? You??
What are you gonna do? Tell them that...a polite person helped carry your bag?
I think the phrase was &quot;Sleazoid Geek&quot;.
You're still asking me to break the law.
Hello, I'm gonna need this right now...this guy...well we think he might be going after the governor.  Twenty minutes? Fine.
I don't know if I can picture Uncle Phil body surfing.
Well the thing is your room is right next door to ours, and so we thought, well, I thought, if you were willing we might move you to Grammoo's room, and use your old room for the nursery. See we're gonna be up half the night with a newborn and there'll be a lot of noise....
Well you know what I mean.
No it's okay, I understand, really.
Honey, ahh, guys don't wanna appear over anxious, so if you think there's a boy that might like you, let him know that you like him, so he won't feel he's taking such a risk when he's thinking of asking you out.
Well, I kinda just blurted it out over a root beer float.
Of course.
Honey I know it's fun to think about these things but....
What??
It means...I'm a paranoid nitwit who's never let his baby girl out of his sight for the simple reason he's a paranoid nitwit. So why don't you just say &quot;Oh Dad&quot; and get on the damn plane already?
Have fun.
Totally groovy huh?
I love you too sweetie, bye.
Listen, if a boy wants to do homework with you, it really means he didn't have nerve to ask you out on a date, so you'll get your homework together and pretend to be studying, and the next thing you know you're ordering pizza and talking about your favorite movie stars.
Yes I know, it runs in the family.  New book?
How about a nice glass of milk?
Oh honey, back then...people did crazy things.
I'd like to, thanks.
Does she?
Yeah like, switching a lamp on and off when she was talking about lightning...audiences love stuff like that. And your mom knew how to work an audience.
I've got something better.
More than anything in the world.
Well...
You should be here when they bring in a body that's been dead for a couple of days, and they haven't found it yet, 'cause it was in an apartment, and no-one came to visit, or floating in a river, and then the body starts turning this weird shade of green, you know, like watery pea soup? The arms and legs deteriorate first, the body looks like a raisin with four fat legs. Anyway, this is why I'm seriously considering cremation. Judy??
Oh God, he's coming over here, act natural, totally natural.
Hi, wanna help me pick out wallpaper for my new room tomorrow?
But I wanna write about her.
That's simple. She was pregnant with me...when she went to Russia and she didn't know...and then when the Russians found out, they waited to shoot her 'cause you're not allowed to kill pregnant women anywhere in the world.
Ehh...I'm staying at the chateau and the guy who runs the garage there said that you're the best Jag people in town...so uhm.
I'm Sam Helburn. Sam.
The poem is really about attitude. It's about not giving up and...it's easy to be overwhelmed sometimes but...that's when we should...force ourselves to push on.
I won't.
No THANKS!
Yeah, RIGHT.
TAXI!!!
WHAT??
And I thought I was weird.
I want it back now. I never should have taken it off, I want it back.
Big deal.
But we wouldn't really be related right?
Good. I mean...
I already did, it's a totally barbaric custom...but on you, it looks good.
This has been a real confusing day.
Some sacrifices are worth it.
I'd consider it a personal favor.
Ahh, that's right, like one big happy family. This is Nick's room and uhh....
That's ridiculous, I'm...I'm very, umm, what do you call it?
Vada, I know that traditionally you're not supposed to do a lot of these things before you're officially married...but these are very, very special circumstances.
Then we'll keep driving...you'll decide.
Phil for God sake.
You know exactly...what kind it is. Come on Rose...what do you want from me?
When did you umm, I mean umm...
No. You know they say, that it never rains, that you can barbecue on Christmas day...instead of riding your bike, you just surf over to your friends house. Oh, and the place is just crawling with celebrities. I know someone who saw Walter Matthau picking up his dry-cleaning.
What do you mean?
O.K.
Well, thanks for your help Mr. Rosenfeld and I'm sorry my mother wouldn't go out with you, I'm sure she would have had a really great time.
No, I gotta go to the cemetery, keep your head up. Don't look at the ball, look at me.
All right, here.
WHAT?
It's her home! It's where she lives!!
Hi Ralph. Oh Danny, how'd you find me here?
What?
Yeah, all right...
Vada Sultenfuss?? Tough break.
That can't be, I have all the classic symptoms.
I think it's still available.
Uhh, Miss devoto, these people are already at ease. This is not a Beauty Parlor, it's a Funeral Parlor.
Pardon?
Great, you can start right away. Call me Harry. Now, umm, is this what you'd normally wear for work? Don't get me wrong, I like it, very much, but the....
This was the Reverend Porter's wife, you have her looking like a two dollar hooker.
It's no big deal.
Oh, how do you mean?
What happened to her?
Here?
Goodnight.
Really?
Is it really your camper?
Pointing upwards Look...
Vada, just put 'em on the stool.
Last month you wanted to play the violin. Then you wanted to be a ventriloquist.
What?
You never cared before.
Why?
Can I go too?
Hey guess what? We're going to the carnival tonight, be ready to go in 10 minutes.
I told him not to tease those bees. Did he get stung?
What??
Ahh, that little Chevy was your mothers favorite car.
Uh huh. You know what your mother did when she found out she was gonna have you? She came home and painted this whole room pink. She was so sure she was gonna have a little girl.
That's good, memories are good sweetheart. Vada, I'm sorry; I was trying to keep it from you, I just couldn't. You're a good girl, and I want you to be happy; don't be an old grump like me.  Seeya in the morning.
Nothing, I'm dressing.
Thank you. Bye.
Me, two hours a week, talking about poetry. This an interrogation Vada?
It's summer! You're kids! Go play!
Loads of ice-cream by Vada Sultenfuss I like ice-cream a whole lot, It tastes good when days are hot, On a cone or in a dish, This would be my only wish, Vanilla, chocolate or rocky road, Even with pie a la mode.
Do you think she is?
You know what I think? I think Vada's very lucky to have a friend like you.
He likes her.
Well he wasn't one of the Marx brothers, but he made me laugh.
I am.
Uh huh.
Yes, Vada I think you're very pretty. You've got these great big sparkling eyes, the cutest little nose, an amazing mouth.
Hi.
This is Danny and Ralph, they own the Dino Raphael salon in Detroit.  We used to be married.
Oh great!!
Well he just left, what's wrong?
What do you mean you're hemorrhaging?
I'll pay it back, besides, I don't think i'll ever go to class again.
Liverpool?
Why? It's not dinner time yet.
It's only black when you're around 'cause you put me in a bad mood.
I'm gonna be an acrobat when I grow up.
It'll bleed.
No.
A girl can never wear enough eye shadow.
What?
It's my mother.
What?
What do you want? My mom will skin me alive if she finds I'm out here.
What?
So?
For their meat.
Bye Mrs. Sennett.
No.
Well if you don't get to marry Mr. Bixler.
Something like that.
Well, I'm close to her.  I wanted to meet the one that got away.
I'm just glad someone finally put this thing in its proper perspective.
He says, "Swear.  When we're both 28, if we've never been married... we marry each other!"
Desperate.  To talk.
We're about to find out.
I can see why.
You've been working on this, huh?
That was Thursday.
I can't even say it.
To belong to someone.
Hey, handsome.  Brevity this...
Uh.  How about promoting a bridesmaid?  Someone you know for at least forty-five minutes.
... you hate weddings, you never go.
So your honeymoon is exactly where?
Do you get nervous in small confined spaces?
Well, perfection can get wearing after whi...
Ju...
Exactly.
I just don't want to freak him out.
They'll eat it anyway, you ever been to a walk?
I love him.
That's entirely understandable.
I guess getting him whacked would be politically out of the question.
I think you're making a mistake, sir.
I hope so.  This is all too mysterious to waste on just me.
I need to make some calls. Could I use... your office?
You don't understand.  I've never felt this way about anybody!
... Thomas, yeh.
Endearingly absent-minded.
First girl I ever knew.  Who lets me give her a bath.
What, leaving school...
You need a baby-sitter.  That's what I'm here for.
Michael!!
Like I said, dazzling.
You keep saying that.
Well, you've got the rest of your lives.
If you like.
ISN'T THERE A GUARD?  A JANITOR? A FUCKING CLEANING WOMAN? I'LL TAKE A BURGLAR!  SOMEBODY'S GOTTA BE IN TH...
Tomorrow is Sunday.  Nobody's doing business.  Crack of dawn, Monday, Walter'll take you up there...
... maybe it's congratulations.
The job thing would have broken us up, eventually, anyway.  She couldn't have lived with it.  I know that now.
She hasn't told anybody, what am I supposed to do?
And your point?
She admits it's her fault.
Oh, yeah.
Course, if it's later rather than sooner, I'd hate to be you at six o'clock.  You've got a lot of explaining to...
That's little egotistical.
No, it's, uh... a real big favor.
... and public relations is a big problem area for him.
... and you knew about this.
Well, forgive me for screwing up your plans!
What is that sup...
Well, if that's the way you f...
... Mr. Julianne Potter, prominent New York drag queen.
With those big, dark, haunted eyes. As if you were harborin' some... unspeakably... guilty... secret.
Right here.
I won first prize.
What's wrong honey.
What?
Honey, it's okay... How do you feel now?
How did you come in here?
Green.
Not a thing, Barnett, really. I need a little information. But, ah, it can wait.
Okay. Thanks.
He knows better.
A little slow, but she'll be fine.
Yes. She's pretty rested up.
Oh, no, listen, I don't want to take up too much of your time.
President.
Minimum.
D.C.
Okay.
When is it?
The Hell he did. Look, I'll see you in the morning.
Not yet.
Your brother?
How in the world did he get shot?
Sure he will.
Hi, Sherry.
No. Mr. Green, I don't know how to tell you this -- your wire passed away -- I thought they'd called you at home.
Can I help you?
Oh... a little of both. Just thought I'd look around at Nashville for a while.
Suits me.
What did you say?
No.
No.
No. Probably stay at a motel tonight.
No.
Do you carry door handles?
I've been so worried, dear. where are you?
How are you going to pay when you get sick?
But, I'll take some of that Nyquil... you know it puts you right to sleep no matter what's wrong, you go right off...
Bye.
About three years.
Linnea?
I'm here.
Tom. You remember?
What do you mean?  You said you wanted to see me.
Wow!
End of Church Street. Next to a grocery store.
I have to go.
I have to go. He sighs.
Well...
That's unkind.
That's what you said before.
What?
Yea.
Linnea?
How much?
Don't you worry about Sueleen Gay.
Might be good for you.
You're not.
Out.
Pretty good. Sure was surprised to hear from you. You talk to Bill?
Do they have a show to give it to you?
Did it break?
We're connected by a relative. One time, one of his aunts married one of my uncles. That was a long time ago, though. How'd you come to work for him?
I'll be dammed.
You bet.
Well, you just remember, if you can't kick front, kick back, 'cause at least you're kicking... Ten minutes, okay?
I'm John Triplette. Excuse me. I got all caught up in looking at you. You'll be fine.
May I see your costume?
I see.
More or less...
That's what Tim said.
Yes, they were.
What...
Apple, pecan, cherry, and key lime.
How do you intend to disappear? you're probably the most famous couple in America.
What he said. We didn't know jack shit about and riot. It just happened. It was kismet. We didn't even know those people. How are we supposed to organize a riot when we've been in fuckin' isolation for the past year? Just bleep out the fucks and jack shits.  I mean, it's not like we care. If they wanna say we masterminded the whole thing, let 'em. It won't exactly keep us up at night. But you said you wanted the truth, and the truth is we were just lucky.
You been followin' the news coverage?
Susanville, Soledade.
Mickey's better half herself. Mallory Knox. This little lady drowned her father in a fish tank.
Ain't love grand.
How's it goin'?
I've never wounded anything in my life. I got you locked right between the eyes.
There's a chocolate cream filled in there?
Not good.
Did you ever do one on Wayne Gacy?
Whose ratings were higher?
Have you talked to Mallory about this?
Let's do it.
Probably not, but we're gonna give it the old college try.
Got it.
So, what now?
Just save your breath, Wayne. We hate you. If anybody in the fuckin' world deserves to die, it's you.
NO!!!
I don't give a damn if a million United States marines, all whistling the halls of Montezuma, are gonna come marchin' down this alley any second. There ain't not fuckin' way in hell I'm leaving you. And that's that!
You made every day like kindergarten.
Then you've seen the scene where Arnold Schwartzenegger is talking to Lou Ferigno.
They've hypnotized the nation.
Just for fun, I guess.
Mickey stops sawin' on my leg and says, 'Oh my God, I'm your biggest fan!'
It's hard to say Capt'n.
Rockin'!
Yeah, sure.
Perfecto!
How so?
But you'll never be whole again.
That sounds great. Look, I don't want any of this to intimidate you. This is not going to be a big deal. This is going to be very easy.  I need to talk with Mr. Wurlitzer. You guys get your equipment ready, power up the van and confirm a transmission code for the remote. Julie come with me.
Oh yes, indeed. Top flight.
Is that her real name?
Really?
They got a asshole over here.  A asshole sitting down reading a magazine over there.  A asshole perched up there.  Assholes everywhere. Hey, maybe if we were doin' that kiss, kiss, bang, bang stuff we'd need all those assholes, too. What we're about is intimacy. We're about two people having a conversation. Say I was interviewing you. All I want you to worry about is what I ask you. I want a trust to develop. If you're thinking about all this...  ...you're not going to relax, a trust won't develop, we'll be talking a each other instead of to each other, there will be no chance for intimacy.
Don't recite the fact to me. I'm sure I know 'em better than you do.
What are we talking about?
I'll cut it in half. Four guys, but that's it.
Man, the darkest thing they got in there is Coca-Cola.
Everybody givin' it away free, huh?
You think so, Frankie?
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
I still don't know what you're talkin' about.
No. You got the wrong idea.
Where was that?
'That right? I thought he was up North.
Thanks.
Guess I don't.
Where was your father born?
Well, he worked around.
That ain't my idea of friendliness.
Oh yeah?
Why don't you come over for a beer when you get through?
You must be new in town.
Yeah. On the section gang.
No.
You keep asking me why I'm here.
I like a place with lots of life.
That's fine with me. Keeps me out of trouble.
Well, my mother was the only good teacher the colored school ever had. Nobody bothers with those kids.
It's better than it used to be. Eight years ago they still had a lynching here. They tied a man to a car and dragged him to death. My father knew who did it, but he didn't say anything.
You almost got into trouble back there.
All right, so I'm primitive. So what d'you want with me?
Look, Duff - if you're free, I'm not working tomorrow.
I didn't know you had one.
Okay, I guess.
Just what I said. Don't look so scared.
It'll be fine when we get done with it.
Don't call them that.
Yeah, that's so.
Come here, baby.
Okay. Come on. Put 'em up!
Yeah.
We can always do that, Duff.
'You kiddin'? You ain't goin' to no white home. I seen the way they look at you when you go down the street.
Well, that don't do me one bit of good!
You'll be better off without me. I ain't fit to live with no more. It's just like a lynchin'. Maybe they don't use a knife on you, but they got other ways.
How 'bout the key?
Let's go, Jocko. The man's got homework.
Like what?
Yeah. That's right, Jocko.  Those white guys sure shoot up at you like a yeast cake if you just cock an eye at them.
Okay.
Workin' a saw mill.  Here's to.
Plannin' on getting married?
She don't look no worse to me.
He's been hitting it pretty hard. Got high blood pressure, too. I guess it's hard on him, having you around.
No thanks, Lee.
I guess I'll make me some trouble in that town.
I can always chop cotton if I have to.  If you want a ride, I'll take you home.
Okay.
Hell, I'm just like him.
Guess it's never been easy.
I guess I ain't.
I doubt it.
Well, that figures.  Kind of fits in with everything else, don't it!
Don't look like there's a right way.
Man, why 'you messin' around with a gal like that? You won't get no place.
How you doin'?  Hi there!
What's the matter?! You mad at me?
If you don't quit it, Will, I'm leaving.
That's not the play.  Omar'll get a shot off.  I can still talk to him, Nate, I just need time.
Bathroom. But he's nowhere near it.
I'm fine.
Of course.
My man's coming to get my ass out of here. That's good enough for me.
She was prettier before she tarted herself up with the hardware.
A place to tap in. I can scramble that signal before this place is crawling with guardsmen.
Why not?
You've got an expensive razor girl on me for a reason. I'd like to hear what it is.
I'd say you were full of shit.
First, let's get something straight. We ran a psych construct on you that lists self destruction as your favourite pastime. If you want to kill yourself, Mr. Case, there's much more entertaining ways than working for me.
The disturbance in cyberspace... It's an A.I.
Dixie McCoy
What's he doing to my gear?
Offworld. The A.I.... this "Wintermute" thing evolved on a computer mainframe on the satellite Freeside. If you attack it from within the matrix while Molly accesses its original programming we can cripple its defence systems.
You see the couple up in the balcony?
He's a Sense/Net Chairman. Why would he launch an A.I.?
We won't have to. The run is tomorrow night.
This ain't Bangkok, chief.
Can you read my mind?
The words?
Patience, Mr. Case. Only one hour and thirty-eight minutes to enlightenment.
That's a good question. What's the last thing you remember?
Dixie, you know how a ROM construct works?
I an' I, man. I an' I.
Can you walk?
Jah guides us.
Right...
You're Dixie McCoy's construct. That makes you something special.
Nobody has.
When we're done, erase this friggin' tape.
That's pretty good cause he's only working with one lobe.
We run. You crack the pattern?
I'll let it access me. That'll give you a free shot. Make it a good one. Dix.
Not good enough, man. They planted something inside me. I'm on my own countdown.
Case.
I thought you already left.
You set me up from the beginning. It was you that got Julius killed.
I'm gonna burn you to the ground, you son of a bitch.
Shut down your ice patterns. I'll take you out.
Why should I want to meet him.
We'll find out soon enough. If you don't pull the splices out.
You're not ready yet. They said two days.
What is it with you? Why is it so important? It's a buzz, right? Like getting high.
A regular Fagan.
Put the gun down, Case.
I don't sleep much. You packed?
Give me five minutes.
Not when Sense/Net throws the going away party. They'll be on our asses from now on.
Something exotic I hope.
That's risky gear. It can drive you schizo.
What went down between you and Riviera?
No. It's important to be able to feel those things.  We're going to pull this run off, Molly, and we've got to do it soon.
Hold on.
Surviving, darling. It's my specialty. Only this time I'm doing it my style. I've beaten him, you know.
Everybody's favourite computer, of course. He may have out calculated the rest of you, but I have certain qualities that don't translate well on microchips.
What are you talking about?
Well, do you?
Yeah. Let's do that.
That's the old drive-in. They call it "The Court". Now it's just a continuous party for Guy's group.
Yeah, I know.
Well I'm so glad that you guys are.
Nope.
OH! How about "Under the Sea?"
Jos, that's not what we're --
Anita, remember espadrilles?
What'd you feel when you kissed him?
'Nita, this is about reporting, not accessorizing.
Sometimes opposites attract.
That you would trip on your Barbie heels and I'd get named prom queen?  Did I say that out loud?
Yeah it's French. There's no accent aigue, so the e is soft.
Why?
Betty.
Five-- Six--
Every Tom, Dick, and Harry thinks he can write. But a journalist gets in there, right where the bombs are. He's aggressive. Grabs the bull by the balls.
Geller...you wanna be a reporter? Take a look at what sells! Sex scandals. Bribery. People jumping off buildings. So unless a kid just killed himself because he was being paid to have sex with the school mascot in a big vat of this cole slaw, you got nothing!
Have you been to any parties?
They hid my car--
No, it's the Great and Powerful Oz. Now listen--you're in over your head. This is how it's gonna work. I review the tapes, I find your story.
I bet Good Housekeeping would go gaga over the cole slaw piece.
There is no lid! Nothing's going on between Sam and me. Coulson. Mr. Sam Coulson and me.
No it's not. Guys name their penises.
Oh yay! And then I could be as happy as you!
Do you remember high school?
Don't you remember what they called you?
Is that true?
I know.
I-
You like her?
True. I guess she hadn't completely given up hope.  Are you sure you're seventeen?
Thank you.
College. Haven't really thought about it.
You remember that story?
You do. Seem to. Have passion. In the classroom.
I know.
But Humpty Dumpty was alone.
That's really what we all need, right? Someone to sit up on the wall with us--
To put us back together again when we fall.
Do you think you'll find her?
Oh--yikes!
Wow. You believe in me that much--
Yeah, I have.
No, surprise, I thought you'd be--
You were attracted to me?
I finally found my story.
It's really hard to do. Some kids try for all of-high school and never make it.
You so do not deserve to be prom queen.
I'm handing out a free lei to every customer! What do you think?
Yeah. Definitely.
<i>                      I'm not the dumb one...</i>
We went through the door...
Nothing.  W-w-what are you talking about?
Whatever it is, it's none of your concern.
Can't you make other creations?
Dad's fixin' something again.  Hit the deck!
Who's Lisa?
He's dead, you bitch.
He can't hold you Jesse.  He's losing his grip - you can get out.
You got a problem with me, Grady?
Not too far.  My folks bought a place over on Elm Street.
You gotta let me stay here tonight, Grady.
Look, I don't care if you believe me or not...
Only it was more like, you know, sleep- walking.  All I know is I woke up on the cellar floor next to it.
Who?
Yeah, I know...synapses neurong...
I don't know - into the air I suppose.
What's this?
I don't know - a sharp pain.
Why won't you talk to me?
What are you gonna do?  How are you gonna help?  I'm losing my mind.  I don't want to have you watch me fall apart.
I can't!
We must look like a couple of escapees from a veterans' hospital.
I know it's warm...  I wish you'd call someone to check out the air conditioning, Ken.
Look, Miss Thompson, I don't know what you want from me.
That's right.  I don't.
Mom?
Research.
Wait and see.
I don't know.  I'm busy with school. New friends.  But I'll never forget the old ones.
Do you still...see each other?
When I was a little girl.  Three or four. If I had a nightmare, I'd bring my Dad in. The dream would always get better.  He always used to tell me about it the next day -- he used to think they were his dreams. NANCY When did it stop?
You never lose a gift like that.  You just forget how to use it.  How about it?  Will you try?
He's heavy in the halls...
They sedated me.  We're stuck here till it wears off.
I think so.
What?
She's been waiting outside your office since breakfast.
Say listen, Doc.  I got a new theory about all these suicides.
It's been a long time.
Nancy...
Most authentic Mexican food in Springwood, which isn't saying much.  your parents still live around here?
Sounds like a rough time.
Okay...I believe in different levels of conciousness, that sort of thing...but if you're into UFO's or Atlantis, you've lost me.
With Hypnocyl?
So do I.
I'm sorry, Nancy.  The answer is no.
Breathe deeply and relax...starting with your toes, relax everything until there's no tension left in your bodies.  None at all.  Keep following the pendulum...
This isn't possible.  And even if it is...what the hell am I doing here?  Did you drag me in here too?
There's only one man...and its time for him to talk.
And what are they?
What are you talking about?
Mary Helena.
Purgatory...fashioned by the hands of men.  Twisted, lost souls, the worst of the criminally insane, were locked away in here like animals.
That girl was Amanda Krueger.  Her child --
The bastard son of a hundred maniacs. Some say he was murdered, though no body was ever found.
Elizabeth, we don't need any outside help.  I know these kids.  I don't want some hot-shot taking chances with them just so she can get published.
I won't allow it.
For God's sake, Elizabeth...just try to help the kids, will you?  Listen to them.
I'm not listening.
Who was that rather difficult chap you were talking to on the way up?
Really?
Thanks.  I'll think about it.
Eighteen yards.  That's my house there.
I forgot my bag.
Right.  No one.  I mean, I'll tell myself sometimes but... don't worry -- I won't believe it.
You played it pretty cool here, waiting for three days to call.
No, it's a stupid privacy thing.  I always choose a cartoon character -- last time out, I was Mrs. Bambi.
Ahm -- well -- we would have liked to -- but it was difficult, obviously, being set in space.
Thank you.  You are 'Horse and Hound's' favorite actress.  You and Black Beauty.  Tied.
That's fine.
You said 'whoopsidaisies.'
Come in.
Oh no no -- no.
Hand it over.  Basic plot?
'No, turn over 4 TRS's and tell them we need radar feedback before the KFT's return at 19 hundred -- then inform the Pentagon that we'll be needing black star cover from ten hundred through 12.15' -- and don't you dare say one word about how many mistakes I made in that speech or I'll pelt you with olives.
Yes -- happiness wouldn't be happiness without a violin-playing goat.
Yes.  Always have had.
No.  What's that?
Okay.
What is it about men and nudity? Particularly breasts -- how can you be so interested in them?
You're lovelier this morning than you have ever been.
Undressed like this, yes.
That's not true.  And wait a minute... this is crazy behavior.  Can't we just laugh about this?  Seriously -- in the huge sweep of things, this stuff doesn't matter.
Well, you know -- it's just one day. Today's papers will all have been thrown away tomorrow.
Hello.
You expect me to tell the truth about my life to the most indiscreet man in England?
That's fine.  There's always a pause when the jury goes out to consider its verdict.
I see.  That reality is a real 'no,' isn't it?
Okay.  Fine.  Fine.  Good decision.
Tempting but... no, thank you.
Is that right?
I can't say I know Patrick all that well.
He wouldn't say.
In a depressingly asexual way.
Well, obviously it's me, isn't it -- I work in the City in a job I don't understand and everyone keeps getting promoted above me.  I haven't had a girlfriends since... puberty and, well, the long and short of it is, nobody fancies me, and if these cheeks get any chubbier, they never will.
Yes -- sort of...
Shame!
Hun -- this is Anna.  Anna -- this is Honey -- she's my baby sitter.
The others?
Shall I go get a cappuccino?  Ease the pain.
Right.  It's not a classic anecdotes, is it?
Martin, can't you just deal with this yourself?
Can you tell her I'll ring her back.
No -- did you?
But I wish to make it clear I've turned a corner and henceforward intend to be impressively happy.
No, don't think I do.
Great.  Excellent.  Thanks.
How about Miss Flintstone?
Right.  Right.  Fair enough.  Thanks.
Yes -- I was looking for Anna Scott...
Hi...
Ahm let's see -- ahm.  No.  Gone completely.  Oh no, wait.  There was -- one from your mum: she said don't forget lunch and her leg's hurting again.
No -- you're right.
Well, there are.  And we don't need to go anywhere near that far.  My best friend slipped -- she slipped down- stairs, cracked her back and she's in a wheelchair for the rest of her life. All I'm asking for is a normal amount of perspective.
Oh sure.  Of course.
What?
I haven't got a book down my trousers.
Yes, that is correct.
I mean, the other day you made an allusion to my wife and the possible sexual problems we might be having. I know that to be the case, but the way in which you broached it, if that's your idea of teaching me something...
Y-y-y-yes...
Mister Washington.
Will you come with me, please.
Thank you, ma'am...
Mister McMurphy, there are old men here who couldn't hear the music at all if it were lower. That music is all they have, and I wish you wouldn't lean against the glass there, your hands are staining the window.
What for?
No way.
Yeah, yeah, the hell with that crap! The World Series is goin' on right' now an' that's therapy also!
What the hell does that have to do with it? This is an important event and I want a vote on it!
A vote is before the group.
He's into his wind-up. Here's the next pitch... and it's a hit! It's a hit!
No, it was irresponsible!
Yes, ma'am?
Ma'am, I'm as gentle as a puppy dog. Why, I haven't licked the tar out of an aide for two weeks! Hi ya, Doc!
O-o-o-oh...
'K-k-kay, Mack!
Y-y-yes, a b-b-bus!
C-C-Come here and l-look at th this!
Just fine, Billy boy, just fine. Full of piss an' vinegar! They checked my plugs and cleaned my points...
Good boy, thank you, Billy.
Wu-wu-wu I-I-I-I th-th-think sh-sh sh-she's th-th-th-the ma-ma-ma-most bu-bu-bu-beautiful wu-wu-wu-woman in th-th-the whole world!
Ca-na-da...
Yeah...
Are they all crazies?
Wow! They're so quiet.
Come here a minute, Cheswick. You, too, Sefelt. Hey, all you guys, come over here, I wanna show you somethin'.
Tell 'er to go straight to hell!
Me, too...
A pecking party?
Did to you and all the rest of you guys.
What for?
Lobotomy?
She's not all that homely, Mister McMurphy. In fact, she must have been a rather beautiful young lady.
You mean you're going to try to pick that thing up and shove it through the window?
I'm not talkin' to him! I'm talkin' to myself! It helps me think!
What for?
I refuse!
Me too! Me too!
What is it?
He's not!
In what way?
Well, according to the Warden at Pendleton, you were a disturbing influence on others. 'It appears that there is a potential in him for instigating a revolt among the other inmates.'  What do you think of that report?
The doctor at the prison states: 'Don't overlook the possibility that this man may be faking psychosis to escape the drudgery of the work farm...' What do you say to that?
Come on, Doc, you know as well as I do what's been comin' down in that loony bin.
I'm afraid not.
I'm sorry, but I can't keep you here.
We'll let you know.
Time out!
'Kay, Mac!
You're on!
I'm not going back in there. I told ya this was a one way trip. Now stand aside.
He can't hear you. He's just a deaf and dumb Indian!
Gimme those dice. I'll blow this board to pieces. Here we go...  Lebenty leben, count me over eleven, Martini...
I don't have any.
Shit, man, tha' ain't even worth considerin'.
Take you han's offa me!
Yes, Miss Ratched!
Cleanliness is a twenty-four-hour job, ma'am...
Ah, no, ma'am... well, yes, ma'am...  A man get awful lonely at night, if ya know what Ah mean, ma'am...
Yes, ma'am...
That!
You ol' fucker!
Oh, yeah...
Mr. Bradley left about a half hour ago.  He said his plans had changed unexpectedly.  Would you prefer an interior or exterior room?
No.
Oh no.  Do you?
Dwayne?
Ask her if she knows where he is?
But Faith--
Hi there...
No, you gave a very convincing performance.  And you'll be pleased to know that your eight-by-ten glossy is now on display at the local playhouse.
Hm.
My name's 
Right.  Thanks a lot.  And congratulations.  It's not easy finding love these days.
You said whatever it was you would understand.
If it's any of your business, yes.
Does he love you?
So it wasn't real.
You found him.  I don't know how to thank you.
Oh.  That's nice.
Well, good.  Good for you.
Just to that place down at the bottom of the stairs.  Nothing fancy.
You too.
What are you doing here?
Actually, I think I prefer Katherine Hepburn.
You're the reason I never met him. You knew it was the thing I most wanted in life and you sabotaged it.
I would call it-- unforgivable.
Gee, I'm flattered.  What an incredibly romantic gesture. Cancel the roses, I've decided to lie to her instead.
Tonight?
Okay.  Good.  See you then, then.
Brunello di Montalcino, '85, please.
And more...
Hmmmm... Well, the scampi sounds good...
Uh, the scampi sounds good to me, too.
Oh, hello.
What?
Don't tell me, Oprah did a show--
No, Faith.  They came out of somebody's imagination.
So?...
Yes you did.
Oh, I don't know.  I guess it's just not quite the way I always thought it was going to be.  You know, like in the movies.
I know.  You're right.
I think he's having an affair.
No...  I can just tell.
Maybe.
What?
We're not looking to arrest the man, Faith, we're trying to locate him.
Nothing.
I don't know, Kate.  I just said that.  I'm sorry.  I'm just on edge.  I'm afraid we're losing him.
'Course he does.
Larry bought himself cologne?
Because I'm the one who's single.
Oh my God.  Where?
Faith.  So far you've trailed the man halfway around the globe.  At this point, I don't think another fifteen feet is gonna tip the scales.
Okay, here's what I think.  We find out what all the subway stops for that train are-- the subway system's really not that big in Rome, we could narrow it down and--
Hi.  Where've you been?
Packing.
Because I've been kidding myself. Because I realized you were right from the beginning.  This whole thing was just a wild goose chase.
I know, but...
He's down in someplace called Positano.  Peter says we can make it there by morning.
Is Damon Bradley here?
My God... you're right.
Uh huh.
Went to high school with him. But...
I can't tell her.  She's called off her wedding.  She'll never speak to me again.
He missed me.
She's not here.
Thanks.
Talk louder. I can't hear you.
I know what's eatin' you, kid. But I got two thousand dues-payin' members in my local— that's seventy-two thousand a year legitimate and when each one of 'em puts in a couple of bucks a day to make sure they work steady— well, you figure it out. And that's just for openers. We got the fattest piers in the fattest harbor in the world. Everything that moves in and out— we take our cut.
In a minute.
Why me, Charley? I'd feel funny going in there.
Thicker than water.
Sure, that's all right when you're a kid, but you'll be pushing thirty pretty soon, slugger. It's time you got some ambition.
Maybe.
I could have been better!
What do you weigh these days, slugger?
Hello, Edie.
Terry... Terry... .
Which side are you with?
You training to be a nun or something?
Yeah. Yeah. I get your thought. You know I seen you lots of times before. Parochial school on Pulaski Street? Seven, eight years ago? Your hair come down in—
Looked like two pieces of rope. And your teeth were—
I only live up there and across the roof.
That was nice of you.
If you don't  Keep your neck in and your nose clean and You'll never have no trouble down here.
All right, all right.. I shouldn't 've asked you.
What I did to Joey.
How can you be with Charley and Johnny Friendly and still be with me? Either way it's a lie. It's like there were two different people inside of you. You've got to be one or the other.
I don't want you to do anything. Let your conscience tell you what to do.
I thought you might want some hot coffee.
Who is he, Pop?
He tries to act tough, but there's a look in his eyes that... .
And learn about charity and justice and all the other things people would rather talk about than practice? Pop goes up to her and holds out his two arms, his right one closer to Edie; he trembles with emotion.
Mind your own business, Father.
A bum. Look what you're doing. You want to be brave? Firing lead into another man's flesh isn't brave. Any bum who picks up a .45 in a pawn shop can be that brave. You want to hurt Johnny Friendly? You want to fix him for what he did to Charley— and a dozen men who were better than Charley? Don't fight him like a hoodlum down here in the jungle. That's just what he wants. He'll hit you in the head and plead self-defense. Fight him tomorrow in the courtroom— with the truth as you know it—  Truth is the gun— Drop that thing and tell the truth— a more dangerous weapon than this little —  —cap pistol.
Well, I had my fun, I've drunk my fill and I tickled some good-lookin' fillies— I'm on borried time.
O.K. O.K. Without the bird seed. What do you want?
Take it easy.
I told you I don't know nothin' and I ain't saying nothin'.
Be sure they got enough water.
Looking for me?
So-so, Johnny.
Aw, you know I don't like to count, Johnny.
By way of Chicago?
Listen, Johnny—
You ratted on us, Terry.
Okay.
It frightens me.
What help can we possibly find in the cemetery at this time of night?
I'm not sure...
I'm not sure, myself. It's just a feeling I've had since the crash...Like I feel a cold chill all over.. ..Now this!
You've got a right to be. We're trapped by a bunch of fiends.
My old boyfriend Tommy would never have gotten me in a mess like this.  At least <i>he's</i> got brains.
A symbol, Master.
El Dia De Los Muertos...A celebration in her country.
At the first sight of the morning sun's rays, we must be gone.
It would seem so, Master
There is yet time.  Don't you want your own pleasure?
Hahh, there is always time... All in good time...there is <b>always</b> time.  You shall have your pleasure.  <b>THAT</b>... I <i>decree</i>
Is there time?
I'm so frightened.
Aannnnaahhnn.
So why don't you come right out and tell me what you're talking about?
Yeah, that's him.  Buddy says Glenn thinks you guys are real cool.
You do the sawing of the box in half trick with you inside?
You mean, did he try to jump me?  No, but he was kind of talkative.
He did?  I don't remember.  Did he say about me?  In the trunk?
Yes.
Listen to me.  I'm a good friend of Jack Foley.
Listen, I'm the one help Jack escape from prison.  He tole me, I can't find him to see you.  So why don't you open this fucking door.  Okay?  So we can speak.
The Wall Street guy?  Oh, yeah.  I didn't recognize him without his rug.
How 'bout the score was his idea to begin with?
You're right.
There's some lilac oil, you want some, a vanilla candle under the sink.
We'll leave first thing in the morning.
Shit.
In here with my suntan lotion and beach towel.  That's her place.
Uh-huh...
Sure looks that way.
I think Glenn opened his big mouth and now we got us another partner.
Doesn't say what she's doing up here, but I don't think it has anything to do with us.
Two hours.
Time comes, we knock on the door.  See if he wants to talk about old times. Go in the easy way.
Yeah, it's called Glades Correctional Institution and I'm sure as shit not going back there or any place like it.
They put a gun on you, you still have a choice, don't you?
Yeah, and I better call my sister.
You know how I felt about her.
It wasn't about getting laid.  I just wanted to know what might've happened if things were different.
Yeah, I did.
I don't know.
Whatta you wanna do?
And then they'll kill 'em.
In the trunk, yeah?
Is that what you would've done?
Karen.  Where are you?  I been trying to get a hold of you.
There was a Buddy Bragg at Lompoc around the same time Foley was there.  We got an address for him at the Adams Hotel in Hallandale.  I want you to go there, see if you can get the manager to i.d. him as the other guy.  If he does, you call me right away...
Now.  What is it you wanted to tell me?
You wouldn't shoot me, would you?
I told you, man, Super Bowl Sunday.
Why you think is today?
Dude in the dress is Eddie Solomon, used to buy scag off a corner till he kicked it and found his happiness with crack and then started dealing himself. Word on the street was he was saving up for an operation.
Yeah, Eddie was a real character.  Had these girls cooked the rocks he called the Rockettes.
Company, shit.  I watch the man's back.
Another C.
Thirty-two outta what, twenty?
Warm?  Man, it's ninety-five degrees in here, sometimes a hundred -- the way Emanuel always kep' it so his boys'd sweat, get lean and mean like Tommy Hearns.  No, I ain't talking any business in here.  To me this is holy ground, man.  You understand?  I got to be someplace anyway.  Y'all want to talk, come to the fights tomorrow night, we'll sit down and look at it good. The State Theater.
Your homie, Glenn.  Only thing, he went to the men's about a while ago and never came back.
Snoop, if you don't know where Glenn is...
I wasn't asking permission.
Break and enter, shit.  Take it and git, how it's done.  Don't waste any time.  That's how you do it.
You're right.  So why take a chance--
For your breath.  You could use it. Squirt some in your mouth.
In my bag, in the car.
You wouldn't have time anyway.  We come to a roadblock, they'll run the car, find out in five seconds who it belongs to.
I thought so, too.
Sure.
Yes.
He's dead.  He did twenty-seven years before he came out and died not too long after in Charity Hospital, I think trying to make up for all the good times he'd missed.  That's not gonna be me.
I'm partial to mountains myself.  But if you like islands, we'll make it an island.
I don't have a problem with it.
No.  What do you do for a living, Gary?
I don't think it works if we're somebody else.  You know what I mean?  Gary and Celeste, Jesus, what do they know about anything?
It doesn't have to, it's something that happens.  It's like seeing a person you never saw before -- you could be passing on the street -- you look at each other and for a few seconds, there's a kind of recognition.  Like you both know something.  But then the next moment the person's gone, and it's too late to do anything about it, but you remember it because it was right there and you let it go, and you think, "What if I had stopped and said something?"  It might happen only a few times in your life.
Well, I'd say who I was and do you remember me and ask if you'd like to meet for a drink.
That's not what you were about to say.
Yeah, but in a nice way.
I don't think we should get into that.
Pretend I'm somebody else.
I guess the bright glare out here made it hard to see the numbers on the weights.
Ever seen an uncut diamond, Studs? They look like plain old rocks.
You know who they are?
Any time.
I don't know.  I never used a gun.
Doesn't have to figure out shit.  You <u>told</u> him you keep 'em at your house.
No need to decide now.  Be like the fish.  Let whatever happens happen.
Yeah, fish live in the present.  They don't dwell on yesterday and they don't worry about tomorrow.  Even when a big fish attacks a little fish, there's no neurosis involved.  No guilt afterward. No whining on some fish-shrink's couch. They just do it.  They accept.
The fish saved my life.  Two years ago, I found out I had high blood pressure.  So my doctor, he tells me to go get an aquarium, look at the fish every time I felt myself stressing out.
Ten, you count the prison hospital in Ohio I walked away from.
Hejira.
Jesus, what'd you crawl through, a sewer?
Listen, these guys, they're gonna be out here any minute looking for me. They're fucking animals.
Nothing.  I just wanna get the fuck outta here.
Rippin' off Ripley was my idea, but these guys, man, they're into shit I can't handle.
Maurice is gonna kill him, try and collect the reward.
Some<u>one</u>?  Gimme a hint.
Oh, I'm here, all right.  I'm very here. Question is, why aren't <u>you</u> here?
Me?
You not with probation, one of those?
What did you call it?
Something better.  Open it.
Which one is that?  The ATF guy?
I'd like that.
No?
Likewise.
Whoever.  The point is, prices are goin' up, too.  Better get your little black book out, Richard.  We got some business to talk about.
Yeah.  Sure.  It's all settled.
Are those <i>my</i> suits?
Jack Foley, famous bank robber.
I sent these two looking for him, they come back shaking their heads.
That's your line for tonight, ya know.
If Evelyn's here, the rest are here!
Only when I'm n-n-n-
Yes Sir.
You guys get those!  Earl, Rafe, come with me!
I was grieving too.
So what are you saying?
How sweet.  Is that when you put the move on her?
What's between you and her is between you and her.  But here's what's between you and me.  Everybody has a hero, Danny. And you're mine.
Longer?  It's getting shorter.
The brass is afraid of sabotage.  This makes 'em easier to protect -- and easier to service.
Were.  Isn't that what you mean?  Were. Because he's dead, isn't he?  And that's why you've come.
He told me he didn't want to leave me with regret.  Now that's all I have.
Well...sure.
The navy will get us to within 400 miles of the Japanese coast.  We'll launch off the carriers from there.
I have a phrase I want you all to memorize:  "Lushu hoo megwa fugi."  It means "I am an American."  In Chinese.
Never, Sir.  I just meant it's dangerous only for the kind of pilot who wants to show off, rather than inspire the other pilots in his unit.  And all you've done for me, Sir, working out the transfer, I did it to say thanks.  To honor you, Sir. What the French call a "homage."
Top secret means you help me pick the other pilots, train, and go -- without knowing where you're going until it's too late.
Our doctor's gone too.
Respect.
Tell me something, Dorie.  A man as big as you -- and smart too, you knew where to come when your ship couldn't help -- do you still have to fight with your fists to get respect?
You waited til tonight to tell me?
It's not that I didn't mean everything I wrote.  It's just that -- I thought you were dead.  And now --
If we achieve surprise, they will offer little resistance.
Peggy Sue!
It's her 18th birthday, I want to show her off.
That never changes.  You know, when you and Grandma are gone, the family's gone. I never see the cousins anymore.
Borrow?! This was my dress.  Maybe it's a mistake. What if I'm the only one? I don't even want to go. Everybody's just going to say...  Hi.. Where's Crazy Charlie?
Oh, it's not so bad. I have two wonderful kids, my own business.  Still, knowing what I know now, if I had the chance to do it all over again, I'd sure do things a lot differently.
I can't. It's all too much.
Yes. Let's stay in touch.
Why do guys do such stupid things?
I mailed it to you on Wednesday.
I'm not going.
I call this the staccato. 
Why wait?
They'll learn to live with it.
I thought it had a lot of merit.
Save it.
Nothing.. Selling is selling.
I have to talk to you..
Let's go down to the basement.
It means I care about you and what happens to you.
Okay. Listen, I cancelled the tickets for Fabian. I thought it would be better for your birthday to eat at a nice restaurant, Chez Tres.
You're crazy! You're really out of your mind!
I'm trying.
Charlie? Was I dead?
You look awful, like you haven't slept in days. And so old.
Oh, God, Dion.
Charles, in spite of your adolescent infatuation with music, we've always regarded you a a fine young man. We've trusted you with our daughter.
He's very interesting. For all his pretending to be a tough guy, he's really got the soul of a poet.
Gilfond's okay, except he thinks Hemingway's great Literature.
Is that one of your poems?
I shouldn't have put you through that. It must have been agony. Let's do something.
Peggy Sue's still stuck on treble without a cause.
I think I'm way ahead of them.
Calm down. Just listen for a minute.. Please.
Good, you got your money out of that greedy bank.
It's hard to believe you're going to be eighteen.  Want an eskimo pie? Or a creamsicle? I'd come home from the store and there's little you running up to me. I'd give you a dime and you'd promise never to grow up.
I, that what all that nonsense was about this morning? You're worried about my business?
Didn't call, them pantyhose, though. What was it, Evelyn?
Look young lady, I grew up through the depression. I fought in the second World War. Six days a week I get up and deal with the public, the bank and the bill collectors. And on the seventh day, when God rests, I don't have to listen to my daughter calling me a fool!
Please don't shout.
I want everybody to hear because I don't have anything to be ashamed of.
Why don't you go lie down for a while.
Oh Mom, I forgot you were ever so young.
I'm still here, aren't I? I may as well enjoy myself. I'm going to go to school today.  Dad, I want to apologize for yesterday. The car is a classic. Use it in the best of health.
Oh.	Ah...recently. All the kids drink it.
I had a dream that Grandma died.
You know, you two are wonderful parents. I'm really going to try to behave myself.
Can I tell Diane that Peggy Sue got drunk or is that a deep family secret?  Well?
I was once. Richard!? Richard Norvik? I didn't recognize you.
Well, you showed them. You're rich and famous and successful. And you have a beautiful wife.
I'm not doing any tutoring this year. I'm too busy.
I'm writing a book on kite construction. What did you want to talk about?
Are you doing some kind of science project?
Well... in a Newtonian framework, the possibilities were limited, but with the advent of relativity theory, the idea of absolute time can no longer be reasonably affirmed.
I	know what a burrito is.
What's inside?
That's why I was getting a divorce..  What I really think is that I had a heart attack at the reunion and died.
Am I dead or not?
Confucious says, The way out is through the door. There's a truck. There's your door.
I'm trying. I'll see you tomorrow. 
I tried to tell them, but they wouldn't listen to me.
That's what you were talking about yesterday? Everybody does that in the future?
Cheer up. Now you can give some other guy a shot. Make it up to him later and buy him a yacht.
Peggy Sue Kelcher.  Or, Peggy Bodell.  I'm not sure.
It's all, gone wrong, nothing's working out.
--Drew, he's your dog. Are you listening to this?
Sure.
It sucked.
Anywhere but here.
Just until he heals up?
You never get over it.
All the time.
You know everything, don't you?
You'll have to get right on it, Andy, we're up against the statute of limitations.
I don't know what to do, Bob.
What's wrong with my face? You want to know what's wrong with my face? I've got a skin condition. Next question, Bob? No more questions? Fine. Now can you help me find the complaint?
What's that on your forehead, pal?
Andy?
Yeah. Thanks, guys.
You're not going to like this. Please try to smile...
I have too much work to do. Skip the treatment.
I said, skip it, Michael. It's my treatment.
No.
That's right. We're on the Positive Plan. You don't have a Fatal Disease, you have Manageable Illness.
Do you think I'm ready for it?! I hate this shit. I'm not a fucking martyr! I hate every goddamn part of it!
I hope you're ready for "Studs," because that's what's on.
No sweat, buddy.
A carrot?!
Dr. Klenstein.  It's not a pleasant procedure, but if the KS is causing the diarrhea, we ought to know right away.
Okay, okay... They discover you have this horrible, disgusting, terminal illness, and they panic, for any number of perfectly valid reasons. They're frightened for themselves, their families... Maybe it's the homo angle. Maybe they don't want to rub elbows with someone who's just popped out of the closet with a terminal case of acne. And how do they explain your status to the client for Chrissake?
What?
What's her name?
Any settlement agreement <u>must</u> include, and this is critical, a letter of exoneration, making clear my termination had nothing to do with the quality of my work.
Thank you.
Let me tell you something, okay? When you're brought up, like the rest of us, in a place like where I was brought up, there's not a whole lot of discussion about... homosexuals. As a kid, you're taught right away that queers are weird, queers are funny, they're a danger to kids, they're afraid to fight, and they all want to cop your joint. And that pretty much sums up the general thinking out there, if you want to know the truth.
Do you... pray?
What impressed you about him?
You don't bring your personal life into a law firm. You're not supposed to <u>have</u> a personal life, really. Anyway, I did plan to tell Charles, eventually. But then, this thing happened at the tennis club...
I'm an excellent lawyer.
It was good working with you, Andrew. You're welcome.  Hey. Shouldn't you put that thing back on?
I'm late, I have to pick up Amy from her afterschool but I want to talk to you about that Hansen thing.
Get down to Word Processing. Help Jamey look.
Not unnecessary ones.
Yes.
It's impossible to know exactly when or how I was infected with HIV.
No.
Isn't it true you have spent your life pretending to be something you're not, so much so that the art of concealment and dishonesty has become second nature to you?!
Really?
That's right.
Absolutely.
Answer the question, please.
Yes.
What did you say?
Thank you. No more questions.
Right.
I may have said something like that. But that's not how I feel at this moment.
I might.
In a word, yes.
Aren't you?
How many do you know?
My lettuce is wilting.
Why didn't you cross at the crosswalk?
Tell Iris all about it.  Take good care of Mrs. Finley, Iris.  Beckett, come in.
Yes, we did.
I'll take that under consideration, Your Honor.
By God you <u>will</u> settle it! If you force this case to trial, young man, you'll regret it for the rest of your natural-born days... Now, Joseph. What would you require to settle this matter today?
Helloooo...
Andy, you don't want this.
Jesus.
Bob. You're trying my patience. Andrew Beckett is making his private life our business. We gave him Kronos. Did he say, "I'm sick. I might not be able to see this through?"
Lookit. Lookit!
Four fulls, one half. That mean we're halfway there? I hope?
Show me your eyes.
Slam doctor. Well, we called him "doctor."
Entered our minds.
Had it with deals.
Hunger. I see 60 years of hunger.
<u>Listen</u>.
Get out of our way.
But they...they could still be....
Cargo hold, everyone in the cargo hold. lesgo, lesgo, lesgo.
I know what's in here!
Like the light is scalding it.
We'll have to carry the cells...drag them...whatever it takes.
Hey, who?
Only around humans.
What'd Owens mean? 'Bout not touching the switch?
Fuck. Guess I'm more glad to be here than I thought.
Ease up, ease up. JOHNS! Just tell me what....
<u>We're gonna find the body</u>, Johns. Christ, you're a cop. Why am I tellin' you this? We gotta go down and find it.
You said it, not me. Let's just not let one bad call lead to another.
Nothing we can't repair -- so long as the electrical adapts.
Let's wait on the power cells.
May've noticed chains don't work on this guy. Only way we're truly safe is if he believes he's goin' free. But if he <u>stops</u> believin' --
<u>You</u> made it a problem when you let Owens die like that. When you had enough drugs to knock out a fucking mule-team.
For your own fear.
What the hell's it matter?
79 kilos.
I don't get it, Johns. What is so goddamn valuable in your life that you're worried about losing? Huh? Is there anything at all? Besides your next hype?  Got no right to be so scared. Neither one of us.
Are you fucking high again? Just listen to --
You hear me? Captain's dead. Owens too.
For now.
Has anyone checked the coring room?
Which half?
Blessing you like the others.  It's painless.
I'm born-again.
Those suns gotta come back <u>sometime</u>. And if these animals really are phobic about light, we just sit tight till then.
Didn't say that. But least this way I don't have to worry about falling asleep and not wakin' up.
Say that again.
For what? The honor of goin' back to some asshole of a cell?
Not afraid of the dark, are you?
Kept calling it "murder" when I did it.
Oh, you're a piece of art, Johns. They oughtta hang you in a museum somewhere. Or forget the museum -- maybe they should just hang you.
Certainly, sir. I'll get my notes and come right over.
Did you forget our appointment, Cornelius?
It wasn't difficult. Only an apostate or a lunatic would flee to the Forbidden Zone.  I see you brought along the female of your species.  I didn't realize a man could be monogamous.
We've never meant to be treasonable, sir.  But up there, in the face of that Cliff, is a vast cave -- and in that cave a fabulous treasure of fossils and artifacts.
To begin with, your methods of dating the past are crude, to say the least. There are geologists on my staff who would laugh at your speculations.
Do you have any weapons?
Sorry, Taylor. The terrain around that lake is poisonous. There is no fresh water, no vegetation. Nothing.
Good luck then.
Remembers what?
Oh, Cornelius, be quiet.
No, they won't -
Because if he is a missing link, it means the Sacred Scrolls aren't worth their parchment.
Right.  Let's put the water and provisions in the wagon.
Yo!
Any sign of dangerous ionization?
You're more than three hundred light years from your precious planet. Your loved ones have been dead and forgotten for twenty centuries. Even if you could get back, they'd think you were something that fell out of a tree.
I don't know. This beast lost a lot of blood.
Well, Dr. Zira? This is a man, is he not?
Proceed. But don't turn this hearing into a farce.
Don't be silly. He's perfectly tame.
Huh?
What signal?
Forget it. Abandon ship.
We're here to stay.
We're some three hundred and twenty light years from Earth. On an unnamed planet in orbit around a star in the constellation of Orion.  That could be Bellatrix.
There's only one reality left. We're here and it's now. You get ahold of that and hang on tight, or you might as well be dead.
Climb off me, will you!
You're our optimist Look at the bright side. If that's the best there is around here, in six months we'll be running this planet.
I think you're making a mistake.
What?
Dr. Zira! Silence that man!
Then why is he called the accused Your Honors must think him guilty of something.
Thank you for calling me Taylor.  Dr. Zaius, I know who I am. Who are you? How did this upside down civilization ever get started?
I'm not protecting anybody! That hearing was a farce. What have I done?
When were the Sacred Scrolls written?
That's lunacy. I can give an alternate description for everyone of those objects that's equally as inventive as yours. But it would be conjecture, not proof.
He might have been wiped out by a plague. Natural catastrophe. Like a fiery storm of meteors. From the looks of this part of your planet, I'd say that was a fair bet.
My - name - isn't - Bright Eyes It's Taylor!
Shhhh!
Which one?
Taylor -- just keep quiet and we may get away with this. Remember that men all look alike to most apes.
You're going back to the Forbidden Zone?
Yes.
She's not sick at all.  She's pregnant.
Why not?
We can't.
All right, but....  ...you're so damned ugly!
God bless you.
He doesn't know.
He won't survive.  Do you know what sort of life awaits you out there, Taylor? That of an animal. If you aren't eventually hunted down and killed by apes, some jungle beast will devour you.
I thought it was O'Neill's turn tonight.
Barnes, listen to me... there's 5-6 spiderholes back there  next to the church.  Third Platoon's coming up the stream to reinforce us. Flank's wide open, dinks get 3-4 snipers in these holes, when Third Platoon comes up, they'll get us in a crossfire with 'em. We'll shoot each other to shit, then they'll hit us with everything they got. It'll be a massacre!
De fool think he's gonna get it but he ain't known for his thinking.
That reminds me, I gotta take a shit.
Fuck this shit! I ain't dyin' in no white man's war! Ise didi-ing this motherfuckah!
What?
Hang tough, Gator. Hang in there, man, you're gonna be OK... just hang on.
Then what do you suggest big shot?
You guys trying to cure the headache by cutting off the head. 'Lias didn't ask you to fight his battles and if there's a Heaven - and god, I hope so - I know he's sitting up there drunk as a fuckin' monkey and smokin' shit cause HIS PAINS HE DONE LEFT DOWN HERE. Baaaaaaaaa! 
Out there man - behind the log.
Yeah. I love this place at night. The stars... there's no right or wrong in them, they're just there.
Do you believe that stuff about... knowing you're gonna die?
Well sometimes a man jes don' wanna go back. How you gonna talk to civilians man? People back in the world just don't give a shit, y'know what I mean, to them you're a fuckin' animal is all -
...there's nobody.
Politics man, fuckin' politics. That O'Neill man got his nose so far up Top's ass he gotta be Pinocchio...
They're on their way...  There's a gook village half a klik downriver, Battalion wants us to move in and search it ASAP, something's going on... where's Barnes?
Why the fuck didn't you do something Lieutenant!
Maybe but I seen it happen at Ia Drang in '66, First Cavalry and they cut us to fuckin' pieces!  Give me three men, if I'm wrong, I can still roll up that flank.
Found it. Growing in a garden.
...and you know how many times he done been shot?  Seven times!  Seven.
Yeah, you done said it. Revenge on US.
Barnes took a bullet right there. At Ia Drang Valley...  And the cocksucker SURVIVED - that's BAAAD man. That's his high, baby. High on WAR!
I don't want to hear your problems, Jackson. You'll get new men any day. Time being you make do like everybody else.
I don't want to hear about it Jackson.
My name's Larry Mitchell. I live in Vancouver.
How far does this train go?
I'm supposing.
I'm not in the mood for dining and dancing.
How do you do?
Maybe you're going to have to like me.
Just drunk enough.
Next time you try that, Mr. Mitchell...  ..don't. I'm warning you.
How soon can I get a plane to Seattle?
Bank?
No, please.
I see.
What did you say his name was?
I never pay for anything. They just keep me here to amuse the guests.
Whatever you say.
I don't know you and you don't know me. I made a reasonably polite suggestion. But I'm sure you'd rather be alone.
No thank you.
He got in here how?
On a train. He said he lived here, and he offered to make a reservation for me.
I'd rather wait until it does matter.
Let's not pretend Mitchell meant anything to either of us.
Just who are you, anyway?
He was following us--but he's not a policeman.
No matter. There's nothing I can do about it.
Nothing matters.
So have I.
There's another man--right outside the booth here.  I never saw him Before.
That wasn't why I called you.  Why did I hope--when I hadn't any right to hope?
How bad is the other thing?  The secret?
This must have cost a fortune.
You leave it.
I told you my father died in jail. He stole a fortune.  Most of it pretty dirty money.  I don't care to have that known.
You-killed-him?
It is?
I've never been to Florida.
Nobody can help me. You, least of all.
I don't want to talk.
There must be-- but when I'm with you I can't find it.
Points very straight to her.
What does he see?
Looking for peanuts, I suppose.
Because you think your in love with me?
To do what?
What will they do to you?
I've been a soldier too.  There is a difference.  A policeman, like a judge, has a right to disqualify himself on proper grounds.
I hope he can prove it.  Come on. You don't want to get pneumonia.
Who's Goble?
Charlie's suits me fine. I don't scare.
Fascinated.
I've got good ears.
The new ones are fine. The last set I had gave me all kinds of trouble.
I don't like to be tailed. The lady I'm with doesn't like to be stared at. To put the matter in a couple of nutshells, I don't like you.
How's life treating you?
Yes, I've seen it before.
I rather thought so. And before that, had you ever seen the gun?
If it doesn't take too long.  Drink?
I never notice the view after the first week.
That must hurt.
I'm afraid they do.  Far too often. So long.
What?
You don't throw guests out, Brandon.
I see out friend Larry Mitchell is with us again.
I don't think you locked your door.
Or--since one is a well-known and respected guest--one could go to the desk in the lobby and say "Miss Mayfield seems to have lost her room key--have you another"?  They always have another.
And now that he's safe from all other women, you can go on loving him.
Sardonic, if you will my dear. Bust nasty. You lied about the gun.
That's not enough.
He was very easy to hate. If you'll look in your mirror, when you are in a better temper- you'll know why.
Floater?
Swimming with his hat on?  That's original.
Go live in a tent.
One of those nice long manila envelopes--sealed.  Not too fat- not too thin.
They tell me he'll be a great loss to the liquor trade. This Mayfield girl...
Correct, Inspector. A woman's gun. U.S. 125 caliber ammunition in it. It was on a table in there.
So the shell ought to have gone over?
I'll know when I find it.
Such as?
Well.  What about it?
He could have tried.  If he was up there in the dark, listening, he'd know when she came home, know when she found Mitchell dead, know what she did about it.  If she telephoned, he'd probably hear that.
Warm water, no doubt.
Positive?
That depends upon your motive. You were in love with Mitchell, weren't you?
You didn't play it for laughs last night.
Not if it clears the air.
I'm interested in who handled it.
The card says so, doesn't it?
A little of both, sir, and perhaps not quiet enough of either.
Yes, sir.
I do.
As thoroughly as I could. It wasn't easy. But you are helping me.
Splendid. Now she can return the compliment.
You know what would happen to you if I turned these over to the police?
I seem to recognize this routine. First the kiss then the touch.  Oh, what's the use. You're you.
You already have the checks, darling.
Thanks.
Actually, we've only just met. But we're quiet good friends.
Didn't Evelyn Waugh say that the country under Atlee seemed to be under enemy occupation?
Not too bad, thanks.  How have you been?
She's fine.  Well, actually we've broken up.  It's all over.
A glamorous young lady way above his station...
No, it's all right.  I can get a cab.  Night night.
I think it went on rather too long.
Who?
I don't trust anyone.  That's what comes of working in television.
That'll be fun
Oh ... excuse me.  There's Nicholas.
I know.  I'm sorry.
One or two.  A grey lot.  Some social democrats.  Some diligent anti-communists.  A political section man from the US Embassy. And this exquisite Californian wine, courtesy of the CIA.
No jokes.  James is in love.
Let me see.
Oh yes.
Let me see.
Sorry.  Got held up.  What are you doing here?
I'm not sure.
Are you up to something?
You're a piece of shit
She said awfully sorry, make yourself comfortable, she won't be long. .
She's not my mother, anyway.  My mother's in Italy.
Suez.  1956.
Oh she knows you're very busy, especially now, with everything going on...the doctor said to try her on solids, but she's been right off her food...You take this up to her.  Tell her you made it.  She'll like that.
Yes, you said.
Oh no!
Tom . .. bed!  Go on.
Only make bets I can't afford to lose.  Only way to be 100% committed.
A flaw I'm working on.
You do it... you first!
You first!
Wild, ain't it?!  See, we exist on a higher plane, you and I.  We make our own rules.  Why be a servant of the law Johnny U... when you can be it's master?
And let my policy expire?  Sorry.
Pull it right now or I'll blow your fucking head off and pull it myself!
1322 last year in LA county.  Up 26 percent from the year before.
Caught my first tube this morning.
Take your hand off my shoulder right now.
Punk.  Quarterback Punk.
The lab made three possible matches, this was one of 'em.
No.  But let's do it, anyway.  It's gonna bug the shit out of Harp.
Thanks, buddy.
This Zen master surfer.
Did he rob it?
No way.  Not yet.  Come on.
Sure.  No problem.  I'll just call up and tell him his favorite agent saw this one surfer moon another surfer yesterday and it looked real suspicious.  Shit, he'll probably call out the National Guard.
They took a left at the next light!
Figured you did.
I need you to teach me.
We went out for about five minutes... which is four minutes longer than most of them.  But you can't hold it against him, he's... different.
What?
Betadyne doesn't hurt.
Tyler, put the gun down.
Those cabinet members are very important to our scope of operations in this part of the world. They're about to get squeezed. We can't let that happen. I needed someone who could get the job done, quick and quiet... no screw-ups. I needed the best. The best. So, I pulled a few strings at the State Department... and here we are.
Because I told you, you're the best. I knew you could do it but I couldn't get you in here without a cover story.
Bullshit. You're just like the rest of us.
Now what, Dutch. You going to send your mystery guest an invitation?
Anytime.
We found 'em both, dead. And the gear from the chopper. If they're Central American, I'm a fuckin' Chinaman. By the looks of 'em, I'd say our cabinet minister and his aide are CIA.  Another thing, Major, we were lucky... couple of those guys we waxed are Russians, military advisors by the look of it. Something big was about to happen here.
Can't say, Major... been squirrely all mornin'... fuckin' weird... sometimes I think that nose of his is too good... smells things that ain't there.
I'll take him.
We figure we've got less than twenty-four hours to catch up with them. After that, there's not much hope. We want a rescue operation mounted tonight. That doesn't give you much time.
What's that, General?
I don't think that was any ordinary army taxi...
I think it's Hawkins.
No wonder.  For starts, you should know that hot pants are <u>horrid</u>, even when you do have the legs to carry them off.  What are your plans while you're in town?
You'll want a cocktail dress then.  Turn.  You have a beautiful figure.  A little too out in the open but simply lovely.  Size six? Do you need shoes?
Twenty-five percent.
I do.  I take it all very personally.  Very nice meeting you, Vivian.
I'd like to find out.  You don't know anything about me either. That's why people have lunch.
You're very right.  I think the best thing we could all do is go home.
Okay, what <u>ho</u>tel?
Yeah, I peed in the fountain there once.  Give me a break.
It pays.
For an hour.
Edward.  My name is Edward.
You mean they don't have hookers.
Just a romantic, that's you.
Yeah.  Too good.  I forgot where I was.
I took the couch.  I had some work to do.  About last night...
I like guys if that's what you're asking.  Not that I trust'm.
Sorta like stealing cars and selling'm for parts, huh?
There, see?  Now the emblem is right in the middle of the knot.
I fucked the debate team in high school.  Tsk.  I had a grampa. He liked ties on Sundays.  You mind if I take a swim in your bathtub before I hit it?
Vivian, may I point out five more nights at three hundred a night is only 1,500.
Whether I liked him or not is irrelevant.  It's business. There's no emotion involved in business... if you want to survive.
Television?
Please.
No.
Not much to tell.  I went to public school.  Went to university on scholarship.  Went to work for an investment firm. In eight years I owned it.  My father was chairman of the board of the third company I ever went after.  I swallowed that company and shit out the pieces. One of the pieces was him.
I think it's exciting.
He's good at what he does.
I'm sure that's true for some of them.
Ready to stomp sod?
Vivian...
I'll guard them and you with my life.
I'll whisper some of the main parts of the story to you.  But you'll be surprised how much you understand.  The music conveys the story more powerfully than any words.
I more than liked it.
You just did.
Yes.  The man made a business decision.
Thank you.
No.
Oh, god, what?
I'm here.
We don't have the time to bring someone new up to speed. Besides...  You've already impressed everyone you need to, haven't you?
Eight o'clock.  Kross is bringing his son.  Very bright kid, watch yourself with him.  Who's this girl you're taking?
But, Edward...
The night I left your house, I was lost.  I was looking for directions.
Yes...
I suppose you'd use them as collateral on new loans, wouldn't you?
And I don't like what we've become.  I'll cover any losses you have on this one.  Now get out, you asshole!
I bet.  That was our rent!
Maybe we should get a pimp. Carlos likes you and --
Kit!  Where've you been?
Dummy.
I pray for that.
No.  You took care of rent, that's enough.
Kit give me nothin'.
What?
I also place las chocolates on the pillow.
And who is that?
Will I like it?
But I always eat like this.
Hmmm... I vonder vich. 
But what if they serve soup?
Steak spoon! 
Maybe I'll just order a burger, Barney, that way I can eat with my hands.
Mr. Harris doesn't check out until tomorrow.
You're not accompanying him to New York?
Certain ladies make that very easy... Vivian.  John, call a limousine for our guest, please.  Have it take her anywhere she wishes to go.  Bill the hotel.  See you again sometime soon.
Excuse me?
Don't worry.  I'll pay for it. What a you charge?  Huh?  Twenty, thirty, fifty bucks, <u>maybe</u>?  Are you a fifty dollar whore?
May I live a thousand years and never hunt again.
You're a silly girl.
Then why is there fear behind your eyes?
I was giving you a chance. No matter where you take me ... there's no greater hunter than Prince Humperdinck. He could track a falcon on a cloudy day. He can find you
"Are not capable of love" is what you mean.
I know who you are -- your cruelty reveals everything.
Hardly complimentary, Your Highness. Why loose your venom on me?
Nothing you can say will upset me.
As you wish.
This is true love. You think this happens every day?
Nonsense -- you're only saying that because no one ever has. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           57.
Westley, what about the R.O.U.S.'s?
It never happened.
It never happened. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          117.
Who's Guilder?
I just don't think it's right, killing an innocent girl.
Anybody want a peanut?
What do I do?
He's really very short on charm.
Yes, some of the time. 
That leaves twenty for me. At my best, I could never defeat that many.  I need Vizzini to plan. I have no gift for strategy. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           82.
Over the Albino, I think.
I tell you once again -- surrender!
No.  To the pain.
Yes.
Oh, I know. The people are quite taken with her. It's odd, but when I hired Vizzini to have her murdered on our engagement day, I thought that was clever. But it's going to be so much more moving when I strangle her on our wedding night. Once Guilder is blamed, the nation will be truly outraged. They'll demand we go to war.
I'll beat you both apart. I'll take you both together.
There we cannot help you.
-- power too -- promise me that --
He's already dead.
What's that?
Okay. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           97.
Look, I don't mean to be rude, but this is not as easy as it looks. So I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't distract me.
That's very comforting. But I'm afraid you'll just have to wait.
My father was slaughtered by a sixfingered man. He was a great swordmaker, my father. And when the six-fingered man appeared and requested a special sword, my father took the job. He slaved a year before he was done.
Thank you -- I've worked hard to become so.
I would as soon destroy a stained glass window as an artist like yourself. However, since I can't have you following me either --
I don't swim. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           15.
Oh, have it your way.
Good. Then pour the wine.
You've made your decision then7
Truly, you have a dizzying intellect.
I will. And I choose --
I'm not a witch, I'm your wife. But after what you just said, I'm not even sure I want to be that anymore.
He'll pinch my cheek. I hate that.
I think this would be a marvelous opportunity for you, Roger.  Up to now, you've always been associated with musicals, and...
"Honeymoon,
I'm Leo Bloom, I'm an accountant, I'm from Whitehall and Marks, I was sent here to do your books and I'm terribly sorry I caught you with the old lady. 
Do the books!  Do the books!
Koff, koff ... ahem, ahem ... harrumph ...
Well, sir, it seems ...
Why should they find out?  It's only two thousand dollars,  Bloom, do me a favor, move a few decimal points around.  You can do it. You're an accountant.  The word 'count' is part of your title.
You keep saying that, but you don't tell me how.  How could a producer make more money with a flop than with a hit?
You've done it yourself, only you did it on a very small scale.
You raised two thousand more than you needed to produce your last play.
But what if the play was a hit?
Aha, aha, aha, aha, aha, aha!!  So, in order for the scheme to work, we'd have to find a sure fire flop.
You miserable, cowardly, wretched little caterpillar.  Don't you ever want to become a butterfly?  Don't you want to spread your wings and flap your way to glory?
Well, you know what they say, "Smile and the world smiles with you."  Heh, heh.  The man should be in a straight jacket.  Feeling better?
They certainly do.  They certainly do.  Come, let me take you to lunch.
Well, Max, I don't know, Max.  What do you think, Max?
Max, what is it?  What are you doing?  What's happening?
You found a flop!
Shut up, you idiot.  He's a harmless nut.  Play along with him.  It's almost in the bag.
Leo, what if this play is a hit?
Ahhhhhh.  Leo, Leo, Leo.
Mr. Liebkind, wait ...
We loved it.  We thought it was a masterpiece.  That's why we're here. We want to produce it on Broadway.
Really, I never dreamed ...
We swear it!
You crazy lunatic!  What are you shooting at us for?  Why don't you use this  where it will do us some good?  Why don't you shoot the actors?  Liebkind, have I ever steered you wrong?
You can count on me-o, you dirty young man.
I can't take my eyes off you.  How can I drive when you drive me mad. Mad.
Ta.  Ta.
Oh, I'd better hurry back.  I don't want to miss one minute of it.
Oh, ve come vit you.  All for one and all in the light.
What do you do best?
Oh, sing.  Sing!
Hey, man, let's stomp Switzerland!
Heil, baby!  I just finished the morning propaganda broadcasts.
Sit down. I don't want to trouble you, just want to ask...
No one met her?
How do you know she didn't make a call?
She isn't still here, is she?
Someone is sitting in that window.
If she paid you well?
I didn't mean that as a slur on your manhood. I'm sorry.
No. Thank you. I'm in... a hurry. I just want to make a change and start...
Of course not. Please.
I think I have the necessary papers. Is there a Ladies Room...
Teddy called.  Me... And my mother called to see if Teddy called. Oh, and your sister called to say she's going to Tucson to do some buying and she'll be gone the whole weekend and...
Now. Your sister is missing how long?
A lot?
And the police haven't been able to...
Like what?
Sorry I got you up, boy. Go back to sleep. Yeah, be glad to.  Said to give you his regards.
Mr. Loomis, you're so busy being defensive that you haven't even reacted to the most serious fact of all. Mary is missing.
Where's the old highway?
Yes.
Patience doesn't run in our family. Sam, I'm going out there!
An hour! Or less!
Sam.
Where could he have gone?
Who's he?
I know.  Do you think if something happened, it happened there?
How could we prove...  Well, if he opens a new motel on the new highway... say, a year from now...
Why not?
When you're married you can do a lot of things deliberately.
Sam. This is the last time.
Can you?
You make respectability sound... disrespectful.
I pay, too. They also pay who meet in hotel rooms.
I'm late... and you have to put your shoes on.
You have a vacancy?
The bathroom.
You'd know, of course.
What are you running away from?
I was born in mine. I don't mind it anymore.
To a private island, like you?
I'm sorry... I didn't mean it to sound uncaring...
I am sorry. I only felt... it seemed she was harming you. I meant...
I'm very tired. And I'll have a long drive tomorrow. All the way back to Phoenix.
Is there what?  I've told you there's nothing wrong... except that I'm in a hurry and you're taking up my time...
I'm sorry.
Now what?
Yes. He traced her to that motel, out on the old highway...
He traced her there and called us to say he was going to question Mrs. Bates...
Maybe you saw Mary!
At this hour?
Yes, matter of fact.  The wife's taking a nap and... I can never keep quiet enough for her... so I thought I'd look you up and... talk.
I didn't think so.
Shut up!
Mother, she's just a stranger... hungry, and the weather's bad...
Left Phoenix under her own steam?
You must've seen an illusion, Sam. Now, I know you're not the seeing- illusion type... But no woman was illusion there and I don't believe in ghosts, so there it is!
[Was it] &quot;Meirschultz&quot;?
[Perfectly friendly, my dear.] At last, I have really a secure living for us. We can travel or anything we choose.
Sure--I have one little job to accomplish, then we can leave together. No doubt you are surprised at this disguise.
Quiet, will you? This is ser- ious. Our lives are in danger.
How about me getting the help. She's quiet now, isn't she?
No--I don't want to give any money. Everybody wants money--I'm not going to give any money.
Maybe you're right.
Well, news of Buckley?
He isn't here.
The wound is bleeding!
No?
I wondered. Did he invite you to lunch, or did you invite him?
I just had a picture of you telling a landlady some day that you didn't have the rent, but Ralph is awful sweet.
I met one last night ... all the money this side of Peoria.
I don't think you could have a real affair. You couldn't care for anyone.
Yeah, but they leave you plenty.
Don't kid yourself -- she means it.
The body of Joan Gale!
What do you mean, you poor ham! This is New Year's!
If this kid was some unknown soda jerker, they wouldn't have pinched him. But he's George Winton and they're playing him up. It's a Roman holiday for every paper hat editor in New York.
Well, that's got nothing to do with this case. Can I handle this my way?
Nope, I'm through!
No kiddin'. What's your idea?
About the Gale girl, I mean. Where do we go from there? What of it?
That dear, innocent Judge Ramsey that you were so sure got bumped off for knowing too much has been located in South America.
Go on, little girl, take your troubles somewhere else. I don't feel like talking to you.
What goofy idea have you got now? Don't tell me you suspect Judge Ramsey of stealing the body.
Where were you going when you got in that cab?
Don't remember what day that was, do you?
No, sir, I'm sure it wasn't there.
Well, maybe it was. I don't remember.  You got to do something for me, I can't stand it any longer -- I can't!
How's every little thing?
Horsefeathers!
Cry-baby?
Who'd steal her body?
Good night, sir.
Yes, there's our way out. A fire in this place would give us ten thousand pounds.
And they are welcome to them. To perpetuate such creatures is to celebrate their crimes.
One of the maids-in-waiting for that Elizabethan group.
To lunch, you say. I am having coffee and sandwiches sent in. We are not leaving until we have everything ready for the opening.
If you leave before the work is done, you will be gone for a much longer period ... you will be gone for good.
Quite so. Quite so.  And you, my little friend, my little Marie Antoinette. It is kind of you to be present.
Yes, sir, it's here on the truck, but it's pretty heavy -- I'll need help.
I wonder if I could have her pose for me.
He can't hear you.
Dad...
You did.
It's an experiment.
God.  I dunno.  The eternal nothingness. Mia.
Inside every semi-conductor... you have two particles, with opposite charges, separated by an impassable barrier...
This isn't punishment, I don't believe in punishment. It's for your health. Obviously you're sick if you can act like that.
Buddy, I am wandering in a wilderness, lost.  I just feel awful. Do you mind if I get in bed with you for a little while?
But, Rose, how could such a thing as that happen?
Ha ha ha, that's some idea, a cantaloupe.
Buddy, what's come over you? A child like you, askin' such things.
Buddy, you don't realize it but what you're doing isn't nice.
Hmmph. It has a nipple, all right.
That was very interesting. Thank you, Rose.
Rose, I have a serious favor to ask you.
I'm curious to see what it's like. I'm very curious, Rose.
But Rose...
I have a knack for designing clothes. But I had to buy the shoes and the pocketbook.
He did?
I don't want to know...
Oh, Waski, you don't even know what we're talking about.
Quiet, you little muddy-eyed brat, or Ill kill you!
Oh, Waski, you don't even know what we're talking about.
Yeah, he's still up there.
I don't know. But you better watch him like a hawk, if he comes back again.
Well... maybe...
Mother, I have to tell the truth. I wasn't reading Huckleberry Finn, I was reading one of those Little Dirty Comic Books.
What did you say, Brother?
No, you didn't say that, Brother.
I get so irritated with Daddy. He's so dumb sometimes.
At least.
You shouldn't watch such things, Doll.
She hasn't got any sense. In some ways, she's awful dumb.
Mother is struggling desperately. In fact she's fighting like a tiger. But I don't know, it's close, it's mighty close.
That's the least of her troubles. Rose had a rare tropic disease and the little tubes in her that babies swim down are all stopped up, she told me all about it.
Hello, Daddy. How are you?
Dave Wilkie of all people was sitting by me on the plane -- her first husband. It's funny you would mention Rose. Did you hear from her?
Um-hmm, and I suppose that incensed you?
At rest in the creative universe with Mother, son.
Not for long, boy. I've outstayed my welcome already.
I am afraid so, son. About a week ago. Her husband phoned me, she had asked him to call me if anything happened.
Then... may I speak quite frankly with you, Mr. Hillyer?
Well, well, well. So Miss Rosebud has arrived. Un-hmm. And you're all assembled here. Yes, indeed. Un hmmm.
Yes, it's so nice I thought I'd work outside.
Hope for the best? I don't understand all this skepticism. I thought you liked Rose.
You are the one who's good-hearted.  As for Rose, let's hope for the best.
No reason at all, darlin'.
Yes, darlin', time will tell.
And when I try to talk to you seriously, when I try to explain to you the unlimited creative power of life, how beautiful it would be if we gave up this hopeless struggle and simply loved each other from our hearts, what do you do -- you mock me!
But what I said is the simple truth. And now I see something else, I see more deeply into it...
Well, I have a pretty good idea.
Darlin', Rose has got to go!
Um-hmm.  Come with me, Brother. I want to show you something.
Trickery and flummery or not, she's going there tomorrow on the bus! It's settled! And I must say we've been more than fair to you, Rose, it's pretty selfish and mean hearted of you to sit there and cry like that!
But she must know... unless... unless... Rose, was there more than one person?
Honey, that's no way to talk to the Doctor, he's merely doing his job, dear.
I... I'll get the grits.
Yes, crazy about you! Kiss me, Mr. Hillyer!
Oh-h, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Mr. Hillyer... I just... couldn't help myself. I'm sorry...
Nothin', just goin' to the bathroom.
Well, it has buttons.
Oh, I'll just mosey around here and there.
It'll do just fine.  Bye-bye, see you later.
Yes, Mr. Hillyer, it was. I... I heard strange voices in the night.
I have to go back to the hotel. I'm on duty at the desk and who knows a quest might arrive. I will see you at suppertime, Rose.
Well, it's Billy.
What's the use, there ain't none.
Yes, sir.
All right, damn it. We've seen you with your clothes off around here, stand up and pull up your dress and let's take a look!
Awww-rr, Buddy, come on, you know me!
Yeah, it took her a while to grow up and find Mr. Right, but she did it. She found him.
Yeah, I'll do that, Dave.
What do you want me to tell her, Dave?
Daddy wouldn't hear that. Now the redhaired boy you see sitting there, of course you have met him, he is my oldest son and my most brilliant child. All children have great creative powers, but I don't want to rattle on about my children, they say I brag too much about them, especially about Brother. Am I boring you, Rose?
Mother, Buddy says Rose got in his bed last night and he fiddled with her and she snorted and had a fit -- and he says I would too if I was grown-up. Is it true, Mother -- would I sweat and snort and froth at the mouth and have a horrible fit like he says?
Well, her people were very poor. She says she was often hungry as a child, and I'm sure the food she ate was pretty awful, not a balanced diet at all.
What do you mean, what kind of gobbledygook talk is that?
Illusions, Madam?
That would scare her to death. She's terrified of hospitals. To her, a hospital is where you go to die.
Well, it's rather interesting about Brother, actually. I realized the remarkable thing he had when he was six weeks old. He looked at me and understood me, he knew exactly who I was. I know it sounds crazy but it's true. He's very remarkable, he was born for the ministry and could move millions, but he doesn't know that yet. I have to warn you about him, he can be very dangerous, there is an evil streak in him, a streak of pure sheer meanness. But at heart Brother is saintly and that is why he was born for the ministry even if he doesn't know it.
Rose, you work too hard. Why don't you go sit down somewhere and drink a Co-Cola?
Yes, Ma'am.
Oh... oh... oh! I think... maybe... one of 'em... was Foster... but I don't hardly know him!
It'll get better now.
Yes, ma'am.
I'm looking at this poster, and I'm thinkin', I don't remember seeing films like this when I was in school.
What were you gonna say?  Exactly how did you think he was gonna make the leap from dating a sweet, innocent school teacher to an ass-fucking porn star?
I figure, for this information, the usual payment... times ten.
I'll tell you what... I think it's all you've got.
Now you know what to watch for...
Read my lips: Zimmermann or nothing.
Fair enough.
Where you been hiding, grease-fist? We've been looking for you.
Really?  Is that a fact... ?
I don't know what you're talking about, man.  Even if I did, I'm not so crazy I'm gonna cross Zimmermann.
Alright!  Alright... put me down...
I need the "when" and the "where."
Filthy kids go to kindergarten too. What are you saying, anyhow?
Lay off once, would you?
It's the way you say it, like there's something more too it.
We catch 'em, I wanna be first to hurt 'em.  Promise me I get to go first.
I'd rather you guys didn't do this again.
I'm just saying...
They shot us all, kid.
We're gonna rain on Zimmermann's parade.
Yeah.  Happy Fourth of July.
"Leo.  The stages of the moon are in alignment, so now is a perfect time for a vigorous regimen of self improvement.  Wash yourself more carefully each morning, stop using pies and cakes as your primary source of nourishment, and quit tucking your shirttails inside your underwear."
It's go time, Billy-B.
Just keep an eye out till I get this rig up and running.
We're not stealing.  We're borrowing.
This is the police lock-up.  We're police.  How can we steal from ourselves?
There'll be other chances.
You can't be serious.
You're about an inch away from insubordination!
Till the last firework fizzles out tonight, detective, you sit a desk. And, after that, I'll decide if you keep your shield.
Going into Zimmermann's pipeline.
Let's hope.
I worked my ass off for my badge, Kittle,  It's the only thing that makes me different from every other slob out there.
Guys... all we've got is each other. Don't we know that by now?
Dead.
Sounds good.
Just got here.
A.D. is a C.P.A.
I'm well aware of that.
Well, that's what I heard, and that's what I choose to believe.
Yeah.
We'll last longer then we will against that Death Star...and we might just take a few of them with us.
I also thought he could be turned back to the good side. It couldn't be done. He is more machine now than man. Twisted and evil.
I can't kill my own father.
But I have no sister.
Leia! Leia's my sister.
You have done well, Lord Vader. And now I sense you wish to continue your search for young Skywalker.
A small Rebel force has penetrated the shield and landed on Endor.
Luke!
Quietly, there might be more of them out there.
It's against my programming to impersonate a deity.
Well, I suppose I could hotwire this thing.
You may dispense with the pleasantries, Commander. I'm here to put you back on schedule.
Red Leader standing by.
You're wrong, Leia. You have that power too. In time you'll learn to use it as I have. The Force is strong in my family. My father has it...I have it...and...my sister has it.
I will not fight you, father.
Yes.
I am fluent in over six million forms of communication, and can readily...
Shush.  Janet's probably asleep by now. Do you want her to see you like this?
And now he works for your Government, doesn't he, Brad?  He's attached to the Bureau of Investigation of that which you call U.F.O's.  Isn't he, Brad?
I've got something to say.
Dammit, Janet.
We must have a blow-out.
There's no point both of us getting wet.
Oh, it's probably some kind of hunting lodge for rich weirdos.
For God's sake keep a grip on yourself Janet.
We can't go anywhere until I get to a phone.
Let's wait awhile Janet.  We don't want to interfere with their celebrations.
We'll just say where we are Then go back to the car We don't want to be any worry.
Yes, Dr Scott.  A laser capable of emitting a beam of pure anti-matter.
A decision had to be made.
I didn't make him for you
Goodbye
Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
No no no no.
Ain't skated since I was fifteen -- That's when I started fightin' -- gotta watch the ankles. Yeah, fightin' use to be tops with me, but no more. All I wanted to prove was I weren't no bum -- That I had the stuff to make a good pro.
Absolutely.
Ohh!
No, I don't belong here.
Don't tease me.
I don't know -- I was shocked. Why did you do that?
They either say, 'Kill the nigger' or 'Hope you die, Honky.' -- What ya got in the bag?
-- The legs.
Yo -- I ain't mad. I'm just outta joint when reporters are around -- They take cheap shots an' Paulie knows it.
...What?
...What?
Hey, I want ya out instamaticly. -- I'm sicka lookin' at ya hangin' around like a friggin' spider -- Go out -- Live! Do, enjoy life.
Christ.
That so.
You's the novelty, Champ!
Southpaw, nuthin' -- I'll drop 'im in three -- 'Apollo Creed meets the Italian Stallion.' Shhiii -- Sounds like a damn monster movie!!
Don't play with this man, he's fightin' hard -- Let 'em feel some real heat!
Luck! You fightin' a crazy man -- but you got him hurt bad.  More ice, now!
I suppose we could cancel the fight indefinitely if you are set on fighting Green.
Shaw's fighting in South America -- Why not postpone the bout until July Fourth?
Apollo, I'm sure there's a way to salvage this.
...This man.
That's right -- It's gonna be the greatest sportin' event in this country's history -- A gala occurrence!
The Bicentennial Heavyweight Championship of the World is gonna be held in the only place it can be held -- Philadelphia! -- the nation's cradle -- January First -- the first major event of our two hundredth year.
Wait here, gotta smooth this guy out.
This guy is beautiful -- get the Cokes.
I agree.
Yo' know I iz the best man here! Yo' said so yoself!
Not yellow, cautious.  See, it's very easy for a fighter to accidentally hurt --
Mr. Gazzo says I should get two hundred or break the thumb.
Bob.
That's it, I'm broke.
Hey -- if a good man can make a better life, let him make it.
Do I have to pay juice?
...Thanks.
I know ya need sparrin' partners -- I'm very available.
Absolutely -- Sparrin' with the Champ would be an honor -- y'know what?
Maybe I like garbage.
Why?
I said, how ya feelin'?
Yeah, they're goin', -- that's nature... That was my locker for six years.
You think everybody I fight is a bum.
Hey, Mickey -- Whatta ya doin' here? Here, sit down.
How do you mean?
Freak luck is a strange thing.
Rocky, d'ya know what I done?
...Ya gave Dipper my locker.
The fight's set -- I don't need a manager.
I got pain an' experience too.
I never had good footwork.
I get the robe an' Paulie gets three grand.
Whatta ya think that outfit cost?
Thanks, Mick -- I'm gonna try.
Breathe deep -- Keep ya chin down!! Use the legs and drive through 'im. Attack -- Attack -- Attack!
Damn! How's it look?
See what?
Listen, I'm with you -- But ya gotta talk to Mickey -- I put ya stuff in the bag over there.
We're not responsible for animals left over thirty days -- We board it ain't a animal shelter, Y'know... Adrian, I want you to clean all those cat cages downstairs, they're a mess. 
Yo, Rocky -- Look at this mirror. I'd like to kill the friggin' moron who broke this mirror.
Sometimes she gets me so crazy, I'd like to split her head with a razor.
I don't see no crowd around you, neither.
Look at my hands -- See how the joints are swollen.
Maybe another job is the best thing.
Try again, c'mon, try again.
Y'know, to help keep ya livin' clean.
Ya gotta have a guy help ya exercise, mebbe somebody to be standin' by with a towel or run errands, y'know.
...No.
Yo, what's with you? -- It was suppose to be private.
What can I do about it?
...People talk to me more.
Do you have anything derogatory to say about the Champion?
Four hundred -- But that was a long time ago.
You serve martinis, doncha?
My problem is I got a fifty-year-old lust and a three-year-old dinkie.
C'mon, Valiant, doesn't this whole thing smell a bit funny to you?  I mean, no offense, but how did a mucky-muck like R.K. Maroon find you in the first place?
Wish I could say the same.  What're you doin' here, Betty?
You'll have it in the morning.  Now be a sport and lemme have twenty bucks to put in my pocket.
No kiddin'?  Bought the Red Cars, huh?
He's a Toon... who cares?
Probably lookin' for a good place to stick a knife.
I'll bet.
What've I got to lose?  You okay, Dolores?
Yes, we talked to Mr. Maroon.  He told us the rabbit became quite agitated when you showed him the pictures, and said nothing would stand in the way of him getting his wife back.  Is that true?
They won't care.  Who's going to miss some ridiculous talking mice when they can have the future?
Okay, you've seen me.  Now give me a towel.
We're even.  By the way, I did find your husband.
Marvin told me.  Doom was after his land.  Ne was afraid.  That's why he brought me his will.
When I opened up the blue envelope, all that was inside was a blank piece of paper.
That's what you woke me up for?
What a gasser.
That's how he gets rid of the troublemakers.  It's a combination of acetone, turpentine and paint remover. He calls it the...  Final Solution.
He was blowin' his lines, all right. So what?
One too many safes dropped on his head?
Aren't you the lucky one...
Valiant?  What're you doin' here?
Take it easy.
Don't do that!  I'm innocent I tell ya. The police'll just dip me.  They were waitin' for me when I got home last night.  I ran.
Yeah, that's better.
Well, no, not <u>any</u> time.  Only when it was funny.
A blindfold, cigarette, noseplugs? Just kidding.
My brother.  Get inside.
How much is a shave and a haircut, Roger?
I guess I am at that.  Cigar?
Uh? Uh?
It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?
Of love?
But 'tis no wit to go.
Art thou hurt?
I pay thy poverty, and not thy will.
Benedicite! What early tounge so sweet saludeth me?
The last is true; the sweeter rest was mine.
O deadly sin, O rude unthankfulness! This is dear mercy and thou sees it not. Hence!
And all this day an unaccustomed spirit lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts. I dreampt my lady came and found me dead and breathed such life with kisses in my lips that I revived and was an emperor. Ah me, how sweet is love itself possessed when but love's shadow's are so rich in joy. News from Verona. How now, Balthasar?! Dost thou not bring me letters from the Priest? How doth my lady? Is my Father well? How doth my lady Juliet? For nothing can be ill if she be well.
Romeo, come forth.
Madam, in happy time what day is that?
No, madam. We have culled such necessaries as our behoveful for our state tomorrow. so please you, let me now be left alone, and let the nurse this night sit up with you. for I am sure you have your hands full in all this so sudden business.
Madam, I am here. What is your will?
Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not how to choose a man: Romeo! no, not he; though his face be better than any man's, yet his leg excels all men's; and for a hand, and a foot, and a body,
Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a courteous, and a kind, and a handsome, and, I warrant, a virtuous,--Where is your mother?
O lady dear! Are you so hot? Henceforward do your messages yourself.
Amen
Sin from my lips? O trespass sweetly urged! Give me my sin again.
Romeo, O Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo? Deny thy father and refuse thy name; Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love, And I'll no longer be a Capulet.
'Tis but thy name that is my enemy; Thou art thyself, though not a Montague. What's Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot, Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part Belonging to a man. O, be some other name! What's in a name? that which we call a rose By any other word would smell as sweet; So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd, Retain that dear perfection which he owes Without that title. O Romeo, doff thy name, And for that name which is no part of thee Take all myself.
With love's light wings did I o'er-perch these walls; For stony limits cannot hold love out, And what love can do that dares love attempt; Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.
Well what shall I swear by?
O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
A thousand times good night! Exit, above
Let me be taken, let me be put to death. I have more care to stay then will to go. Come death, Welcome, Juliet wills it so. How is't my soul? Let us talk it is not day.
I doubt it not. Trust me, love, all these woes shall serve for sweet discourses in our times to come. Adieu.
Nay, he's a flower; in faith, a very flower.
In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.
That's as much as to say, such a case as yours constrains a man to bow in the hams.
Thou hast most kindly hit it.
NO! Mercutio!
Consort? What does thou make us minstrels? An thou make minstrels of us look to hear nothing of discords. Here's my fiddlestick. Here's that shall make you dance! Zounds, Consort!
What wouldst thou have with me?
Leaving...
Finding this package is a thing easier said than done.  We don't even know what it is.  What did we steal?
The deal?  The deal is we leave for Nice at first light.
Which leads us to...
Best beer in the world known to man or God.
It means I was worried that all the time you spent away from the fold might have affected you.  You've been living the life of the hired gun -- the well paid hired gun, I might note.  There's no glory to it, but there are those that like it.
I probably do.  But for the time being, I'm willing to forget about it...
Duty calls?
I didn't say I was.
Alright?  It's bloody fucking freezing in here!
Not likely.  Once, yeah, I was -- but there wasn't an inch of profit in it, and I'm a cash oriented girl, if you take my meaning.  I'm a hired gun, same as the rest of you, and that's all any of us needs to know about the other.
You sure about this?
I use my cell phone to get computer access to the telecommunications satellite used by our target.  I trace his cell phone signature and use it to pin point his location as he moves through Nice, relaying that information to you.
I'm sure.  But I'm sorry to say that it's too late for trust: we have a serious problem.
I swear, it has to come here!  It has to...
It's done.
Much to your disappointment, no doubt.
Because if there's more than one party involved, if we really are working for different people, then perhaps some of us are on different sides.  Your orders might be different from mine.
That's it.
Yes, Sam's tough alright.
I know cops -- and you're no cop.
Coordinate what?
I asked if we could give him anything else.
Jujitsu.
Not at all.  Similar, but not the same.
One's a lot more painful than the other.
I have, I don't know, maybe a cigarette a week.
It has it's moments.  Course, you get cancer and die, that's the down side.
Let's just say I thought the conversational possibilities were limited.  Of course, I might have brought Gregor, but he didn't seem like the right candidate -- for this.
I needed to see if you were a cop.  I'm a popular man with the police, Sam, and whenever they try to catch me they always do it with an inside guy -- some man on some job who seems more trustworthy than all the others put together.  And that's the guy you have to watch out for.  I hate cops...
You were smoking?
Of course...whenever you feel like it just help yourself.
I won't lie -- there have been times when I had to do it, times when the only way to get out alive was to see that the other man didn't.
Not necessarily.  He could go off road at any number of places.  He might not even be in the country anymore.
I didn't save your life back there. Risked it, maybe -- but I didn't save shit.
I know of him.
If Tony says this is it, then it's it.
Not very zen of you, huh?  Not so much the modern Samurai after all.
So I do it.
If I'm going to die for the CIA, I'm going to go out smoking.  Besides, there's half a forest between us and them, they can't see a goddamned thing.
Why?  You've got more force of will than anyone I've ever seen.  You handle a gun like it's a part of you, you perform surgery on yourself without anesthesia...  And most amazing of all, you quit smoking, just like that.
Why not?
How is it these fellahs managed to get the drop on us?
The Russian would be easier.
I gotta try and overcharge him, he has to moan about the price, we settle somewhere in the middle.
I can't get enough of it.
I don't know what you're -
Well I hope so.  That pretty much cleaned me out.
I probably would have.  I guess the clues damn near before everyone.
What makes you so sure?
Oh so God's like Western Union and he just dropped us a couple million bucks?
At the expense of six people.
All right we will.
What are you gonna do?
What are you thinking?
I...I can't do that.
I don't know...
Are you nuts?  They'll fry us for sure.  There's no way we're doin' that, you understand?  No way.
Well neither have I, but it's us or him.  If he talks, or writes a note	or whatever, he's gonna turn us in.  Besides, he's just a low life scumbag.  His kind is hardly even human anyway.
I've got a better idea.  All we have to do is straighten out Jesse.
Yeah, I mean you're coming unglued, Jesse.
If you're any friend at all, you'll stop talking like that!
I don't know...we have to shut him up somehow. Booth looks at Earl --
Who said anything about killing?  Just keep driving straight...
I don't know!  Shit, give me a break!
We're doing what we gotta do, to protect ourselves!
Then we're screwed.
We'll take the money and disappear! We can do it, spend it on the move. Even if all of it's marked, there's ways around it.
He killed her...
I can't.  I can't go on.  I can't keep lying...killing.  That's not me.  That's not US.
Rock solid.
Why don't you get to the point.
How much?
Two thousand...
Just take it in stride.
Don't have much choice, Jesse. You saw to that!
Maybe.  That's where it was during Denning's last report.
Nothing.
Oh.  You coming by tonight?
I'm just tired is all.  I'll see you tonight OK baby?
I used to think he was something, once...  I was eighteen, I didn't know any better, and he had something steady to offer.
I love you Sally.
I'll be there for you.  He won't try anything while I'm there.  I promise.  I'll protect you.
It'll be more than enough.  We can get out of here...
I don't know.  My friends...
You know I do.
Could it have been this?
You didn't answer my question. Are you saying my word is of no value to you?
Excellent. I'll go down with you.
Don't you think I would have told you that!
Hell no. besides I'm just a radio call away if something happens. I feel I should keep abreast of what happens, seeing it's my jurisdiction and all.
Have you known this all along?
Did you say After Midnight?
So there was money there!  Who the hell's money is it?!
Lingerie...
Sure... DISSOLVE TO EXT HOGAN HOUSE -- NIGHT
Hi.
Anything...specific?
Hmmm...
Have I seen her?
Uh...C?
Yeah I'd say C...C.
Sure.
Oh, that's ok, a lot of men feel uncomfortable when they come in here.
All right you’re the super sleuth, what do you want, a medal?
Vegas!  Can you hightail it back here by three o'clock?
So be here at three.
I  have complete faith in you. But don't you go speeding.
I don't know...
Save me the sermon.  I've heard it all before, it's boring.
And if we refuse?  Your tampering with evidence isn't exactly a misdemeanor, did you ever consider that?
Right behind you.
So I want the money and I want it now.
You're never getting that much.
Yeah.
Nope. If you're a criminal you don't carry ID, and if you do you're a damn fool.
And what happened?
So someone did get away.
No, it doesn't.  Neither does his blank tape.  Any news on that?
Is it because of the hookers, sir?  You tell them there's no crime in being lonely.
No, I just assumed...
I'm up a hundred and fifty-grand. That's a Ferrari.  Do they sell those here in the gift shop?  Somebody cash me out!
I got held up at a wedding in Tai Koo. Ricky here yet, I need to get his requests.
Is this about the funny money?
This is your ship?
El Capitan?
I'm sure, because this is my friend's yacht.  And it's his party.
So what's your story?
In 1959, the United States was very friendly with the Shah of Iran.  We wanted his oil, so for the Shah's birthday, the government gave him a gift -- a U.S. Treasury Intaglio press.  The only one to ever leave the country. Five years ago Ricky Tan bought that press on the black market.
It's no problem.  But I must excuse myself, inspector.
Lee, you okay?
C'mon, Lee.  He's going to jail.  You won, now just put the gun down.
Vegas has been my town for 30 years.  I crawled out from under the first rock. Do you really think you can intimidate me here?
You play games with me, Detective, and you'll lose every time.  Don't forget. The odds are always in favor of the house.
Those girls drove off because of you.
No.
Are you kidding, they love me.  I'm a star, Lee.  A god to these people!
You just said you're their worst nightmare - and to line their mothers up for a milking.
How you doin'?
My bullshit?  I'm not the one who goes to a karaoke bar filled with gangsters! I'm not the one who goes to massage parlors to bust crime lords!
Who died?
Nobody understands the words that are coming out of your mouth.
I'll bitch slap you into Bangkok.
Good at what?
I cannot go to LA...
You said --
Almost, but you've got to say "Rich White Man" all run together like it's one word.
Not bad.  Now every crime, somewhere, has a rich white man taking his cut. Every single one.  Now in our case, we know the rich white man is Steven Reign.
Black people keep their cool when the shit goes down.
Hot?  I'm freezing my ass off.
Gimme the binoculars or I will shoot you.
She just took her hair down.  Now she's going for the bra -- the clasp is in front -- she's using both hands.  You better get that ice.
What?
She's walking back towards the door.
It's your turn!
We can help you.  I'm a detective in Hong Kong.
No.
There was no sex.  She was very traditional.  We were waiting until we were married.
No mu-shu.
It's focus.  Every opponent has a weak spot.  You ignore everything around you, and put all your energy into one perfect strike.
Yes he did.  He also invented the bicycle.
End of the line.
Wait a second.  We can't go in like this.  Look at this place, we gotta look fly.  We gotta Mac out.
Follow me my Asian brother.
Carter...
No problem.
She's going home to New York.  I need some ice.
It's okay, I got lots more.
Then you know I'm not walking away from this case.
Excuse me?
How do I know I can trust you?
I still have my lunch money from third grade.
I'll take him.
The police can protect you.
The bomb was meant as a demonstration of our sincerity.  If you want the Ambassador's daughter back alive, listen and do not talk.
Okay, I'll slow down.  So we go downtown and we ask you a few questions... you know, like what's your name?  How old are you?  You ever expose yourself in public...shit like that.
A little.
I am not responsible for your assumptions.
We are both full of shit.
What?
What plate?
Stooly.
Stool pigeon.
Juntao's standing orders were to kill everyone. There were never witnesses.
Who does not know War?  ³War, hhh, Wo-ooh-wo-ooh-wo-oh.  What is it good for?  Absolutely nothing. Good-God, you all.²
I got to stop that dancing in the street Œtill all hours.
I am sorry, but I have too much respect for women.
What?
Hey, don't worry.  Nothing's gonna happen to it.
The Feds?!
They put you in charge?
OK. Well...make us proud.  And be careful.
Yes I do. That's all I got. Guts and you, Johnson. There's no one else I can trust.
That's it! You can attack me, but when you attack my car, I cannot forgive! You in the back, girl!
You come highly recommended, Carter. And your particular assignment requires a special talent.
Sir, he's just gonna get in my way. If I'm gonna handle this situation...
You think this is funny, Carter?  You send for someone from Explosives!? Four men just died in there!
That's what you were supposed to be!
Don't play bullshit games with me.
Or somethin'.
Let me take you back inside, okay?
What?  You talked to him!  Did you tell him we dated before you were a priest?
What did he ask?
Weird.  Like after all those years you would remem--
Could your confess to Father Patrick from now on?
It's hurting.
"Never say die."
Someone reliable, I'm sure.  A booze- hound in a bar?
Or does she pick "NGB'S" -- "Nice Guys, But..."  Nice guys, but I'm cheap. Nice guys, but he lives with his mom... Nice guys, but he just out of prison.
Since when does Ellie need moral supp--
The real story on Miss Carpenter.
It wouldn't be a bad way to get you back into writing feature pieces again.
Okay, you were right.  I hated my column, but I can do this assignment.
Whoa, Ike.  Getting a complex, buddy?
Then you'll be my best man.
Splendid dissection of Maggie Carpenter, very professional job.
She's a cacophony of contradictions.
Ah, can't stay away from her, can you? Like a moth to a flame.
Are you a reporter?
That must have made you proud.
Betty Trout.  Five dollars.
Oh, yeah.  Scared the hell out of Skipper.
Yes.  Conviction.  Conviction that I'm onto the truth.  You're going to do the same thing to "poor bastard number four" that you did to the last three.  You're going to run again.  And I'm not leaving until you do.
Despite what you think, I don't do it on purpose.  And I have no intention of doing it again.
We think so.
You can turn that finger around.
Obviously, I'm not the only one who doesn't understand it.  The USS Maggie leaves quite a wake... Excuse me.
How do I do it?  I'm not that beautiful.
Because I think you're writing on spec and with a first person interview, you might actually sell that thing.
Seven-fifty.
Cindy the manicurist.
So?  Is that what you said to her?
And where you ever really going to run the leper colony in Molokai?
I kissed him back.
Me?
I wanted to talk to you about why I run or ride away from things.
She's the boss.
It's probably because you got him fired.
He looks better with that stuff out of his hair.  He's an attractive man.
No sauntering down the aisle.  Just make time.  Let's just get there.
I'm just finishing up, too.
No.
Is there somebody else?
That's good.
Houseboats don't go anywhere.
-- because Irene threatened to put the dog to sleep if he didn't --
I hope he doesn't get out his slides.
Today I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the earth.
Happy New Year.
Ever since Christmas, you've been different.  Kind of distracted, distant.  But I feel like you're coming back from wherever you were.
What?
It's just like my grandmother's china.
It was my mother's.
Walter, there's something I have to tell you --
At the top of the Empire State Building --
I think that's what I'm saying.
Yes.  Some people will do anything to get out of going to a symphony.
They knew it.  Time, distance, nothing could separate them. Because they knew.  It was right.  It was real.  It was...
"Dear Sleepless and Son..."
"I want to meet you..."
I know.
I always wondered about that too.
The kid is on.  You've got me listening to this garbage. Go on, turn it on.
I couldn't do it.  How did I get here?
Good night.
He said hello.
It's a sign I've watched this movie too many times.  I'm so stupid.  From the minute I listen to that stupid program on the radio, I've been a complete jerk.
Well, it's the same woman.  And he was crazy about her.  What is this?  This is from Seattle.
We're going to the Rainbow Room and the symphony tomorrow night.
I hate it.  I'm so happy, Becky.  Finally I feel happy.  This is right. This is real.  Everything else is what happens when you watch too many movies and completely lose sight of what counts.  Please don't tell anyone about what happened.  "Sleepless in Seattle" is history.
Do you want a matrimonial, past wives, any kids--
You want a tail.  I got a guy in Seattle --
I want my money.
It rains nine months of the year in Seattle.
Any time.
You'll love them.  We're going down to D.C.  tonight to be with them Christmas morning.
Magic.
Hi.  So far so good.  So.  What should we talk about? How insecure we were in high school.  Shirley Votypka, the first girl I ever felt up. Health.  What about health? Did you know that eating six macadamia nuts is the equivalent of eating a steak?
The point is, take the client out to dinner and ask her to marry you and then maybe we won't have to redo the kitchen cabinets.
Thanks, but I'll pass.  It's kind of a big night.  I don't like to leave Jonah alone.
What's she talking about?
I don't know.  When I met my wife, it was so clear.  I just <u>knew</u>.
And if I could describe it, it probably wouldn't be on a radio show.  But what the hell.  It's not one specific thing.  It's more of a feeling. 
It's not that late in Seattle.
I'm worried about him, he's worried about me, I ride my bike to school, he follows in the car, like I'm not supposed to know he's there.  Now it's Christmas, and you know what happens to people at Christmas.
Why not?
Tell her how you don't sleep at night.
What kind of person would write to someone they heard on the radio?
You think so?
Yeah.  What's that?
It's never happening again. Right?
It plays in 50 states.
What's the matter with this one? Wouldn't you like to have Imelda Marcos as your mother?
Jed is having a slumber party New Year's Eve and he invited me.
English muffin.  How do you do it?
It doesn't.  They ask you.
I know.
What was?
I don't know.
Oh, right.
She doesn't want us to go to Baltimore.  She wants to meet us in New York City on Valentine's Day.  On top of the Empire State Building.
There she is.
It's only ten o'clock.
I was thirsty.
Was Mom an adjustment?
I sincerely hope you are not going to marry Jessica.
This is the one I like.
I can't know what I said, but we're not going.
Sure.
Well...
It'll take him a while to come around.  A month ago he called one of those radio call-in shows and told them I needed a wife --
So whatdya say? I'll get the check, and I'll call you in eight months.
Why didn't you give a warning signal?
No thanks.
I've tried everything but shootin' 'em down.
Yeah.
You work alone, savvy? You can't handle the job, I'll find someone who can.
Hush... not a word about the cake, hear?
With Ramón it's ... pride. I spoke out of the bitterness in me. And he was hurt.
I listen to it. Every night. When you're out to the beer parlor.
What has it got me, your union?
I'm a fool.
I did forget. Luís told me.
They say I am no good to you.
Over my dead body.
She's the organizer's, wife. She's got to be there.
There's Jenkins' wife. You don't see her on no picket line.
I'm going back tomorrow.
No, no ... the Sheriff had enough of us. We drove him crazy.
We can't go on this way. I just can't go on living with you. Not this way.
And you know why? Because the company knows they can starve us out -- even if it takes another two, three months. What's it to them if the mine's shut down a little longer?
Charley Vidal says!  Don't throw Charley Vidal up to me!
Me, I'm a camp follower -- following this organizer from one mining camp to another -- Montana, Colorado, Idaho. But did he ever think to organize the women? No. Wives don't count in the Anglo locals either.
Too bad. The men've always wanted to get a look at the President.  But you've come out here to settle the strike?
She's coming. Charley Vidal gave her a lift.
I don't want you hanging around there, hear?
Don't I have enough troubles without them shipping you off to reform school?
You should have helped her without being asked.
You think my kids have enough to eat, you rat?
You think I was going to work you over? I wouldn't dirty my hands with you ...
What attitude?
Yeah? First door on the right. It ain't that dirty.  Just kinda' filthy is all.
Shhh.
Come on.  Ease off the girl.
Just make sure you come alone. This guy won't like any surprises
I don't know .... you could be staking your financial future on stealing Bob Hope's stool specimen.
Nothing.
Why? They don't hold him for more than a day or two.
What happened to your eye?
Like you?
You don't like the tune, find another station.
No. But I'm the only one with my sad story.  And that's how it's gonna stay.
I just can't. Okay?
They would have killed you too.
Never mind. Just do what I say. He holds out the baggie. Colette backs away.
Why?
Danny, it's not what you think.
I'm fine. Little nervous...little disappointed that I didn't finish this myself.
It's Tom.
It's not too late to show her you're sorry.
I hadn't noticed.  I've seen you around.  What's your name?
You on a roll?
Business.  I need to leave town and I find myself in dire need of some cash.
I find myself in dire need of some cash.
Not tonight.
You mean, like to throw 'em off?
Yes, Jimmy
Yes, Jimmy.
You're my best friend, man. I'd do anything for you.
Hey, check it out...
I'm not a tweaker.  I don't use drugs. I never had.
No, I'm good.
Secret recipe.
Hey, okay.
But you're a friend of Jimmy's. I think of you as a brother already.
Why do you say that?
Big Bill.
What?!
Please .. I don't know what you're ...
I'll keep that in mind.
You go, boy.
Hard to compare the people you're taking down with the Lord.
For that old possession charge? Gimme a break.
Yeah. Okay. Listen carefully ...  You're in the bathroom.  You've been shot in the shoulder ...
Cut to the fucking chase, Flynne.
Garcetti, you're teeth, they're fucking perfect.
What?!
I still don't know what you're talking about.
Who the hell is Jimmy?
They have. But they never found a lab.
Didn't you hear?  Domingo's dead.
And you've got wiener breath.
Hey, do you think you could eat me if you had to?  And if so, which part do you think you would find the most delicious?
Quit feeling sorry for yourself, Tom. It gets old.
Why are you doing this?
Yeah.  This could be the one we're looking for.
Now that's scary!
No, you can't taste it.  It's the fucking lab! Now shut up.
Where are your men now?
He's the last of four brothers, the other three were killed in action. This is straight from the Chief of Staff.
The numbers don't make sense, sir. His brothers are dead, that's too bad, but they're out of the equation. Sending men up there is bleeding heart crapola from three thousand miles away.  One private is simply not worth a squad.  Colonel anderson This one is.  He's worth a lot more than that.  Which is why I'm sending you, you're the best field officer there is.
Thank you, sir.
What about the Captain?  Where's he from?
Looks like a flaming asshole to me.
Of course, sir.
What deal?
That's not all.  There were nine gunners on the eighty-eights, one had a broken heel on his boot, two had bratwurst for supper last night, one of them is named Fritz, the other, Hans, maybe, I don't know, it's hard to tell.
On the other side of the street, crouches in a doorway with Jackson. Upham is a bit in shock, less from the nearness of the bullets than from what Miller just did for him.
It was nothing.
I don't expect to live that long.
Same place we are.
Sure, you got one?
Some private up there lost three brothers, got a ticket home.
What about Talbot?
PUSH!
Tell that to Private James Ryan. We've got our orders.  Let's go.
Maybe.
Now you're the one kidding yourself.  Hell of  a mission.
It doesn't take this.
Let's just find someplace.
Vecchio.
We're going to hope like hell the tanks were on their way somewhere else.
Stay at it until you get fire control.  Keep 'em down, wait for the navy.
But, sir...
Stands on the edge of the woods, almost in a trance.
Upham, are you sure you've never been in combat?
I don't like that one.
Has anyone ever told you, you're officer material?
Looks like tea time, maybe they're Brits.
What if our guys open up, sir?
FIRES a burst.  More Germans drop.
Knows what that means.  He hears the RUMBLE OF THE TANKS.
Yeah, yeah.  I want you right next to me, no matter where I go, you understand?
Alright, come with me.
Captain, he's fast!
Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn it...
Since I was nine years old.  They got a lot of explosives around mines. Me and my little brother could get into any warehouse you ever saw. Damn, we had fun!
Twenty-four-five.
We believe that your father operates in a large pool of cash that comes from phoney billings, phoney patients.  We've been investigating him for five years.  We believe that when they die, he takes their money.
So you refuse to answer my questions?
Mr Court, be aware that we will be contacting a number of your business associates...
And your former wife.
What family?  We never heard from them.  I sold her house for them, made them money.
Is it a gift for your wife?  Are you getting a set together? 
Lloyd, honey, just come home, okay?
The movies are a good second date, you know, as a date?
Yes I did- I sat across from her in a mall.  We ate together.  We ate, that's eating, sharing an important physical event.
Lloyd.
See you tomorrow.
Come on, it's graduation.
Diane Court does not realise how good-looking she is.
He's got that nervous talking thing.  I told him not to speak.
Look at his face, he did the deed.
I dream about it.
He'd like to start serving immediately.
Confirm this with my office and my client.
I'm going to take out Diane Court again.
I'm not going back there.  I don't even know who you're talking about.
Ha!  Go back!  What a great line!
Oh yeah!
Okay.
Well, since I'm not only your father, I'm also your friend; I had to get you two presents.
Everybody thinks I'm a priss.
I love you dad.
We'll worry about that later.  Now come on, tell me that you're special.
Lloyd was such a gentleman.  He was funny and nervous and strange, and I met people that I never would have met before, then I blew it.  I called him basic.  Can you believe I did that?
Goodnight.
And then you got up and you told them to turn the plane around.
Dad, I'm sorry.
You're going.
Well then don't pick it up. You know what's best.
Swear to god.
But I found the money.
No, but you stole from them.
I trusted you.  I stood up in court five years ago and I picked you.
If we could just talk about boys everything would be so much easier.  You know, your room is always ready for you, you can always come home if... alright, what do you want me to do?
Okay.  Oh, here's Ray.  Just talk to him because when you don't, your mouth turns down.
Look at those eyes.
Yeah.  What a day.
No tips.  I won't give you any tips of any kind.
You will?  Excellent, alright, this is great.  You will, really?
Goodbye.
They're Bavarian Death style  pretzels.
Bye.
That's cool then.
Well, my parents split up when I was thirteen, and... god, I actually had to... I went into court and I had to choose between the two of them.  So I chose my dad.  It just felt safer that way, you know?
So am I. I want to see you again.  I want to see you as much as I can before you leave.  I said it.
You think so?
Come on.
I just can't have any social life right now.
Friends with potential.
Yeah?
Oh.  I was putting the...
This is so noble.
Then why are you shaking?
I know.  Lloyd, let's not start putting things on this level.
You need to study?
Okay, how much time do you need?  I mean, you know, I mean you'll be leaving in a little while, so that's answered some questions. 
No.  We decided that we're friends.  I mean, I know it's a terrible word...
Don't be mean, this is hard for me too.
Man, you never had a chance with a girl like that.
Hello.  May I please speak with Diane please?
No.
Uh, no, not really, no actually, basically, you don't know me. I'm a friend of your daughters; well I sat with her yesterday at the mall.
Oh.  Okay then... Lloyd Dobler, 555-1342.
Okay.  Good afternoon.  Goodbye.
Very talented.
I'm incarcerated, Lloyd!  I don't deserve to lose my daughter over this.  I don't deserve to have you as my go-between.  And I can't for the life of me figure out how she could choose to champion in mediocrity the way she flirts around you.
I know this part, keep reading.
Just knowing a person like that exists, knowing that for a minute that she felt that and wrote 'I still can't help loving you'. That's gotta be a good thing, right?  That's gotta be a good thing.
So what's up?
How ya doin' Miss Evans?
I called her up.
You know Diane Court?
A very responsible young man you're out with tonight.
Thanks a lot Lloyd.
I love you too.
Sir, the list is correct.
My plant manager is somewhere on this train. If it leaves with him on it, it'll disrupt production and the Armaments Board will want to know why.
It's up to you.
I'd love to, it'll have to wait until I get back.  I have to leave.
Some of the boys went crazy, what're you going to do?  You're right, it's bad business, but it's over with, it's done.  Occasionally, sure, okay, you got to make an example.  But that's good business.
Yeah, what's that?
True.
I pay you too much.
He's important to my business.
I just told you.
Yeah, I can.
Nice things cost money.
How should I know?  It's broken. See what you can do.
We're losing the war, aren't we.
No, look.  It's the others.  They're the ones causing these delays.
Jews can no longer own businesses, sir, that's why this one's for sale.
Thank you.
Are you losing money?
You don't?  I do.  I see a difference.
No, no, what, what is it?
I lost a day of production.  I lost a worker.  I expect to be compensated.
He was a metal press operator, quite skilled.
I won't.
It's hell week. Chill. The movie murders have brought out the crazies. It's nothing.
Stop it...
Someone who wants to talk to you.
What if I said you?
I'll go. I don't mind. Really.
What?
It’s over, Cotton.
Did you do it?
What are you doing here? I thought you had retired from field reporting?
Should we be worried about this guy? Isn't it kinda weird he just showed up and now people are dying?
Not one bit.
She dumped me.
I skipped. Too many "That's her" looks.
The forbidden subject.
Let us decide that.
No, it's not.
Damned if I know. She ditched me.
What guy?
Yeah, how can we help? Do you have any questions regarding the sequel of your life?
I really don’t like that comparison, honey.
I find his work overwrought.
You’d me amazed at how many of us there are out there. It’s a whole world, Sid. You’re really popular amongst the demented.
And we didn’t want to do that, Sid. We wanted to give you your money’s worth.
Miss Weathers.
I see you read the book.
And an explanation is, of course, out of the question.
Can we turn the light on?
Dewey, you and I would never make it.
..and as lonely as I am...
Let's find out.
No, wait here.
They thought it was a publicity stunt.
They don't know. It was carefully planned. Earlier in the day the victims received anonymous passes to the movie.
No. I will not crawl under a rock. This is a fucked-up world and people kill people all the time. I'll just get used to it.
Dewey, there's no such place.
I'll give you one guess.
You're pretty when you're angry.
I'm okay. PEOPLE magazine won't stop calling but other than that...
But who would operate your camera?
I got. I got it. FRIDAY THE 13TH, PART 20.
Is Sid in therapy?
I'd really just like to be alone.
Is that cool? Just to leave her like that?
Her old boyfriend?
You're not allowed to ask that.
Thanks, Joel.
..we only promote safe rubbered sex.
Gee, let me think. "Do you want to..." Is that the best you can do? Some tired hand me down rehash? Hey, pal, no one's gonna write a book about you. No movie rights. Nothing. I've been through this before and much better I might add.
It'll be okay, baby, I'll hold your hand.
We got free tickets.
He's after me.
I'm sorry, Sid, please. I never should have gone along with Gale. I know I'm stupid. I wish I had some good reason to give you but I'm just stupid. Please, Sid, don't be mad at me.
I have this button I press. See? It insulates me. She mimes an air lock valve.
Do I?
But your voice sounds so familiar.
Good bye Ben.
To see your reaction.
I go to the police station and do my job, and you go back to being Gale Weathers.
Ben Damon. Christine Perkins. Sarah Darling. Tom Prinze. That's four, last time I learned how to count.
Call me Mark, would you?  Cause I'm gonna keep calling you Sidney.
Understood.  If you'll excuse me Detective.  Gale.
That is for me to decide.  I need to talk to her Mr. Riley, she is a key element in this case.  I have a press conference in an hour, and I need to explain why there are four dead celebrities.
What does this have to do with Sid?
He could've monitored the calls on a scanner. Did you call her from the set?
I'm out back. Tied up. Hurry Sid! The killer's looking for you! Quick untie me!
They've got her!
He wasn't superhuman Dewey. He wasn't superhuman at all.
This has everything to do with me Dewey. I was the one who brought the nation's attention to this shit anyway. I'll be damned if I'm gonna sit around and pass on the buck again.
All of what Dewey?  You do know something, don't you?
Jennifer?! Wait, where are you going off to?
Do you want us to come with you?
Nevermind, what'd you two find?
Just what the hell do you people think you're doing, barging in here like this? I've got important calls to make. I run this studio.
Well if you were in my shoes, dealing with those big Time Sunrise Studio producers like I do on a daily basis, you'd watch how quick your life goes from a Walt Disney picture to a Tobe Hooper flick.
There a story in that building?
Settle down Beavis.  Why don't you tell us the truth?
GALE WEATHERS?! What are you doing here? No press on the set!  No press, no press on set! Get that woman out of here.
They're the ones who approved it.
Who?
Tom Prinze, tanked as usual. That's a shocker.
You mean what's left of us.  Yeah I'm running on empty anyways. Gotta refuel.
Hi, Gale. I'm glad you're all right.
All the nightmares. All the hell I went through was because of you, you spineless bastard!
Wait a second Sid. Don't you go jumping the gun. You haven't seen the best part.  With the aides of the computer revolution of y2kI've been able to steal your voice.  Ain't it cool? Listen to what the police are gonna find next to your lifeless, mutilated body.
Roman knock it off! Do you people even know why you kill people? You kill people cause you choose to and not because of any other fucking reason!
What character?  I'm Candy, the chick who gets killed second.  I'm only in two scenes!
I'm hanging up right now.
Make-up. You need it.  Hey, Roman isn't here?
Damn. He called my roommate and told her he had some important things he wanted to go over with me in his office tonight.
Who the fuck is this?
It's called tact, you fuckrag.
So you gonna try and make up with Sid?
It's an easy game. We ask you a question. If you get it wrong -- you die.
Except for me and Billy... we were left for dead...
Everyone dies but us. We get to carry on and plan the sequel. Let's face it, these days -- you gotta have a sequel.
No, it's not.
She looked dead. Still does.
No, I didn't. I didn't kill anyone, Sheriff.
I'm sorry. Don't hate me.
See, it couldn't have been me. I was in jail, remember?
So... I'm sorry. I've been a selfish shit and I'm sorry.
Are you serious?
I called my dad.
You don't still think it was me?
Fuck you.
Are you alone in the house?
Really? What?
What's your favorite scary movie?
Freddy -- that's right. I liked that movie. It was scary.
I want to now who I'm talking to.
More of a game, really.
TO SEE WHAT YOUR INSIDES LOOK LIKE.
I thought you didn't have a boyfriend.
No...
Turn off the light.
I'll even give you a warm up question.
Name the killer in HALLOWEEN.
I can't think.
Name the killer in FRIDAY THE 13TH.
What?
I know who you are, ma'am. How's the eye?
Well... uh... yes ma'am. For the time being.
You're not supposed to be here, ma'am.
Twenty-five, huh? In a demographic study I proved to be most popular amongst males, 11-24. I just missed you. Of course, you don't look a day over twelve, except in the upper torso area. Does the force require that you work out?
I'd love to. If you're sure it's alright?
Hold up a sec...
...yeah...
You're sure it was the Hilton?
We'll find him, Sid. Don't worry.
And my Dad? Any word on him?
Thanks, Dewey. But with my luck they'd cast Tori Spelling.
How is she?
Twenty years ago I woulda said not a chance. But these kids today... damn if I know.
Have you contacted the bureau?
She's with my sister. Should I bring her in?
I told you to send it back.
The phone's dead.
It'll be out later this year.
Your mother's murder was last year's hottest court case. Somebody was gonna write a book about it.
During the trial, you did all those stories about me. You called me a liar.
Why would she lie about it?
Please, it's common knowledge. Her mother was a trollop.
And it fucked her up royally. Think about it. It makes perfect sense. Her mom's death leaves her distraught and hostile at a cruel and inhumane world, she's disillusioned, where's God, etc. Completely suicidal. And one day she snaps. She wants to kill herself but realizes teen suicide is out this year. And homicide is a much healthier therapeutic expression.
Scary night, isn't it? With the murders and all, it's like right out of a horror movie or something.
And why is that?
Hello Sidney.
Who are you?
Twice.
Listen to me, Sid. I found Tatum. She's dead, she's been killed... I think Stu did it.
Yeah, Casey and Steve were completely hollowed out. Takes a man to do something like that.
What are you saying? That I killed her or something?
Yeah, I'm off early -- curfew you know.  Now that's poor taste.
The why'd the police let him go?
Could be. Now that Billy's tried to mutilate her, you think Sid would go out with me?
Because he's probably dead. His body will come popping out in the last reel somewhere... eyes gauged. See, the police are always off track with this shit, if they'd watch PROM NIGHT they'd save time. There's formula to it. A very simple one. Everyone's always a suspect -- the father, the principal, the town derelict...
Don't listen to him. It's him. He's the one.
No, Sid.
Hey, Stu? Didn't you use to date Casey?
What happened?
How do you gut someone?
Just a sec... I need to talk to someone.
I don't know...
If they were having an affair how come that Cotton couldn't prove it in court?
Come on, let's rock.
Billy and his penis don't deserve you.
Watch the show, Sid. His basket is bigger than the one you're pushing.
Oh, Sidney. WHAT? A guy can talk tits til he's dead but the minute you mention an eight inch weenie. Watch out.
I did. He's full of shit.
Give it to me.
Announcing what?
Everything else was taken as close to conclusion as humanly possible.  Also... this shouldn't be his first assignment.
I thought you might want to be filled in.
I heard.
It's always been like this.
Where was the girl?
Hello.
I mean, at this point, what would it hurt if you told us a little about yourself?
It's not too far away now.
David... please...
NO!
You only killed a bunch of innocent people so you could get your rocks off.  That's all.
Delusions of grandeur.
We would have gotten you eventually.
What the fuck is going on here?!
I meant to ask you something, Mills, when we spoke on the phone.  I can't help wondering... why here?
I realize that.
What?
Is there any blood in it?
Guessing at this point is useless.
Okay... sure...  It's just that, with my old partner, you know...
Whoa, whoa... what?!
Tonight.
Hello.
What about sports?
Punishing.
It's got to be.
I've seen the same.  I'm not the country hick you seem to think I am.
Sounds like he knew what he was talking about.
No kidding!  No fucking kidding!
This is the job.  It's not an Easter egg hunt.
It's too dismissive to call him a lunatic. We can't make that mistake.
It's a fine line between insane and inspired.
What does all that matter anyway?  It's not our job to figure him out, is it?  All we have to do is catching him.
Yeah, well... at least we're out of the office.  We've got pizza.
We're focusing.
That is.
That's what it says.  Jonathan Doe.
We'll take a look at him.  Talk to him.
Think it through.  If we leave a hole like this, we'll never prosecute.  He'll walk.  We have to come up with some excuse for knocking on this door.
Then, he must write about these murders.
How can you say that?  Especially after today?
You're the oldest man I know, Somerset.
You follow the law and do the best you can. It's all there.
Why don't you shut the fuck up for a while? You bitch and complain... if I thought like you, I would have slit my wrist already.
Well, I have to tell you...  I think I've fallen in love with you.
What are you talking about?  What happened?
What did you say?
I don't see anything.
Too long.  What do you think so far?
I hate this city.
I want to have children.  It's just...
Did the wife confess?
This is a done deal.  All but the paperwork.
How should I know?
You fit a lot of descriptions.
Yes, sir...Troop's about ten miles back...The Colonel sent me looking for you...
God forbid...No, son, you flog on back and tell your pa where we're at...and where he's at...
All right...But keep your eye on me, boy...I'm the hard case you're up against here -- not these childish savages...If you don't hear me first time I holler, you better read my mind...I don't aim to raise no two hollers on any subject at hand...
We ain't goin'! We ain't goin' without you, Debbie...Ethan, get the horses...I'll try to keep her talkin'...
They have done...nothing...They are my people...
Where's Scar, Mose...SCAR?
You said there'd be a thousand dollar reward.
You got it with you?
Scar's band was headin' north...to winter in at Fort Wingate...eatin' agency beef. That's what this buck said...Maybe he lied.
Don't have to call me 'sir' neither... Nor grampaw neither...Nor Methuselah neither...I can whup you to a frazzle.
Name's Ethan...Now what's so mighty fishy about this trail?
An Injun will chase a thing til he thinks he's chased it enough...Then he quits...Same when he runs...Seems he never learns there's such a thing as a critter that might just keep comin' on...So we'll find them in the end, I promise you that...We'll find them just as sure as the turning of the earth.
I always felt like she was...Her folks takin' me in, raisin' me like one of their own...
Oh...
He just couldn't wait...
Look?
Nine...  Ten!
What'd the soldiers have to kill her for!..
Not likely.
They're not white any more -- they're <U>Comanche</U>!...Let's see the bodies...
I am...I am...It's just that I know Martha'd want you to think of her boys as well as her girls...And if the girls are...dead...Ethan, don't let the boys waste their lives in vengeance!
No...not yet...
From the beginning...
That means Mister Futterman is dead, by golly.
I can't help it, Laurie...I just gotta catch up with Ethan...
You'll have to wait until we reach the agency...Fall in behind the column...
"With you, my life began and with you shall it end..."
Oh God, Tommi...
They say it's fantastic.  At least that's what I read in a men's magazine.  So who are the two lucky ones?
Oh, damnit!
My father was a pilot.  And do I know how to fly?
So do I, believe me.
Come on, at least try one.  It took me two hours to make these.
Yeah... I have to go to town.
Why not?  She can guard the house. By the way, I gave her a name: Clara.
Oh, baloney.  You should just hear yourself talk!
An animal?  What kind of animal? A goddamned T-Rex, or what?
Thank you.
It's a pleasure.  You're from the city, right?
1976.  What happened back then?
Tenth floor.
Romeo and Juliet--just a suggestion.
Right you are, governor!
Sir Robert De Lesseps.
Lady?
You have the money?
Then tomorrow you will have the pages.
Romeo. Wit, swordsman, lover.
Aye, now and again, but what of it? I have lost my gift.
I have lost my gift.  It's as if my quill is broken. As if the organ of the imagination has dried up. As if the proud tower of my genius has collapsed.
The woman who wears the snake will dream of you, and your gift will return. Words will flow like a river. I will see you in a week.
And his ears.
Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter.
Without doubt he is completing it at this very moment.
Yes, but very well.
Henslowe, you pound of tripe, in my business I would be out of business if I had your courage, so don't tell me about business
Nobody knew!
As soon as I have found my muse
She is always Aphrodite.
Half what you owed me. I am still due for One Gentleman of Verona.
Fifty pounds? What for?
Cut out my heart! Throw my liver to the dogs!
To the Palace at Whitehall.
Yes. Nearly.  It's all locked safe in here. We need Ralph for the Pirate King. Good morning, Master Nol. You will have a nice little part.
I did not.
What? Who?
No, it will turn out well.
I don't know, it's a mystery.
I am not so well-born.
From tomorrow, away in the country for three weeks! Is Master Shakespeare not handsome?
Oh, but they can!
There was a wager, I remember…as to whether a play can show the very truth and nature of love. I think you lost it today.  You are an eager boy. Did you like the play?
"Madam!"
Sam! Do me a speech, do me a line.
My plantations in Virginia are not mortgaged for a nutmeg. I have an ancient name that will bring you preferment when your grandson is a Wessex. Is she fertile?
Is she obedient?
I like her.
You have opened the playhouses?
I have to get back.
If they find you here they will kill you.
Oh, not for the world!
Answer me only this: are you the author of the plays of William Shakespeare?
Well perhaps better than my first. 
Oh, but it will end well for love?
Stage fighting!  Oh, Will! As Thomas Kent my heart belongs to you but as Viola the river divides us, and I will marry Wessex a week from Saturday.
My love is no lie. I have a wife, yes, and I cannot marry the daughter of Sir Robert de Lesseps. It needed no wife come from Stratford to tell you that. And yet you let me come to your bed.
You flatter, my lord.
Do you intend to marry, my lord?
Ah! My lady! The tide waits for no man, but I swear it would wait for you!
Lady Viola is…young in the world. Your Majesty is wise in it. Nature and truth are the very enemies of playacting. I'll wager my fortune.
It is to be expected on a Sunday.
Killed last night, in a tavern! Come, then, we'll say a prayer for his soul
I . . .
It is only ours you can know.
Does she say so?
Constantly. Without doubt. And plays the lute, she has a natural ear. And her bosom--did I mention her bosom?
By coveting my property. I cannot shed blood in her house but I will cut your throat anon. You have a name?
On a more fortuitous occasion, perhaps
A man, my lord?
A theatre poet?
Marlowe? Oh yes, he is the one, lovely waistcoat, shame about the poetry.
I don't know -- Campbell or something?
Serve.
I don't have time.
Have you seen him?
I'm only asking you both to think about it.
You call them if you want.
Do I? What? What? What are you talking about?
We all are, David, we're all going to do it. Each of us, you, me and Juliet, will do his or her bit. Is that fair enough?
Can we talk about something?
I want to talk now.
You think so?
There was a break-in.
What's wrong?
They know? So what? They have nothing, there is nothing, to connect us to that bodies stuff.
That's because he is. Does that upset you?
Well, then?
Take another look at these two.
What?
Oh, no problems. Don't worry.
Tell you what. If you do remember seeing any of these guys, maybe you could give me a phone, on this number, any time you like.
Well, yes.
Now, let me get this straight. This affair that you're not having, is it not with a man or not with a woman?
For the flat.
What? Oh, yeah, sure, if you want. I tell you, every letter this guy writes to you is the same: they all begin like pure love and descend into open pornography. I dream of your thighs, the soft touch of your white skin leading me in desire, while I, aroused and inflamed --'
Alex.
Not usually this drunk.
You're right.
Alex, how shouldI know? I'm just a girl.
Who?
It tastes different.
He's right. You'd feel much better about it.
Yeah, he's got to go to work, hasn't he? You think he'll come down for that?
And the money?
Forget it -- he'll come down.
Well, I'm not expecting anyone either.
It's the only way.
I'll wait there.
Everything.
What?
You mean I can have the room?
What about?
Who said there were four?
Yes. Why do you think you woke and they didn't?
Keep it going, Alex. You're unstoppable now.
You paid two hundred pounds for this?
And you need your sleep.
Oh, don't be so coy, dear. You're going to Rio.
It wasn't like that.
Not any real sneering as such, no.
The telephone? It continues to ring.
A certain weakness.
You know about it?
Yes, the first one's fine. Heathrow direct.
Do you think you have a good memory for faces?
And you said you supposed so, but I wasn't offering it for debate.
Excellent. DC Mitchell is a rising star, Mr. Stevens. Under my tutelage he will undoubtedly make the grade.
Is it real?
Yeah, baby, how's it going?
Well, it's a small town. Sooner or later things catch up with you... don't they?
That you were just indulging me.
No.
So what are you doing going over there? You're not her doctor.
But you don't know what happened.
I don't want to place you in any position --
Jesus, I don't know, baby, I been cutting too much hair lately. I'm losing all my concepts...
Yes.
No, that's okay, I'll do It now.
Well she...
She's a friend of Jill's.
Her?
No thanks.
No thanks.
Yeah.
Have you ever made it with a girl?
Am I what?
Don't make conversation with me.
You don't have to make conversation with me, I'm not my mother... do you have a thing about older women... that's sort of faggoty isn't it?
I never get my hair done.
You think that's funny, don't you?
Then what do you think?
I am not!
Right, that's right.
Well, yeah... you know.
They are?
I've got heads here, Norman.
Look, Norman, I'm not the shampoo girl.
I'd cut it...
Whew.
Jackie, would you argue with your doctor.
And what?
I just have to do one little thing.
You did, I know you did.
What about it?
That son of a bitch, everything he says is a phony piece of shit, what does he think, I'm some cigar butt he's got between his teeth --
Fuckin' A --
You were great.
-- look, you don't have to entertain me...
-- well, if you feel like playing, go play...
Don't go, Jackie...
You were supposed to handle that bitch, she's always asking for you, and she was furious you weren't here.
She's murdered her hair... you do something with her, I'm never going to touch her again.
-- oh -- sweetheart...
-- how did you get here?
What're you talking about?
Who?
We live together now.
-- Sure.
I'm around you and I like you, don't I?
Okay, baby. Okay...
Baby, I'm in the middle of work.
Just a second, I'll be right with you...
I'll call you.
Nothing, I'll call you, okay?
Wait a minute, God-damn-it. Do you think I want to go to some God damned party? I'm trying to get that God damned shop open. I'm trying to get a little bread together. That's all I'm doing.
Maybe I should get a dog... no, it would just shit all over the house and I'd never clean it up.
I don't want to fight either. Look... uh -- I love you.
I do, Jill.
I didn't want him meeting me here.
I'm very tired, George.
Let go of me.
Well, did you get a job out of it at least?
Where did this come from?
I just want to know, that's all.
I don't want to be a fool!... I want to look them in the eye and say, I know!
-- no, it'll help me, really --
Did you?
Did you?
What did you say?
But Mr. Norman said --
Well, yeah.
In a way. But...
They're not?
You're right.
Oh yeah?
That's okay, that's okay, just shut the door.
What about, tonight?
... this doing hair it's...
Oh, hey...
But...
No thanks.
I don't either, Lester, I swear to you I don't.
Yes I do.
I... uh... I... uh... can't.
Yeah.
What do you mean?
Yeah, yeah -- 'bye.
A soap?
And?
What was it, somebody's daughter?
That's very sweet of you, Mr. Roth.
-- well, more than anything else --  -- I'd like to suck his cock.
How did you lose that key? Oh, George, this is uh Miss -- this is Jackie.
Steve?
Just a second, I've gotta clean this mess up or the dogs'll have it all over the house.
Oh, dear that's too bad.  -- get her out of here, get her out of here.
I have to meet a client... who're you dating?
Oh, honey, don't be totally naive.
No, listen. He's a very good hairdresser.
George is great but I know what you mean.
I don't know. One minute he's up in the air and makes love to me five times a day and tells me everything's going to be great and he's getting his own shop and then suddenly he disappears and he won't even talk to me. It's driving me crazy.
Well, there was this one time --
-- Well it was very hot so I'd left the door open and the water was running so I didn't hear him come down the stairs...
What did you do?
That's right.
Now I'm embarrassed to tell you.
-- sort of a boyfriend?
I don't think so.
You mean when are you going to Egypt?
Two weeks from tomorrow.
Those Arabs won't be when they start chasing you around the sand dunes.
Jill.
-- just wonderful.
No, it's not that...
No.
No.
John...
Have they sat down?
Well you should have eaten your breakfast.
Come here for a minute, first.
Do you feel bad?
What do you mean?
I'm not supposed to.
Now think real hard, Doc.  Think.
Well, maybe things that happened... leave other kinds of traces behind.
Do you really want to go and live in that hotel for the winter?
Okay...oh!
Red Rum.  Red Rum.  Red Rum.
Are you having a bad dream?
Red Rum.  Red Rum.  Red Rum.  Red Rum.
Yes.
No.  It's the little boy that lives in my mouth.
Where does he go?
Ah he dislocated his shoulder.
Great.  Sit down.  Oh these marvellous doughnuts, help yourself. Coffee will be ready in a few minutes.
That's right, sir.
Eh... Mr. Grady... weren't you once the caretaker here?
Thank you very much.  I'll do that.
Sure.
It will be a pleasure.  Right this way Mrs. Torrance.
No problem, Mr. Ullman.  I was just getting to the ice cream.
Nice to meet you.
I wouldn't know what to do with it if I did.
Doc.  You called Danny 'Doc' twice just now.
Pleased to meet you.
It's good to be back, Lloyd.
Your money's no good here.
Uh...huh.
Which room was it?
No, nothing at all.
Absolutely nothing.  How is he?
I think he did it to himself.
You think maybe he should be taken to a doctor?
Jack...
Why?
Darling, light of my life, I'm not going to hurt you.  You didn't let me finish my sentence.  I said 'I'm not going to hurt you... I'm just going to bash your brains in!'  I'm going to bash them right the fuck in.
Put the bat down, Wendy.
Go away from me.
Go away.
Wendy...
Well, if you are going to have some, I wouldn't mind.  Thanks.
Hi.
Blue. This blue.
It was Brady's idea, Jane. Honest to God. Please take the money. I want to make up.
All except my legs... I don't think I can walk.
Uncle Al, what if it's not a guy?
A bunch of men getting ready to pretend they're Clint Eastwood... Marty, didn't anybody ever tell you that the only monsters are in comic books and drive-in movies?
I'll give you the telephone numbers of my ex-wives, dear boy- they'll be interested to hear that.
But you are, you know- you are my dear boy.
She and dad are out back lighting the barbecue. Jane's walking around like she's King Shit of Turd Mountain. Like always.
Sure.
You want to know what I think?
And what do you suggest I do about it, dear boy?
Yeah.  Sister Mary Pat was discussing it.  You know she thinks it's a sin.
What you say?
BY A VOICE YOU HEAR FROM ON HIGH
LET THY SOUL BE HEALED
Were you tempted?
SING!
SING!
You ain't got nothin' I ain't seen.
You want me to go against a priest?  Get excommunicated?  You think I'm nuts?
You lying sleazeball!  The best years of my life!  What am I, garbage?  Am I lint?
That used to be true, Vince.  I was with you.  But something happened.  And I'm different now.  Real--different.  I've had, well, you might call it -- a religious experience.  And I've got just two words for you.  And those two words are...
Oh-huh.
Right.
The Dixie Cups?  Oh my.  I was just a girl.  Of course.  SPRING IS HERE THE SUN WILL SHINE
Get moving.  I'm right behind you.
It's true -- I know her.
What a shame!
Pay attention...
Were you wicked?
Um, I don't really know this one...
Well... see, at my old convent, I wasn't always... real popular.  I was sort of selfish and... not real helpful.  Okay, I'll say it -- I wasn't much of a nun. But now, thanks to all of you... maybe I'm shaping up.
That's true, wouldn't that be great.  Of course, we never know when things are going to change.  Any one of us could be transferred to another convent, tomorrow.
What?  What time is it?
Right, sure, but what's the problem? Are they keeping you a prisoner here? Do they drug you?  Did Reverend Mother like, kidnap your parents?  We can call the Enquirer.
Honey.
Keep moving!
Now stop that.  You didn't shoot at me. You were only trying to help, to give me experience.  I tried to explain that to Reverend Mother, but -- I don't know if she understood.
Give me a C.  A C!
HONOR THY MOTHER AND THY FATHER TOO DON'T KILL, DON'T STEAL, IT'S BAD FOR YOU
Oh no.  We'll always be together.
What is your full name?  Your Christian name?
I was expelled!  When I was fifteen?
Before we do, you might like to freshen up.  And you'll certainly want to change
Can do.
A what?
Useless distractions.
And whom would you call?
Your cell is more than adequate.
Have you been out in those streets?  Do you know what those kids are up against? You should help them!
Do your recall the words of Saint Peter, in Ecciesiastes 1:27?  He spoke unto a wastrel youth.  He said, "Take up thy task, and know ye the path of contentment."
Good.  Mary Patrick, I need you in the office.  Mary Clarence, carry on.
I don't believe we have anything to say to each other.
I know!  I'm sorry   I didn't mean for it to happen!  And I was the one they were shooting at!
I am?
What?
Out of the question.
Of course.  Mary Clarence, a convent is not a totalitarian state.  Most major decisions are made by the membership as a whole.  A membership that, I am certain, will vote in a rational and pious manner. All those in favor of allowing Mary Clarence to select a program?
Really.  Well, that makes two of us.
Okay, so I just got things started.  But you could build on that.  You could keep it going.
At least he's not a cop.  At least he can afford a decent gift.
You couldn't believe it?  Vince the Prince?
You'd lose.  You'd die.  All over the sidewalk.  And into the street.
Maybe Hawaii.
Safest place in the world.  You think Vince would look for you here?
But Vince has contacts all over the place!  This is San Francisco!  They'll be looking for me!
You blew it -- big time.  She doesn't want you back.
You're gonna be singing for St. Peter if you don't get your ass out of here!
I think they'd understand.
You don't get it!  It's a big thing for them, it's like... Caesar's Palace. Prime-time.  They're singing for the Cardinals.  It's like... "Star Search." If first prize was a trip to the Vatican. They've worked really hard, they deserve this.
Even nuns have to pee.
Hail, Mary.
We didn't tell you what?
She's a broad!  Got it!  Just some broad!
No smart-ass remarks or nothing.
Neither did you!
That's what I figured, too.
And then we can ice her.  No nun, no evil eye.
She's praying.
Is it worth it?  A lot of witnesses here.
And therefore an ideal prospect for rehabilitation.
And you'll face that danger head-on.  As if I could stop you.  And you have my complete support in this matter. Anything you can do to revitalize this neighborhood would be a blessing.
It's that call you were expecting, Vince.
Well, unless your name is Baltus, you should not worry over mine.
Two days... ?  For murder?
To place it inside its coffin.
What?
Protest to my superiors if you like.
They need guidance.
I have everything... last testaments... birth certificates, death certificates... deeds.
I could determine if he were dead <u>before</u> he went into the Hudson.
And, <u>with</u> disrespect, Constable, if jails and courts overflow, it is testimony to success, not failure.
Even though I have seen confessions pried from the lips of the accused, often quite literally?
Van Ripper and his wife agreed to take him.  They have children and a good home and good land.
Is that all you say?  Look at her.
He would not have gone into the Western Woods.  No sane man would.
I know it.
I did not ask you to, did I?
Up.
Now, hold the bowl steady.  Back to business.
Listen.
Should we go back?
Business, best hidden is hidden best at night.
Baltus Van Tassel.
Feel free to form your own opinion.  Though it appears you already have.
Excuse me... I should apologize.  I, um... I... have no great love of...
The massive fellow... Brom.  For someone you call "friend," he misplaces a good portion of jealousy.
There is no such thing as magic.
You made this, and the drawings?
If you want.  But...
You are not regarding it in full. The Widow Windsor had been run through by a sword.  I followed the bloodless wound, a wound whose path I could not comprehend till I had seen the Horseman with my own eyes.
If you want me to go, I will.  Do you want me to leave?
A woman should not be out alone in these woods.
What did you say?
I'm drawing bad blood from the wound.
And, what did he say?
Keep climbing.  I will follow...
Do you know... I think those are the first words I have heard from you my entire time here.
What did you say?
Close your mouth!  Keep silent.
May I see my mother?
No, sir, please... she is innocent...
Now it's minimal wage and there ain't nothin' but a army cot and a toilet back there.
If it works out and all, maybe we'll get you a key so you can get out at night if you need to. See you later.
You got any money?
I fixed it. Hit's a workin' pretty good.
No, don't guess I do.  Scooter, good to meet you.  This is him, the one I talked to you about on the phone. Now like I said, I'll understand if you get nervous about it. I'm not gonna lie to you now, he did get in that trouble but then he was real young.
Well, I've got a roomful of work for him to do. Can't get Scooter to do any of it.
How are you, Bill?
French-fried potaters.
Ain't that the sweetest thing. What am I supposed to do about supper with you traipsin' around with that fag?
Boy, ain't you somethin' else. Talkin' back and everything. It kinda makes me horny when you talk back.
Karl, you better clap your hands or he'll just keep on.
This is not your house, Doyle. This is my house and I'll say who stays and goes. You've got a house, why don't you go get one of your girlfriends and go home to it.
You might want to find out. He might of hacked his family to pieces with a hatchet or somethin'.
You be quiet, Frank, we're talkin'. The adults are talkin'. Were you in the lockup for cuttin' somebody up with a hatchet?
Don't rush ever'body, honey.
I know Albert. We're friends.
If y'all don't shut up I'm gonna go out of my mind. And plus you're liable to bust a spring in Karl's head. He's already off balance.
That's funny.  You go to bed and take snot nose with you.
Different ones. The Bible's one of 'em.
Baptized? Well, get baptized then. I don't give a shit. Call a fuckin' preacher, goddamnit! I can't baptize you.
I did live there in the state hospital.
Yeah.
I never was much count at it. I never did get picked out fer it.
Yeah it is. Your name's Frank.
All right then.
He never did want to. I figure he ain't changed his mind much.
How come her to keep bein' girlfriends and all with him if he's mean to her?
Why did he do that, reckon.
He ort not to talk that away to you neither. He ain't no count. He's mean to you and your mama.  Yore mama and that feller that's carryin' me to get somethin' d'eat's gonna be back here directly.
I like the way you talk.
Yeah.
Yeah, I reckon they did. Hit like to tore me up when I read about that pore little cripple boy.
I bet he will. I got a little money if he don't. I'll get 'em for ye.
Hit was borned a little too early on. My mother and father made hit come too early some way or other. I reckon they changed their mind about havin' another'n. I was about six or eight year old then and they didn't care too much for me so I reckon they didn't need somethin' else to worry 'em with.
Make believin' always made me feel good too from time to time.
You will? For sure?
We'll be on teams, me and you?
I dern near had me a touchdown till them boys got a-hold of me there so I figured I better give it off to you. I seen you over there follerin' me.
If I ain't too stove up. I ain't like you. I'm old and give out.  I'm proud of ye.
I'm glad of it you was borned.  I reckon I ain't gonna be there in the garage no more.
That feller's a whole sight meaner than me. He'd just whup the tar out of me.
Like something different. I don't know.  You're leavin' ain't you, Karl?
Did Karl go to bed?
Well, when you like pricing items as much as I do, I guess it's just bound to happen sooner or later.
I stay on my feet all the time at work. I just can't find shoes that's comfortable.
I reckon.
Naw.
Naw. Never did know too much of nobody. Not to he'p me out anyway.
I never was no good with history.
Yes sir.
Yes sir.
Yes sir.
I told 'em about it. They know I'm well. That Mizz Wheatley made me some biscuits.
Tolerable, I reckon.
Well, set down and I'll make some biscuits and gravy.
Okay.
It's all right.  You know I was thinkin' there's this girl that works with me. She's real heavy, but she's cute in the face. Well, you know, she's slow. She's a little bit, I think. She's not retarded, just -- it don't matter, listen to me. I thought you might like to meet her. Vaughan wants to have a little supper over at his house and we could invite her. Would you like that?
I could shore use some. Thank ye.
Ma'am?
Naw, I don't believe you have. I don't reckon I never been in here. This store didn't used to be here.
What's that you say?
Did you knock on the door yet?
I've heard it said that way.
This evenin' I want you to go get Mizz Wheatley and that Frank and have them stay with you tonight.
I know.
Vaughan, don't get pushy.
Why won't he talk to women?
Well, yeah, it's for the school newspaper. But it has pictures. I mean it's a regular paper, you know.
No thank you.
Well, what do we do? We drove all the way out here.
Before they were married?
How am I going to conduct an interview if I can't ask him any questions?
Why?
You mean about y'all bein' together in "that" way?
I think everybody at the store knows that already. They always talk about it. Maureen Ledbetter told a awful story about why you ain't allowed over at the First Baptist Church no more.
Perhaps I should rephrase the question. What I mean to say is, are you married or seriously involved with a significant other?
Actually, I'm his father.
I once read somewhere that one quarter of all the people in the United States have at least one relative who has lived in Brooklyn at one time or another.
American literature. What else?
Which explains why this hasn't been the easiest summer of my life.
It looks worse than it is. I'm okay.
I'd love to.
Uh...  My friend over here would like a corned beef on rye and a ginger ale.
The boys and I were just having a philosophical discussion about women and cigars. Some interesting connections there, don't you think?
The Queen of England?
I guess you could call it a hobby. It doesn't take me more than about five minutes a day to do it, but I do it every day. Rain or shine, sleet or snow. Sort of like the postman.  Sometimes it feels like my hobby is my real job, and my job is just a way to support my hobby.
I don't know, it just came to me. It's my corner, after all. It's just one little part of the world, but things happen there, too, just like everywhere else. It's a record of my little spot.
This is April Lee, Auggie. April, say hello to Auggie Wren.
It's his birthday so we decided to whoop it up a little.
If he's got something to tell me, why don't he tell it to me himself?
Hi, Auggie.
You got it.
Once, about three or four months later. I felt so bad about stealing the camera, I hadn't even used it yet. I finally made up my mind to return it, but Granny Ethel wasn't there anymore. Someone else had moved into the apartment, and he couldn't tell me where she was.
Anything for art, eh, Paul?
You always were a son-of-a-bitch, weren't you? A little weasel with a quick, dirty mouth.
This is private, Auggie. Just between you and I.
It means "happiness."
Why would I lie to you, Auggie? You think it was easy to come here and walk into this place? Why would I do it if I didn't have to?
It fizzled, baby. That's the way it goes. But we had our times, didn't we? It wasn't all bad.
And that's how Felicity came into the picture. During one of those two seconds.
Who the hell knows?  He dropped out of sight fifteen years ago.
You told me you wanted to meet him. Well,here he is.
I'd never be able to talk her into it. And even if I could, those things cost money. And that's just what I don't have. I'm flat out dead broke.
Bully for you.
I almost got married once.
Ruby McNutt. My one true love.
She made a play for me after I got back, but her glass eye kept interfering with my concentration. Every time we got into a clinch, I'd start thinking about that hole in her head, that empty socket with the glass eye in it. An eye that couldn't see, an eye that couldn't shed any tears. The minute I started thinking about it, Mr. Johnson would get all soft and small. And I can't see getting married if Mr. Johnson isn't going to be in tiptop shape.
Enjoy it while you can, Vin. Pretty soon, they're going to legislate us out of business anyway.
This way, gentlemen. Let's retire to my office, shall we?
And why the hell would you give me money?
Good, Auggie. Real good.  All finished.
And how much are these?
And these?
I think I'll take them. 
The refrigerator?
What does that mean?
How the hell did you get into the building?
Thomas? Who's Thomas?
Well, whatever his name is, he's not here anymore. He left two days ago, and I haven't heard from him since.
And his parents?
It can't have been easy on him. Walking around with that on his conscience all these years.
It's a free country, isn't it? As long as I'm not trespassing on your property. I can stay here till kingdom come.
Five dollars an hour?  I'll take it.
Paul. Paul Benjamin.
An ugly piece of hardware, isn't it?  I'll tell you what happened to my arm.  I'll tell you what happened.  Twelve years ago, God looked down on me and said, "Cyrus, you're a bad, stupid, selfish man. First of all, I'm going to fill your body with spirits, and then I'm going to put you behind the wheel of a car, and then I'm going to make you crash that car and kill the woman who loves you. But you, Cyrus, I'm going to let you live, because living is a lot worse than death. And just so you don't forget what you did to that poor girl, I'm going to rip off your arm and replace it with a hook. If I wanted to, I could rip off both your arms and both your legs, but I'm going to be merciful and just take off your left arm. Every time you look at your hook, I want you to remember what a bad, stupid, selfish man you are. Let that be a lesson to you, Cyrus, a warning to mend your ways."
And this one, in case you haven't guessed, is Junior.
Louisa Vail. Remember her, Cyrus?
An abortion, stupid.  I had an abortion the day before yesterday. So you don't have to bug me about that shit anymore.  Bye-bye, baby!
Tick-tock, tick-tock.
I can't believe I did that ... Christ. I'm walking around in a fog ...
No, wait. You can't just walk off.  You saved my life.
Come on. At least let me buy you a cup of coffee.
Then what are you doing in Park Slope? It's a little far from home, isn't it?
Except that there's no bed, is there? And no breakfast either.
Yeah, I can believe it.
Yeah, sometimes.  I like to dabble, too.
Eight-thirty?
I'm sorry. They just... they just slipped out of my hands.
And how long did I tell you you could stay?
Are you going to be all right?
I wanted to give you this as a token of my appreciation.
I bought it. Twenty-nine ninety-five on sale at Goldbaum's TV and Radio.  Well, that just about takes care of it, I guess. You'll be able to watch the ball games. You know, as a little break from your work. 
If they put this Creeper in jail, then you'd be safe.
Just so you don't overdo it. You don't want to die of sleep deprivation before you finish.
That's logical. And if you don't sleep, you don't need a bed. Saves you money, too.  So what's this story you're working on, anyway?
The end.
Pick two or three. Now that the coffers are open, you might as well take advantage of me.
And started to run.
Six thousand dollars. Five thousand eight hundred and fourteen dollars, to be exact.
That's it. In a nutshell.
No way. There's no way I'm giving that money back. It's my money now.
The water was dripping, see... I turned it off, but it was still dripping, and then Auggie had to go out, and so I left the back room ... And later on ... well, later on ... when Auggie came back ... the whole place was flooded. His Cuban cigars got all messed up ... You know, soaked through ... just when he was about to sell them ... to these rich guys in suits....
What are you talking about?  You can't be serious.
I'm not going to do it.
I pay Auggie, and I've got nothing. Eight hundred bucks and a ticket to Shit City.
If you're lucky.  Then again, it depends on what you call living. 
Medium rare, please.
I'm a hemotologist, not a detective.
So the defendant knew the deceased, your son, even then.
Just showed up at my door, big as life and twice as mean.  Wanted to talk to my son.
Is that your third question?
Couldn't get on the boat.  I'd just <u>shoot</u> the feller.  <u>Then</u> tie up, throw him inta th' drink.  And skip bein' the first gill-netter in history to make a successful forced boarding.
All right, what if the defendant <u>heard</u>?  So Carl <u>let</u> him aboard, to help.  And <u>then</u> the fishing gaff?
Well, what if?
Why not?
You're implying th...
At school, she kept mostly to the Japanese kids, and sort of ignored me.  As if all of our times alone together...in the hollow cedar, everywhere...were a secret.
I lie to my parents every day. And every night.
It'll be over soon.  I can get you money.
I'm sorry about your arm.  Kabuo and I.  Are very sor...
Agnostics don't believe or disbelieve, Ma.  We just don't pretend we know.
Seattle boys think he's guilty.  They say the evidence is rock solid.
Nossir.  I'd gone to tell the wid... to tell Mrs. Heine.
Pretty darn clear.
Objection, asking the witness to speculate.
Objection!  Speculation.
I'm sorry, was there a question in there?
But isn't the <u>truth</u> that there are <u>several</u> other ways to explain <u>each</u> of these twelve pieces.
Should have told 'everything'. Meaning, you should have told the <u>truth</u>.
Three kids.  What's she going to do?
To my father.  Everything counts.
Sure.  I could take a fishing gaff and split your head open. Right above your left ear.
Right.  In the middle.  Of the floor.
Yessir, there'd been real heavy fog.
He's done some on-the-spot refit- ting.  You could see the side flange was banged away to make room for the D-6.
Apparently.
Now you've testified that the deceased was a heavy man, and hard to bring out of the net.
He was heavy, but we were real careful.  But I don't remember him hitting anything, anywhere.
She's alright, Nels, thanks for asking.
Even though a D-6 is too big, and the flange had to be banged out to squeeze it in.  Which makes it a peculiar choice. For a spare.
Your report says death by <u>drowning</u>, which means he went into the water alive and breathing.  And the report is accurate...?
If the head was moving fast enough, but I don't see how it could be.
I wouldn't say encouraged.
He had no reason to.
I...see.  I'm not sure I quite get your...point...
Bye.
Funny?  In what way?
It's private.  Go away.
Hey, she's ticklish!
Those two musicians from the garage!
Me and Tiny, we had them cornered - but we lost 'em in the shuffle.
I'll say.
Yeah.  Why?
Dentist?  We been out of work for four months - and you want to blow your first week's pay on your teeth?
No we're not.
He's a shoo-in.  I got the word from Max the waiter - his brother-in-law is the electrician who wires the rabbit -
With you.
Don't you remember?  He has this bad tooth - it got impacted - the whole jaw swole up -
No - nothing.  Besides, it's none of our business if you guys want to knock each other off -
Not yet.  But if those guys catch us, there'll be blood all over.  Type O.
Must be the way their weight is distributed. Come on.
I'm Josephine.  Sax.
You better come help me.
You tore it again!
I'm a girl.  I'm a girl.  I'm a girl -
I just want to make sure that honey stays in the hive.  There'll be no buzzing around tonight.
It's not my fault.  I didn't invite them.
I got pinched in the elevator.
You promised - the minute we hit Florida, we were going to beat it.
We can get a job with another band. A male band.
All right, all right!  But how long can we keep this up?
You - you -
Daphne -  Go on - tell me all about him.
Daphne, you're bothering us.
You got it made, kid.  Fielding wants you to have a little cold pheasant with him on his yacht -
His mother - we need her approval.  But I'm not worried - because I don't smoke.
We've been discussing that.  He wants to go to the Riviera - but I sort of lean toward Niagara Falls.
Then we'll get a quick annulment - he'll make a nice settlement on me - I'll have those alimony checks coming in every month -
But Joe - this may be my last chance to marry a millionaire!
Hello, Room 414?  This is the ship-to-shore operator - I have a call for Miss Sugar Cane.
Yeah, but they're not watching yachts. Come on - you're going to call Osgood.
There's a convention, all right.  There's also the ladies' morgue.
Sssh.  Sweet Sue.
That's ridiculous.
What did you say?
Half-full.
We'll rent some at the bathhouse. How about you, Josephine?
That's from carrying around the bull fiddle.
Will she be surprised. I just can't wait to see her face -
Yes.  He wants me to have supper with him - on his yacht - he's going to pick me up at the pier.
And talk about elegant - you should see the yacht - candlelight - mint sauce and cranberries.
He's going to South America to marry some other girl - that's what they call high finance.
Yes.  For a whole year.
What's the big idea?
I am Cinderella the Second.
You invest in shows?
Sorry.  I'll be on the bandstand.
Bull fiddle.
No, thank you.  I'll walk.
I'll throw up!
Sorry.
And I have a terrible past.  For three years now, I've been living with a saxophone player.
Nellie baby, I'll make it up to you.
It's three weeks in Florida -
I'm not doing anything.  I just thought I'd go home and have some cold pizza -
All the girls drink - but I'm the one that gets caught.  That's the story of my life. I always get the fuzzy end of the lollipop.
I used to sing with male bands. But I can't afford it any more.
That's what I'm running away from. I worked with six different ones in the last two years.  Oh, brother!
I can't trust myself.  The moment I'd start with a new band - bingo!
Every time!
You don't know what they're like. You fall for them and you love 'em - you think it's going to be the biggest thing since the Graf Zeppelin - and the next thing you know they're borrowing money from you and spending it on other dames and betting on the horses -
You're entitled.
Well, now that you've mentioned it -
I might as well stay in there. I won't be able to sleep anyway.
Would you mind terribly?
I don't think so.
You're society girls?
You know, it's amazing we never ran into each other before.  I'm sure I would have remembered anybody as attractive as you.
Tonight?
If it's at all possible -
It's the crews' night off.
Completely.
You're flattering me.
They just sort of leave me cold.
Nothing at all?
Oh, no!
I'm afraid not.  Terribly sorry.
Me?
It's all rather complicated - what we call high finance - but it so happens that the president of the Venezuelan syndicate has a daughter, and -
According to our tax advisers, she's only so-so.  But - that's the way the oil gushes. A man in my position has a certain responsibility to the stockholders - all those little people who invest their life savings -
Well, anchors aweigh, you have a bon voyage.  And if you need an orchestra to play at your wedding, we'll be through here in a couple of weeks.
I told you - I'm not very bright.
I know.  Every time!
Where are they holding the wake? I'm supposed to be one of the pallbearers.
Who's going to raid a funeral?
I never join nothin'.
Hello, copper.  What brings you down to Florida?
Why?
What? Why? What do you mean?
So Tony Pee-Pants starts ignoring Kat. He wanted to play with me.
Sure, disappear. We’ve been walking away our whole lives.
It’s not me. I swear. It’s her. She’s magic.
Oh, no.  She tells this story at every major holiday.
It’s been my experience that the people who hire a prostitute, need a prostitute.  You did the right thing.
I’m a hooker.
What?
Oh, shut up. You’re an optician.
And you do now?
Doesn’t look like nothing.
Oh, hello.
Yeah?
Not for a dog.
When we were together I was “too here,” now I’m not here enough.
I shagged Amy. Two years ago. That’s why I ended it. And then, after you left, sod it, we kept at it like rabbits until we both realized it was absolutely mad. And, you know, morally wrong. Then there was that one other time. And that was it.
You’re funny.
I don’t know.
On the nose.  I tell you what, because you’re so cute, I’ll take care of our incidentals.
Great, with the occasional stabs of shame. Now, listen, this covers the weekend, but as we discussed, if you want to be intimate, we talk money before anything happens.
It’s okay. Hell, I’ve never paid for it. But please don’t feel like you have to explain yourself to me.
Graham Russell and Russell Hitchcock.
A weekend?
This happened to you?
I disappear. It’s not about me.
Show me.
Desperation?
Spontaneously combust?
I didn’t say he was worth it.
Hi.
You have more than one gynecologist?
I wasn’t saving you from him. I was saving you from yourself.
You knew?
Of course, don’t be silly.
It’s complicated, Dad.
Just drunk enough.
I haven’t thought about that in years.
David Lee Morgan. My dog's name is Sounder.  That feels better.
That's right--
Sure--
I have a mother and her name is Rebecca -- My father's name is Nathan Lee Morgan, and...
Yes mam...
:The night in the woods with his father and SOUNDER. The shouting and laughter after the baseball game --
:His mother, with her head thrown back, her eyes aglitter and laughing.
Yes, sir -- I learn to write a little bit, and I can read a lot--
Yes, sir...
"You lose some of the time, what you always go afta, but you lose all the time what you don't go afta!"
Got it hurt in a dynamite blast, son. The dirty dogs had no more use for me, so they let me have time off my sentence, and let me come home.
Where was you, Daddy?
They gone to the field...
And I wanta be with you, too, but this school is somethin' that's good for you -- somethin you need, like good air to breathe, and I want you to have it, boy, and that's the way it's gonna be!
What's that, son?
Nathan Lee Morgan...
Thank you, Josie Mae.
Yes mam...
'Bye, son -- I won't be gone long.
Did you find your father?
It's the heat.
He won't go mad -- he's just lookin' for a cooler spot.
He can't get up, Mama!
Yes, ma'm...
Come in, children.
Thank you, Miss Boatwright.
I don't know a damn thing, now stop bothering me about it!
They probly thought you was crazy.
Don't belong to you! It's for the little important man, here!
Mama, when kin me and Earl go to school with David Lee?
I wanta get some things.
Well, let's get to it, Miss Rebecca,'cause I been waitin' too long a time for your good cookin'!
It's a shame, Reverend. It's a damn shame.
I wanta see Nathan.
Stan, your friends need you. They are in trouble and you must help them.
Now go, your friends are in danger... The USO show is a mile east of here, just over that ridge. The clitoris has spoken.
Can I finish? Hello? Can I finish? ...The United States has graphic images of violence on television all the time, what is that one show? COPS? And car crashes caught on tape? We can't believe that a movie with some foul language and fart jokes would piss you off so much.
About what?
Cartman! What the hell are you talking about?! You LOVE Terrance and Philiip!
No you can't Kenny!
Mph rmprmmh rm!!
Mkay, kids from all over the State have been brought here, because you all share the same problem. Uh, young man... Let's start with you.
You get me Cheesy Poofs with the delightful cheddar crunch, and I'll watch my fucking mouth!
The rest of you are graduated. You can go home today.
Young man, you will tell Peincipal Victoria THIS INSTANT where you heard all these horrible phrases!
Eric?
It's... It's not good children.
Get out of here Ike, you're too young for this stuff!
Baba mama!
Mph rmph rm rmph rm?
Mph rmph rm rmph rm.
Mph rm. Rmph rm rmph rm.
Then move out of the way.
Mrph mprhm mm rmph!
I wouldn't bullshit you kid! Snacky Smores are now available in stores everywhere! No biggie!
We already know what you did. We saw it on television.
KYLE BROVLOFSKI, YOU WATCH YOUR LANGUAGE!!
Uhh... I don't know.
FREEZE!!
Time? Did time matter to the Revolutionists who were forced to eat their own shit while dying in the dungeons of ze King?
No, I mean WE CAN'T LEAVE WITHOUT YOU - we don't know where the hell we are!!
I'VE heard them from Mr. Garrison a few times before...
Yeah...
Our moms suck!
I don't know, dude.
Dude!  It's the V-chip!  It shocks him ever time he cusses!
Yeah, they suck.
Yeah, so what do we say?
Yeah, thanks for going back to hell for us. You're a real pal.
Yeah, but you know, I learned something today.  I learned that getting all worked up over fuck and shit and cockmaster is just stupid... You all focused so hard on erasing profanity that you forgot the most important thing... To love each other.
Yeah, so what if you say uncle raper or dicksucker or, or-
What is 'fisting'?
Wake up, people!  We all have to do things that aren't pretty sometimes! It's the not pretty things that make life worth fighting the not pretty things for! Why do you think children have to be born in hospitals?
We're going to find our boys! For God's sake Sheila, you almost had them killed!!
As Commander in chief, I have ordered our Army to set up defensive positions along the US-Canada border in anticipation of an attack.
Right away, ma'am!
YOU'D fuck your uncle!
You remember... Saddam Hussein, don't you?!
Hey relax, guy. Let's see what the kid wants.
Hey, relax guy. It's just a cruel joke. Rich, chocolatey Snacky Smores are only available up on Earth. He'll never get 'em, see?
Oh I love when you get all biblical Satan.  You know exactly how to turn my crank!
No! It can't be!
This is about freedom of speech, Stan, about censorship.
Sure, Stan! How did you know I loved ice cream?
And ze rope?
Well isn't that great.  Something to write home about.
It certainly is.
I'm sure I will.
Very professional of you.
Hello second mate Barnes. I was instructed to come to the bridge.
I was there.  Officer Taylor accessed my CPU directly to open the airlock doors.  They are not functioning properly.
They are awaiting further information.
I hear you Mac and I appreciate it. Frankly I don't know what I'd have done without you on this one.
There must be some mistake. You sure you hit the right commands?
Why yes Ryan, I am, and thanks for asking.  You don't have to talk to the intercom, I can hear you fine.
Seems like they're cooperating. Hopefully I'll be out of here and on my way very soon.
I don't know.  I really haven't made up my mind yet.  We'll see how nicely they behave.
Oh you'll get it, believe me.  So I'll see you in a few.
Well blaze your ass out of there! You've completely altered your trajectory, are we linking up or not?!
This is a major screw up on your part, goddamn it!
Sheesh!  Aye aye cap'n!
Like that piece of ass he was with.
Not me.  I'm in for the long haul. In nine months I'll have enough to take a few years off.
That's right.
Yes.  Theoretical discoveries aside, there's nothing like the real thing. How about you?
Actually I've logged about 200 hours of simulated space walking at the institute, mostly related to starship construction.
Seen one like it before?
Ready as I'll ever be.
So we did.
Don't worry about me.  Where are we going?
Sure.
What?  What are you talking about?
You too.
We don't have time.  I'll explain later, hurry!
Well, there's no better to way to see the world, than with us.
He's up on the bridge!  He's going to be OK.  Now who's missing?
Are you nuts!  It's too risky!
How am I supposed to know?
Well what would you know about it? You don't have anything to lose.
Because, Taylor wouldn't do that, that's why.
I'm sorry.  The suit compartments are in a non-oxygenated, zero gravity atmosphere.  I'm afraid that's off limits to all passengers.
Certainly.  Anything I can do to be of service.
That's affirmative.
It belonged to my dad.
I should've pegged you guys for bowling dicks from day one.
Lemme see your ball.
We're looking for Buzz Fazeli, seen him?
It was a clearance.
gambling. And it was a safe place for kids, a place where the whole community could meet for some wholesome, clean fun.
But not no more. Now people take advantage. Bowling ain't what it used to be. There's something evil spreading in this sport - like a big, gigantic, puss- ridden -
Is it true they blacked out the whole county giving you electro-shock? Junior looks from one man to the other, breathing heavily, his nostrils flaring.
Kastle's daughter's been lookin' for you.
A beautiful thing. And you know why Buzz? You know what we got? Buzz raises an eyebrow as he buttons his shirt.
I've never had orange whips, I'm from Akron.
I'm your son. You're a hard father to find.
You knew her. You married her in 1963.
You know what a mixer ball is? It's like you, you come out of nowhere and upset things, scattering everything all over. Buzz grumpily waves at him to sit.
I didn't think so.
See ya 'round Maynard.
Clam it!
He's not the guy, Millie. Just whip the whips.
Millie, please.  I don't have a son. I think you better leave now young man. Buzz gestures towards the front door.
Cool!
Hey man, welcome to our parking lot. Lemme give you some advice, if she asks you to dance, make sure her brother's not around. Somebody blew out Junior's pilot light, if you get my meaning.
Who's there?
Buzz Fazeli.
Who's there?
You made me hurt him!
Someone wants to play with me?
No!
He's earned an early retirement.  But enough about losers; Buzz Fazeli is history. Lets talk about your future.  I wanna show you something.
How Mr. Kastle?
I think Buzz is retiring soon. In fact, I think he's retiring tonight. Kastle pulls out a shiny gold credit card and holds it in front of Sheila.
He killed your stoolie embezzler father, and he's gonna kill you next! Sid and Breeze push him towards the van as the crowd's MURMUR increases. Kastle turns and yells over his shoulder.
See! No feeling. Tell Theo what happened to your hand, Junior.
You still got the touch Junior.
Line up where you want it.
Who wants to know?  Zeus!
What do you want with my dad?
It's a vicious cycle.
I'd rather you didn't.
Not while I'm in training.
Nobody in this town really understands Junior. When I went to family sessions for him I realized he was the sanest one in the family. Actually, he's the only one in this whole fucking town who knows exactly who he is and what he wants.
So, what about you?
No, I'm fascinated.
Plan B is your dad.
He said he'd sponsor me.
If you want a professional man, you have to be willing to pay for him.
I killed him once, I'll just have to kill him again.
Plan C. From now on it's gonna be plan C. Both bodies throb and grind, their sandy hands sliding over each others' sweaty skin.
I'm looking for somebody.
What are you -- his mother?  Get Norman, I want everyone ready to go.  Edmunds, the subs?
How long will that be?
You're a fucking biochemist, aren't you?  Can't you tell us something.
Now!
Nothing else.
Storm?  What storm?
A thousand feet.
As best we can estimate, it crashed four hundred years ago.
-- Wait a second --
It doesn't make any sense.
What team?
ULF report?  Nobody's mentioned that in years.  You mean someone actually read it?
But sir, I don't understand.  This report -- these recommendations... they're for an encounter with extra- terrestrial life.
Take a look.
I told you people, nobody goes anywhere unless I say.
So you knew this when you wrote your report?
The message doesn't show a lack of intelligence.  It's smart.  It's approaching us in a simple way.  Like you would a dog.  Holding out your hand, letting it sniff, get used to you.
That's smart.  Let's talk about guns and violence.
Because if Jerry is powerful and also emotional...
But sir, I think it's imperative.  I think the messages, the animals we've seen, what killed Edmunds, the reading you got earlier -- I think they're all related.
Jerry?
Then how can it be chipped?
So do we.  And it seems to have picked up something on it's travels.
It's not ignorant.
She's not gonna know, sir.
She's not gonna know.
If the technology of that sphere is advanced enough -- the way it functions is gonna appear to us like magic.
What is it?
What would we be working on in the future that would make us want to come back?
Maybe it's a message of some sort, you know?  See this red here.
What?  No, I know they're civilians...
Ted, shut up.  Are you packed?  Ready to go?  I want everyone packed.  Now!
What was Edmunds doing outside?
We can't go down there.  We're not prepared.  That deep?  That takes years of training, Beth.  We're just scientists.  Lab scietists.  We wear ties and lab coats to work -- not oxygen tanks.
The library.
A bad one.  It was the only book in there.  Norman, come here, look at this.
What about you?  What happened to you?
Beth --
You did, didn't you?
Don't bother me, Norman.
It's also our only way out of here! It holds three people.  And there's only three of us left now.
You, me and Harry.  He's asleep.
We can't.  The storm.  The waves would toss us around worse than we got down here.  And we have four days of decompression when we get up top.
Get the helium out of our bloodstream.  We go to the surface now, we'd pop like a soda bottle.
In case you die, too?
You don't trust me?
My air isn't... I'm coming back.
Yeah, well, I get that way when I'm facing death and someone deserts me.
All I know is I opened that refridgerator --
Squids?
But how?
How can the sphere do that?
But why is he doing it?
Must be.  And if it is -- it's a part of him not even he can control.
Bingo.
Causes sleep.
"... used as an anesthetic if given in combination with paracin trichloride... "
How long does it last?
I'm feeling better.
Am I afraid of them?  Not during the day.  Sea snakes are diurnal.  When the sun's out, they don't bite. Fortunately for you, I had on my watch.  This is quite good.
Don't you?
If I was, then I would've had to have gone in the sphere, wouldn't I?
Same reason I put explosives around the habitat.  For defense.  For the power.  To protect myself.
No, he isn't.
No, he can't.
You think I manifested the snakes?
Is it?
When you were in that sub -- and that squid was attacking you -- are you sure it was the squid that was attacking?  Do you know?  "I can't get Beth on the radio.  I'm in this tiny sub on the bottom of the fucking ocean.  All alone.  Surrounded by all this water." Was it really the squid that was attacking you, Norman -- or was it something else -- one of your fears?  You never really saw what it was, did you?
Don't you know?
Hear what?
Beth --
It doesn't make any sense.
All that banging and pounding.  I don't know.  We should think about making a good first impression.
We never even had a conversation, Norman.
No idea.  We have no surface support. It transmitted too fast to be coming from underwater.
What?
Fine.  I'm fine.
Good point.  I don't know what you're talking about, but good point.
Then what, Norman?
What is it, Harry?
Page 87 of what, Harry?
What are they?
There's some sort of pattern here. It'll take a minute.
Don't do this.  Don't psychoanalyze me.  I hate squid.  Period.  Just like you hate jellyfish.
Harry?
What happened to her?
When I woke up, nobody was here.
Wisconsin?
Shut up and open the door.
Hold on.
Are you trying, damn it?  Just --
Hurry, Norman.  Four minutes.
Norman thinks we shouldn't be going down.  Thinks it's a mistake.
Think about it.
Gimme a minute here... I think I've got it.
It's been obvious from the start, hasn't it, Captain?  That's why all the secrecy, why no one was told about it?
Arrived?  From where?
Salt's good for you, Ted.  Helps you from getting impotent.
Does this mean what I think it means?
What report?
You mean you don't know?
You're a 53 year old shrink, what are you gonna do?
I don't see anything.
Not that I know of.  Why?
He didn't say much at all.  Honey --
Their bases are very well hidden. All the power of the Empire can't find them... Do you know where they are?
I'm beginning not to like you.
We'll be back before you are, old man.
You might say I'm part of the landscape here.  They call me Ben Kenobi.
But you are... I know your 'Diary of the Clone Wars' by heart.  My father...
That's where my father was killed.
These are doubtful times.  The Empire has grown bold in its disregard of the...
Keep away, I'm fine, I'm fine.
I rarely use it any more.  I have the Force.  The Force is more powerful than any pistol.  You shouldn't put too much faith in that weapon.  Work on becoming aware of the Force... learn to feel its presence within you.  Try to sense what it's telling you.  It's the only thing you can rely on.
You mean we should go after her!...
Try to feel it.  Use the Force...
Stop thinking, and start feeling. Let yourself go.
Keep it with you always.  You'll have more need of it than I.  It will bring the Force to you.  You've already learned to feel it... Now you must learn to use it.
You look great!  The uniform and everything!
Yes, sir.
Yes, your highness. I'll let you open it then.  It won't be too long before they figure out what happened to us.  This has turned into a brilliant escape!
The fourth moon of Yavin.  I've given the coordinates to Chewbacca.
We have a little business to take care of first, but it shouldn't take long. We'll be back shortly.
You're good with 'remotes,' but how are you against something living?
Get Chewbacca.  Try to get around it. I'll draw it away.
He'll be well cared for.
Indeed, sir, sometimes I'm amazed we're in as good shape as we are, what with the rebellion and all...
No, you're not.  What kind of talk is that...
Sir, I have a couple of extra circuits.  Perhaps they might bring something.
I read you sir.
See Threepio!  Do you copy?
Yes, sir !
Passport to the Universe. Who wouldn't want that ?
Your father will never let you.
I'm getting better.
This isn't simulation anymore. Take'er out easy, cadet.
Oh, I don't know... Depends on who you are spending it with.
No, I replotted the course. It's more efficient this way.
THERE !	GRAVITY FIELD... IT'S BIG !
Zander, please... Let's go !
So who's got time to get married ?
Excuse me...!
Please, I... Everybody's lost someone by now. This shouldn't be any different...
A funeral.
Your turn...
I have good reflexes.
Excuse me...!
Aw, you're in love with me... You just dont know it yet.
Shhh...
I'm not, but alot of my soldiers are. Glass the planet !
He requested a combat assignment. There's always a need for experienced pilots on the ground. I had no choice but to let him go... He said you'd understand.
Ibanez...LET'S GO !
Yes, ma'am. Star drive in three... two... one...
Actually, Diz, I promised Carmen...
Looks like, unless Tokyo lets me start.
High school... remember ? Run a flip six, three hole play, and you might score...
You got it.
I don't stay where I'm not wanted.
Hey, they humiliated me in front of everyone ! I'm just supposed to take it, huh ? Well, I'm not gonna, and I guess that proves I just can't cut it.
That you don't have what it takes to be acitizen !
What ?
They ran out of names a long time ago in this part of the galaxy.
Who gave you this idea ? It's that teacher. What's his name ? You know the one I mean.
Looks like rain.
Sorry. Carl's a fine boy...
I won't quit !
Are you kidding ? They always get killed. You want the job ?
Here in Buenos Aires.
Hi, mom.
This would be mine, sir. Acting Sergeant John Rico. I've assumed command on this mission.
This is a Fleet-driven operation, son, and the Fleet thinks my boat will be safer on the high ground. You can have everything else, eh ?
I'm gonna save Carmen.
Yeah, that's right.
Not a problem.
SHUT UP, SIR ! We need pick up now !
Good for you. Go find out.
Kill the bitch.
Yes, sir...
The carbon-units infection will now be removed from the Creator's planet.
The Creator has not answered.
V'ger will comply if the carbon units disclose the information.
When my examination is complete, the carbon units will be reduced to data patterns.
To learn all that is learnable; to deliver all collected data to the Creator on the third planet. That is the programming.
Departure angle.
May I ask Why?
Sir, the Enterprise redesign increases phaser power by channeling it through the main engines. When they went into anti-matter imbalance, the phasers were automatically cut off.
Of course not. I'm aware of Mister Spock's qualifications.
That thing is twenty hours from Earth. We know nothing about it yet.
Decker....!
No more than I expected  Not as difficult as this. I'm sorry...
Welcome aboard, Lieutenant.
Impact in fifteen seconds...
Opinion, Mister. Spock?
Thrusters ahead, one third.
That was the order, Mr. Sulu: Clear the bridge.
Why aren't the Enterprise transporters in operation, Mister Scott?
And whatever you sensed out here....
I have accepted service here as a Starfleet officer... sir.
Intruder scans emanate from the exact cloud center. Energy of a type entirely un- known to me.
Any reply from them?
Transmit image of the Alien to Starfleet; advise we are attempting further communication.
No meaning... No hope...  And, Jim, no answers...! Jim, it's looking for <U>answers</U> <U>itself</U>!
'Is this all I am? Is there not more?'
... and then to reassemble itself <U>combined</U> with the Creator. The most certain way of obtaining all the Creator's answers.
We're ready, sir.
Subspace frequencies are jammed by Wormhole effect!
Evening, Cal.  Would you tell me about it?
Local Drama Group.  Northern Books.  No, it hasn't come in yet.  As soon as it does.  Yup, you too Marge.
What's it called?
Why did you quit?
Don't be so hard on yourself.
N'about ten minutes.  What was your movie about?
It's about a man who gets a second chance.
It was either that, or a sardine.
No, no, I see...
Goodbye.
No, no.  Of course, that's <u>exactly</u> what it represents...
...I always thought so...
Mmm.
Yes...
Well, I guess I'll...get down to the station.  It was lovely meeting...
You'd know better'n me.
That's why you didn't want to take the <u>Mill</u> out...you've...
What?
My glasses fell apart.  I lost the...
Better idea...
You have to sign for it.
I don't drink.
Go you Huskies!
...her unbridled sexuality.  That he...
Going home.
What?
Gosh, you look nice.
Yes...
You got to tell em that you saw the accident.  Don't you?
Doug, this is Joe White, and this is, this, this is my fiance, Doug Mac...
Where have you been, we had a date for <u>three</u>...where have you <u>been</u>...?
Who is this person that you've found?
That's what they call an events cluster. Some guy, nobby orders a Manhattan, fifteen, twenty years, allasudden, three times inna night.
What?
Can't...can't you build the Old Mill?
Whatever it is.  GO <u>do</u> it.  How you doing on the permit?
You told me that about the <u>last</u> town.
Waterford, Vermont.  Where is it?  <u>That's</u> where it is...
This horse is booked.
Hey, Tommy.  Heard your wife's having a baby.
You know who the <u>father</u> is...?
I don't eat vegetables.
Page...<u>three</u>.  Now:  "It's a nice evening."  I'm not gonna say that... "It's a nice..."
He's saying, what are you saying, Bobby?
We've got three days to...
And you go start with <u>that</u> stuff in <u>this</u> town...
Everybody needs a hob...
You mind...?
Mr. Barrenger.
Well.  What seems to be the...?
I'm an attorney, if there's anything you have to say to...
There's other things to be learned.
Thank you.
Then what is the...?
I, actually yes.
It isn't <u>right</u>.  I can't...I...I know I si...I, they, I don't know if they told me it was in the con...
...and, and, and did she...?  And she did the seven shows...
I know, I know.
What?  I have a five-o'clock plane to catch.
He treated me as if I were a child...
...he's right here, Mr. Mayor...
Well, Joe said it, and he's right.
Marty...
Bob Barrenger...Bob...Bob Barrenger's in this movie?
She Doesn't Want to Bare Her Breasts...what, in the "Nude Scene...?" What are we paying her three mil?
You said <u>three</u>...?
Mornin, Chessy...how's the back...?
<u>Fuck</u> the traffic light.  I'm talking about three percent of the adjusted gross of a Major Motion Picture...
This young woman.
He told you that...
Yes.
You should.
A witness to what...?
You mean <u>with White</u>...?
The writer.
Sure.
You bet he did.
You go in her room, take the lilacs from the water, dry them.  Go buy some cellophane, wrap em up, and get a card from <u>Marty</u>.  What's her problem?
We're very upset with her.  Get someone to <u>double for her</u>, her tits, the tits scene, call L.A.  I want to see some <u>pictures</u> of the women's <u>tits</u>.  Of their <u>tits</u>.
Some, you were, you were going to make a reservation for us?  Where's my schedule? Where are we <u>booked</u> tonight?
You built an Old Mill in New Hampshire...
I can only write on a manual.
I grew up on your mov...
Hey, it's with the Gods.  We don't have the money, we have to write it out.  The best or not.  And that's a lesson.  You get your typewriter yet...?
Why?
I hurt my finger.
So be it.
I really don't think you should be talking this way to a lady.
I can write it.  I can't type it.
The breasts symbolize motherhood...
I...?  I saw it.  I was there.
What glasses were you wearing?  Were you wearing your reading glasses...?
No no no no no no no no no find me the money...
She wants eight hundred thousand dollars to show her tits.
We don't have the money.
Is that one hell of a kid?
There's no witnesses...
Would you, tell the guy, get the A.D., someone, somewhere where we can <u>get</u> <u>away</u>, something, I want, you know, last day before the shooting, get away, forget it, have some local food.  You want...
That we could use you in and I think that's quite a fine trade-off all around and an ill wind that blows somebody good.
Sherry, Sherry...
So we just got lucky.
No, I'm serious, election's coming up, a lot of people are pretty upset...
Waal, what was the per-screen average...?
Only second chance we git, z'ta make the same mistake twice...
I hate the crayon Burnt Sienna and people who spit when they walk.
She's <u>dying</u> and <u>Rache</u> is your mother now!
Well you're telling your teachers and your friends --
Look if the truth is you don't feel like talking about this right now that's fine. But don't look me in the eye with a big smile on your face and lie to me. Cause there are only so many lies you're allowed to tell before it starts showing on your face.  You wind up looking like...
That will never happen.
I'll ride ahead.  Nelson, protect the Queen...
Why does Rachel scream?
Or blush.  You look pale.
Well.  It's for you.
Secret's safe with me.
...they all yell 'There goes the Virgin Queen' or the 'Ice Princess', or some <u>really</u> clever cut like that. Like it hurts my feelings.
I call him a fartface or a pervert, or something equally lame.
This is a joke, right?
I'm not.
I didn't forget.  I was up all night thinking about it and I concluded you're too special to look like everyone else.  Orange Red.  That's your color.  Few can carry it off.  Now please.  Help me find your brother.
Here.
Absolutely Duncan I'm on top of everything.
This is my daddy's house --
And this is my room so get out!
<u>Just</u> where I wanna be all Saturd...
But we're hungry -- and I have to pick up my costume for the pageant!  It starts at seven!
That's so weak.
Honey, she won't d...
Suits me <u>fine</u>!
That's because your mother is a fine person, finer than I will ever be.  Now, just this once...
Uh.  He thinks his nose is too big.  But it's not.
No.  But they stand out, a little. Like this.
Oh.  It's an incredibly disgusting, and not remotely sexy thing, that they described in a movie I'd never let you go to.  But it's real.  Does he have an older brother?
But Rache...
I knew where I was all the time.
No, that's your fault.  It's her fault for not watching over my precious son, as if it were her priority.  Which means, the most important job.
What honey?
Honey, this is Thursday.  I pick you up tomorrow, and we do <u>big</u> spaghetti.
I did.  Do I have to eat lamb? Daddy didn't cook it, she did.
Mom...?
Thursday's fine...
Heaven.  I have to tell him he's made a mistake.  He should take Grammy Martha first.  Or Grandpa Norman.
I once threw an entire bowl of jello on my stepmother's head --
Actually, never.  They'll always hate you.  There's a gene for it.
Remarried.  There is no move.
Except for last Thursday when Rachel forgot to pick them up --
Annabelle showed me the new dress. She's amazing in it.
WE are over.
Remember when Mommy and Daddy got divorced?
I live or I die.
Can I please have a cup of coffee?
But it's not on the schedule!
I'm sorry I didn't mean to break your concentration.  I thought it would be a nice moment to rememb...
Well, maybe they would if they thought it was okay, with y...
It's okay, it's twenty minutes.  The horse'll be there.
Not great.  Plus, I've got things on my mind.  You know.
You're not working at Random House, I talked to them.
See, I know that.
Ironic, huh?
Toi.  They've been 'going out' for two weeks.
...going out, yeh.  I had kids of my own, once.
It's a mess, right now.  That's my project when I get back.
Brad Kovitsky.
...go to the park.  In the worst way.
Juggle it!  Move the darkroom into your house.  You've got that room downstairs with the treadmill Luke never uses anyway.  Don't lose your confidence.  Don't lose your edge.
Are we.
Aw.
Worked.  Like a charm.
Is scary.  But you want it.  Gimme some truth here.
Come on, a wuss like me?  The stiff who wouldn't help her own daughter fight back?
I lost him.  I was panicked.
Uh.  You hate my guts?
You'll learn.
Just sit me up.  Nice and tall. Bring Benjamin first.
It's complicated for Jackie.  It's complicated for me...You don't have kids -- you don't understand --
Uh.  Annabelle's video report has been switched again.
Rache, it may take time.
It's no biggie.
Hold your applause.  We're not having fun, here.
No, here's ugly.  'I love <u>you</u>, babe. It's just our <u>life</u> together I'm not so sure about...'
That's not us.
In seven years Jackie's never missed one of Tucker's parties. Where is she?
Tucker hasn't penned Ben's present yet -- it won't be too much longer.
Oh, yeah?
Like what?
He was in a concentration camp?
Be your sidekick, you know, and maybe eventually become a TV talk- show host.
Jesus was not bad.
You're showing how superior you are to your subject. TOBY No, but I like my subject. I like these people.
Oh. What happens now?
I think you should leave it the way it was. It was good.
Yeah...How do we know we won't be exploited?
Gee, you're home early!
Thank you.  So Catherine seems like she might become a really good writer.
...gger.
Again!!
Toby Oxman.
Oh, fine. How are you?
I'm a documentary filmmaker.
Thanks.
But what did you get on your SATs?
Oh.
What are you going to do, Cooper, throw yourself on a Bunsen burner? It's a bunch of businessmen touring a lab.  We'll be out in no time.
We're outta here--
What happened!
I wasn't angry with you I was angry with him.
I guess not Cooper...
It's nothing to worry about.
Are you going to kill us?
Like where--in your dreams?
Chemco's been developing nerve gas?
Chemco is willing to deal with him, meet his demands.  I can have the money there in an hour.
I'm sure you'll figure it out.
I assure you gentlemen if we had something of that magnitude it wouldn't be shelved in a lab somewhere...
I haven't been briefed on any such thing!
Excellent...excellent!
I say we head out.
The thing weighs more than a ton-- you want to roll up your sleeves and try it?!
We've...been developing a product... KZ 70709.
You will not get away with this vicious attack on our peace-loving people.
At his office in the Capitol.
I am sorry.  Sub-miniature photography is my hobby.  It's amazing what excellent en- largements you can make from the negative.
First of all, economic reasons.  It was cheap.  The entire project cost just a fraction of what we spent in a single year on our various space and missile programs. It also seemed ideal in most other respects. It was terrifying, convincing, automatic, and extremely simple to understand.
It is very convenient to place all the blame on a dead man.
And surely you don't expect us to let you spy in our country before you destroy your weapons.
You mean you'll tell us his name???
The three-letter code group.  Or maybe some combination of the three letters. P...O...E, or P...E...O, or E...O...P... let's see, there would be six possible combinations.
Well, you can't do that because he's dead.
Look, General Ripper went off his rocker and ordered the 843rd Bomb Wing to attack with H-bombs.
Didn't they tell you?
Sure...sure, Colonel.  Now look, I'm picking up the phone...nice and slow.  Right?...Hello? ...Hello?  Hello?...Hello?...Gee, it must be edad. Probably the lines were hit during the fighting.
Look, Colonel.  Maybe it's too late. Maybe they've sent Air Command in already.  But we've got to try to con- tact somebody.
What is your name, young lady?
I'm afraid I'll have to ask you to take the film out.
This is General Ripper speaking.
Yes, sir.  I just thought of something, sir.  How do I know I'm talking to you now?
Thank you, sir.
Ask away, Major.
When he said it, fifty years ago, he might have been right.  But today, war is too important to be left to the politicians. Do you follow me, Major?
If we haven't taken any further action, they certainly will.  Doyyourhappen to remember the statistics on our casualties in the event of a full-scale enemy attack?
Our missiles would impact before my planes were even discovered by the enemy, wouldn't they?
You're absolutely right.  You forgot to mention their nuclear subs.  But it wouldn't matter. Sure we wouldn't get off without getting our hair mussed, but we'd prevail.  I don't think we'd lose more than fifty million people, tops.
Where?  Everywhere, Major.  Everywhere.
But we mean it because we are a peace- loving country.  Are they a peace-loving country, Major.
But war doesn't make sense precisely because the weapons can kill an entire country -- right?
I was just going to say, as long as the weapons exist, sooner or later something's going to happen -- and that'll be it for both countries.
Well, sir, I remember an example that pointed out that if a system was safe on 99.99% of the days of the year, given average luck it would fail in thirty years.
General, what's good enough for the President and all the experts he's got working on the thing, is good enough for me.
Yes, sir.  Why don't you stop the fighting, sir?
Peace on earth.
Major, I happen to believe in a life after this one, so I believe I will have to answer for what I have done.  I think I can.
I presume the planes are armed?
Well, what about the Positive Control, the safety catch?  Don't the planes automatically come back unless they get a second order?
Why can't you cancel it?
Admiral Buldike?
Mister President, there were thirty-four aircraft involved.  Thirty acknowledged the recall.  That makes four shot down.
Well, sir, it looks like one aircraft, the "Leper Colony", failed to receive the recall.
Well, the Premier doped it out pretty well. Its primary is their missile base at Laputa.
No, they wouldn't send us in with bombs on an exercise.
Roughly, one-zero-five. I'll have it plotted in a minute, Major Kong.
Lothar, take your checks now.
The dirty, stinking, rotten, sons of B's!! They might have clobbered Marge and the
What?
Zombies set to knock out local air defense four hundred miles from primary.
Roger, keep calling them.  Knock off auto-pilot, Ace.
Lieutenant Quiffer, we're all sorry you were hit, and we'll help you stick it together as soon as we get squared away.
Must be Mach two-five stuff.  Altitude fifteen thousand.
Yeah?
Roger, I'm setting up the CRM-114.
Ready, Major.
Primary arming switch.
Lieutenant Toejam's going to help you in a minute.  Can you check your ECM?
Very interesting.
Skip it and jump, damn you!  This flak's so close, I can smell it.
I've got one.
Well, if they hit us first, they've probably fired off their missiles and got their planes off the ground already.  We'll just be hitting empty real estate.
Master Kong.
Lothar, get up here fast, and bring your First- Aid kit!  I'm hit kinda bad, I think.
In the back...feels like an arrowhead.
Hell, he looks dead.
Listen, give me a shot quick!
Quentin, how's your gear?
But the code is made up by General Ripper, and he's the only one left at the base who would know the code.
Come on, King.  That doesn't make sense.
Roger.
Listen, Lothar.  You know that crack I made about your...butt?
But who would be chosen?
Uh, well, what'd she say? Is Pony coming?
Wait. Racism? You don't know anybody who's black!
Intense.
No. Oh, maybe. Fuck.
Well, sure, he's rich and he's famous. He's got everything and you've got nothing.
What did you guys think?
Behind me. I'm making these slides out of these old pictures and paintings and stuff.
Why is everything about you, Jeff?
Tim, he listens to you. Do you think it's a good idea? Seriously?
Oh. Well, what's it on?
Oh, no, it's not. I mean, they're not all totally in a coma. I mean, they know when I'm helping them.
Stuck, who? What guy? Huh?
Yeah.
Oh, right. Oh, oh my God! Pony, it's so huge!
Oh, yeah, yeah. Wait, um, how do you figure that?
Oh, come on, man. Tell me you wouldn't love it!
Okay.
... idiot! Open the damn door! Go, go, go, come on!
So you can do an album cover?
No, look, this is not about Sooze, alright. Wait, wait, wait, wait. She stayed at the Four Seasons last night with Pony?
No.
Buff, can you listen to me for a second?
Look.
Oh, really? You wanna go look?
Jeff! Let's go!
Come on.
Wait, what happened to the tree?
You're fascist, man. Neofascist.
Hey, don't tell us about private property. This is America, my friend.
Really?
Buff, please, would you jus fuck off, okay? Fuck off!
Yup. Hey, um, so, um, listen, man, I got to go show the tape to Danny at the hotel, and if I get the gig, Erica is gonna teach me how to surf in L.A.
Hey, hey, seven-twenty. Seven-twenty.
Yes I do. My family owns it. It's ours. You don't belong here.
Ah, that's nice. They have many convenience stores there for you to stand in front of.
Naw, naw, we don't have time for all that.
No, no, whoa!
I didn't want to eat this much, man.
I'll be in the car, okay?
It's nice here. It's different.
It's nice to do a lot of things.
Oh, sure.
Jeff, Erica. God, it's so amazing to be back home.
Yeah, she, uh, works for the record company and takes care of interviews and, you know, shit like that, Uh, we were actually just doin' an interview and Erica said she's like to see Burnfield, so...
Pony and I are friends.
Yeah, well, he's from a Third World country. He doesn't have it easy.
Yeah, well, that pizza could feed a family of four in Turkey or India or wherever the fuck he comes from.
Because I'm alienated.
Who were you talking to?
Sooze wants to see him.
Wow, that must be pretty nice there.
Why don't you write a song about Sandra Berhard's salad, asshole?
Okay, great. Well, now he's crying. Are you guys happy?
Ask your girlfriend.
No.
Fuck 'em! Fuck 'em all, man!
No, no. I'm not, I'm not talking about this. I did a bad thing, Jeff.
That chick, Erica?
I hit her.
Yeah, of course they let me out. Chickenshits. I gotta pay some class C misdemeanor ticket. So did I call it or did I call it? She spent the night, didn't she? Hm? Oh, that sucks for you, pal. Oh, shit.
Well, you know, all I can say is, you're a fucking fool.
Oh, shit.
Hey, you saw that brown bitch point a gun at me last night, man. Did you think she was gonna use it?
Come on. You don't think that after they called the cops on me, her and Mohammed had a nice laugh?
You could've come over.
Name one.
One!
Typical male.
Like I'm going to pay twenty bucks to see Neil Moynihan in some band that I helped start.
It was just something that got out of hand. Did anyone get hurt?
Okay, but nothing happened. Believe me, if I thought something really bad was going to happen, I would've done something.
I would've stopped it.
Sooze.
Us.
And?
No, no, see, that's not what I'm saying. I could go to New York if I wanted to, but what's the point? So I can learn how to order a cappuccino? So I can get mugged by some crackhead? So I can see, see homeless people up close and personal?
Okay, well, then, I'm gonna break new ground.
Okay, look. My job is not who I am. I don't need that. Why? What's your goal? Status? Money? Getting your picture on the cover of some glossy magazine?
Jeff likes to argue for the sake of arguing.
No, I just don't feel like it. That's all.
But wait! Sooze, I don't wanna fight. I'm so sorry.
And I fig- and I figured something out.
I, yeah.
Is that a threat?
I'm leaving. Is that alright with you? Do I have your permission? Maybe you want to think about it.
Wait, no, I... Look, Sooze, I figured something out.
'Bye, Jeff.
Hey, man. Jeff. How're you doin?
We sold, uh, over ninety thousand units and uh... and Danny says that we're gonna get a gold record. Yeah.
Nah, nah, nah, nah.
Well, not exactly.
I don't know. Uh, I'm an artist, I guess. You know, there's life and then there's the people watching the life, commenting on it.
Well, I, I didn't say I was special, but it's one thing, you know, and it's another thing to actually communicate it to people. You know what I mean? If a tree falls in a forest and no one hears it, does that make a sound?
Why? What are you gonna do? Huh? You're gonna shoot me for standing on your fucking trash can?
Oh, there you are, honey. We were waiting for you. What happened?
Oh, it's stupid, isn't it.
It's pretty exciting.
I do. Jeff, don't you think Sooze should go to New York and, uh, you know.
I don't want you to do the cover, I, I need you to do the cover.
I'm always serious.
Hey, man, uh, look, if you don't like my stuff, uh, I won't sing it, okay? I'm sorry, you know?
I don't know. I say what I mean.
Yeah, I have, I have, yeah.
Or the future, oh, no, no, I mean... I mean, we'll be working on that album cover, right?
Nobody's fucking anybody!
Where do you get your ideas?
Erica? She said she was tired. She went back to the hotel.
It's none of my business?
Don't do that.
... my manager will slap an assault charge on your ass faster than you can say AA, okay?
Missed it. Can I get a fifth of Old Crow?
Hey, Tim, you know what? You win.
Hey, why don't you swallow your cock and choke on it? Oh, I forgot, it's not big enough.
No car.
Cleo!
It's twins!!
Better enjoy it now.  'Cause tomorrow some little kid falls down a well and we're nothing but a distant memory.
Di?  I just called to say that Conan talked about us again last night.
Bye.
Huh-ha-wha?  Ahh!  I'm under the ice!  I'm uh -- oh...man...  That was a weird one.
You sure?
So then this isn't crazy.  It's a sure bet.
Of course - of course!  Hands in...
She thinks you went to the police.
Diane, I've loved you ever since I first saw you -- right before you kicked me in the head.
Trix...
We're here for you, Diane.
Hee-hee-h-wait a minute.  Hold on, now. What do we do before a big game?
That you?
Oh, why didn't you say.  For two-hundred I got a nice rubber band and a real sharp nail in back... I'll gift wrap it for you.  The deal is fifteen hundred. Cash.  Take it or leave it.
You're kidding.
Don't Martha-fucking-Stewart me!  If you don't like it - you try being a pregnant teen!
It wasn't like the prison we saw - all these women had to shave their heads because they got lice from the filthy lives they'd lived!  Oh G-d, I'm gonna be someone's bald bitch!
Kansas?
Shit!  Yeah, Grandma.  Me and the squad.
Yeah.  "Itchy" sent us.
Hold up, hold up.  Any sentence that starts with "at church camp" ain't leading to the big "O."
Bank branch!
So could half the women in here.  And I'd rather go out with a nice can... So watcha here for?  To say how much you hate me or how much your grandparents hate me...
Well, shit-fire, Kansas, that's the sweetest goddamn thing ever...
I hear she was a terror to work with.
The greatest.  They call me the Elsa Maxwell of the assistant directors.  Hey, easy on the punch bowl.  Budget only calls for three drinks per extra. Fake the rest.
I'm sorry about New Year's. Would you believe me if I said I had to be with a sick friend?
Goodbye, Mr. Gillis.
Dark Windows.  How did you like it?
Thank you.
As for instance?
You'll be waiting for me?
Life can be beautiful!
You don't know how glad I am to see youl
I haven't been keeping myself at all.  Not lately.
Is that so? What's the wonderful news?
I've got twenty pages of notes. I've got a pretty good character for the man.
I tell you this is half sold.
So long.
This story is about teachers -- their threadbare lives, their struggles.  Here are people doing the most important job in the world, and they have to wprry about getting enough money to re-sole their shoes.  To me it can be as exciting as any chase, any gunplay.
Now I see her teaching day classes while he teaches night school.  The first time they meet ...
I'll make it short.
It will?
What were you -- a child actress?
He wants me to come on to Arizona. He says it only oosts two dollars to get married there.  It would kind of save us a honeymoon.
I don't know why I'm so scared, Joe.  Is it something awful?
Lots of people were.  Lindbergh had just landed in Paris.  Come on in.
That's no excuse.  You read the script, didn't you?
Then you could have picked up the phone yourself instead of leaving it to one of your assistants.
That's where the popcorn business comes in.  You buy yourself a bag and plug up your ears.
Don't get sore at me.  I'm not an executive.  I'm just a writer.
Yeah?
Depends on what it is -- a Donald Duck or Joan or Arc.
Only asking.  I did't know you were planning a comeback.
Right now?  Never let another writer read your stuff.  He may steal it.
This is fascinating.
Maybe it's a little long and maybe there are some repetitions... but you're not a professional writer.
I don't know.
December twenty-first.
Oh no.  I couldn't let it out of my house.  You'll have to finish it here.
Where do you live?
You can stay here.
I don't like those studs they've sent.  I want you to have pearls. Nice big pearls.
Careful, it's slippery.  I had it waxed.
It's those feathers.  They tickle.
Come midnight, how about blind- folding the orchestra and smash- ing champagne glasses on Max's head?
"Mad about the boy."
Shut up.  I'm rich.  I'm richer than all this new Hollywood trash. I've got a million dollars.
I own three blocks downtown. I have oil in Bakersfield -- pumping, pumping, pumping. What's it for but to buy us anything we want.
What right do you have to take me for granted?
This is the right day.
DeMille is Leo.  I'm Scorpio. Mars has been transmitting Jupiter for weeks.  Today is the day of greatest conjuction. Now turn around.  Let me dry you.
It couldn't have gone better. It's practically set.  Of course, he has to finish this picture first, but mine will be his next.
Max is a good idea.  He can help with my luggage.  Thanks for letting me wear the handsome wardrobe.  And thanks for the use of all the trinkets.
It's yours, Joe.  I gave it to you.
You can't do this!  Max!  Max! ... I can't face life without you, and I'm not afraid to die, you know.
Goodbye.  Norma.
Thanks.  How did you know I was going to stay, this afternoon?
I sure turned into an interesting driveway.
Madame's doctor.  She has moments of melancholy.  There have been some suicide attempts.
Right with you.
That didn't leave much for Wallace Reid.
That's right.
It's about a ball player, a rookie shortstop that's batting 347.  The poor kid was once mixed up in a hold- up.  But he's trying to go straight -- except there's a bunch of gamblers who won't let him.
Greatest thing that could happen to you.  Now you'll have to sit behind that typewriter.  Now you'll have to write.
Who?
Say that I'm busy, and hang up.
This is the staircase of the palace.
Softball.
Sorry, mistress.
Shut up, and get me a hacksaw.
It's for your own protection.
Later.
Relax. Tomorrow this will all seem like a bad dream. Goodbye.
Are you sure it's all right for us to be here?
It's not important. The important thing is I'm here to find something and I think you can he1p me.
You don't like me? You hate me?
What's that?
It's paradise . We could be very happy here.
Ethan---when I said 'a while' I meant a couple of hours.
Just like that?
Feelings are real. Once you've had them, they're yours forever.
I know what it is. She has this lead container shaped like a gargoyle. Inside there's a silvery ring...
I'll come back as soon as I can.
I did.
I don't know. You seem afraid.
Better eat it quick. It won't look too pretty when it's all covered with ants.
Why George, are you proposing?
I've got things to do.
He's off doing a top secret uh, investigation.
Well, Lucy, it's nice to see you're feeling better. Nice to meet you, Jimmy.
-- Planet. I mean, you were there. Do you think it was natural, or like some people are claiming, supernatural?
How do you know?
But Kara, no one has ever gone from here to Earth. The journey is dangerous.
It's going to be a tree, I think.
It's something they have on Earth. You know, where your cousin went.
Can you create life?
No sweat. When's the rest of your stuff arriving?
This is all your clothes?
Oh wow, I should've known. Me and my big mouth. Listen, you can borrow any of my clothes you want. Any time.
Oh, I don't know. I'm not signed out for an overnight.
Somebody's gotta do something!!
I'm Linda Lee.
What? Me?
Your nightmares are over. I'm taking this back to Argo City where it won't be misused.  You could come too. It might be safer for you.
It's everywhere. But water is always the door.
Criminals.
Of course, my dear. What can I do?
It's Selena. I'm getting so I can recognise her work.
TUESDAY! I got to get it all set up in his office tonight before all those big shots come here tomorrow for the meeting!!
Hey! Y'know what they used to call me in high school?
I seem to be.
For a guy who was lucky to be water-boy on the high school team, you sure got a big mouth, Kent.
And here I am, just standing here. That's terrible. Thank you.
Sure, Lana, I'd love to.
Hey, he'll be all right. Believe me Lana, I know. I was a late bloomer myself.
But all he had was chocolate milk.
I'm talking about salt.  Oh, go ahead, pour it on, relax. That's what picnics are for.
There's a lot of choices here.
No, thanks.
Well, this pate is rather...unusual.
You know, I was just thinking, Lana --  -- someone like you could do do really well in Metropolis --
Old ties are hard to cut.
Well, he's going to get the best home-cooked meal he's had in... in a long time. You tell Superman we think he's wonderful.
I'd better be. Suddenly I've got competition to keep up with.  Your high school reunion article. I though it was terrific. And fascinating.  Especially about the girl back home.  I'll tell you what, Clark, I'll take you to lunch and you can tell me all about it.
Gus Gorman.
Thirty-five.
Man, them people was crazy! How they 'spect you to learn all that jive on the first day? "Hold the pickle! Hold the lettuce! Extra onions! Special sauce! No special sauce!" Ain't nobody found no meat inside that glop yet.
What about this week's check?
Who gets it, the company?
One.  And a half.
Or socks.
Plants. Plants always make an office cozier.
A very wise man once said...I think it was Attila the Hun... "It's not enough that I succeed. Everyone else must fail."  And you are going to do it for me.
Yeah, yeah, I can do it.
First question got to be "Where."
Not "What." Don't need a genius to figure out "what." Need a genius to figure out "where."  He says I'm a genius, your don --  Brother! Bubba! Your Bubba!  See, if y'all don't want them to trace it back, you got to punch this in from someplace nobody'd ever think off. Some little rinky- dink operation with a little mickey- mouse computer. ROSS It's got to be someplace you can sneak into.
Then how's all the people gonna get their oil?
Pumps stop pumping oil. Pipe lines stop pipin' oil. Tankers stop deliverin' oil. Man, this is high stakes.
We've already got some.
Ain't nobody gonna mess with my machine! I'll...I'll... what will I do?  I'll build in a counter-punch! Anything attacks it gets counter- attacked! And wiped out!
We back in Metropolis?
I was afraid you'd say that.  Hey, is there a bus station around here?
Will you stop interrupting ?!  You will command the pumps to stop pumping.
A story like this cries out for great human interest pictures.  The big dance! The Homecoming Game! Mr. Kent posing next to his old locker!
I'd wash that out with some iodine...  Okay, Mercurochrome.
We've already met.
Kent's been invited to his high-school class reunion.
I'm in no rush.  So what do you have in mind?
Tell me.
Bubba, does this woman have the right to burst in without knocking...!
Turn on the light.
53!
How'm I supposed to turn this thing?
Where's the handle?
Missing????
He's bound to slip up sooner or later.
Storms! Floods!
How? Shoot him? You know about him and bullets. Not to mention knives, tanks, bombs...
So all we've got to do is pick up the garbage.  We just have to find our where in Heaven Krypton used to be. Then good old Gus here contacts the Vulcan satellite--
Like fish he is.  I know enough about computers to put a PHD to shame.  Come now, brother dear, you didn't think I was going to let that little man run the show, did you? Gus Gorman telling us what to do -- I'd sooner kiss a pig!
Don't bet on it!
Tourists, about twenty of 'em.
Oh sure. The American answer to everything. Pills.  No, this is --  -- natural.
Well, you shouldn't  Be more aggressive, Clark! Trust your instinct! When you see your opportunity, grab it! I do.
Be my guest.
But this should be exposed. They get	kids here who are just starting out in life and they take them for every nickel they can get. That's what Perry says.
Listen, I've got to give you credit. Your disguise is nearly perfect. I mean, if you fooled me, and I am nobody's fool --
Maybe you wanted to.
Well, not in your mind, but maybe . . .deep in your heart . . .
Your place?  Maybe I should change,  Maybe you should, too.
Say you love me.
Let's get you inside . . . .
He knew. I heard him. I just didn't listen.
Oh, hi.
Never closed my eyes.
You're not selfish at all.
Take it easy. Take a deep breath.
Lois, I really don't see why --
Actually I was trying to catch up on my reading. There's a lot of Dickens I never got around to --
What else is ballast for?
You thought about me in a parka. That's sick, Lex. Really.
It' s fantastic! ----- This place is genius.
Maybe we just don' t know his game plan.
Superman's got something up his sleeve, that's for sure. We just haven't figured it out. Isn't that right, Miss Lane?
Because that is your heritage. Those are the values we lived by on Krypton.
Yes.
Now This I want to hear.
No possibility for parole?
I didn't ask her anything . . .
To ski?
Ahhhhhh -- Alpha Waves.
Certainly. But - Er. Oh Magnificent one, he's just one, but you are three, or four even, if you count him twice.
Really Lois, we've got to stop meeting this --
Luthor, you poisonous snake . . .
Perhaps a small . . . incentive, your 									Ultimate. A tiny bauble to help me jog my memory . . .
Where is his home, Lex Luthor? Which way?
Free!
We must combine our strength.
"Super-sucker . " For once, Lex Luthor was right.
Gosh, I'm sorry, we better get in line.
This is Metropolis after hours! This is what you'll be writing about. C'mon, let's dance.
Don't give up. This is a perfect subject for your series on young Metropolis. Now let's get those knees up!
I'm not avoiding you. I've been very busy and . . . I like you . . . I really do.
Let's sit down. They walk to the table. LOIS calls out to the balcony.
You always overreact, Clark. How terrible can it be?
You haven't been at work . . . you didn't call the office . . .  you didn't even call me. How could you not call back?
Everyone's saying he's . . . dead. But I know that isn't true. I feel it in my heart. I think he just needs help.
And what am I? A Shriner? No, If you'll join forces with me, together we can make the world safe for war profits again.
If my plan works, gentlemen, I'll just take a tiny commission . . . something . . .appropriate. . . a number with a lot of zeros after it.
Gee guys, that's swell of you. But  . . . I've got another idea.
Mr. White, come with me I want to see
Daddy . . . ?
I'd just like to have a little less sensationalism.
One hundred percent.  And I like him that way.
Superman gets mail here?
Something . . . wonderful.
But why the hair?
Quiet! You'll make him self-conscious.
Let's try to keep your I.Q. a family secret, Leonard. Before we launch him against Superman, we have to test him ... see how well he does with mayhem and destruction. Kind of a coming out party under the glare of media covering the Metro Club gala. And once he proves himself, then . . .
Not how I might have put it, but, correct. The remains I sent to the sun included the creatures genetic memory. He'll remember everything that he experienced. Not to worry. He'll find his way back to me.  Did you hear that?
Ready, Uncle Lex?
Destiny.
No, no, listen. I escaped with only one thing on my mind . . . the end of Superman.
High School Physics, Luthor. While I was recuperating I had time to figure out that if your foul creature was born from the sun, it must have been his source of energy.
No . . . it's the way it always is . . . on the brink . . . with good fighting evil.
One of them should've been you.
I've been on the job.
It was hot, yes.
No, Mom. You know I wouldn't break my promise.
Anyway, we Kent's don't like showoffs, ain't that so? A body's got to be humble even if he knows that he's better'n his neighbors.
I know.
Well!
Unbelievable.
He may have a gun!
You described the exact contents of my purse.
Oh.
Not unless you can fly.
It was done with wires. They must have rigged him like they do with Peter Pan.
I don't know, Lois, but I do know a fraud when I hear one. This thing goes against all natural laws.
You're not the only one.
Me and my real estate? How  many other girls, Miss Teschmacher, are lucky enough to have a Park Avenue address like this?
What about dinner? I have to worry about the crime of the century, that's all. Y'know? Am I supposed to worry about what's in the refrigerator, too?  What's in it?
First the pets, Otis.
La de da da...
You ever try to run in high heels?  You probably did.
Ready.
Yours not to reason why, Miss Teschmacher. Relax! Enjoy it!  Just look at that smog!
But so is Vond-El
All of us.
Folks'll ask question.
Guess I'd better hitch up the rig and come back to get that...that thing he was settin' in. What do you make of that thing? Martha? You listening?
I want to know what my child is going to face.
Nine to five it's a Pulitzer Prize, I know.
Unlisted number, Shall we proceed?
I'd appreciate it if you didn't smoke.
You think they're strange?
I guess they are a little odd.
I wouldn't do that. It's against the law.
Sure.
I'll always be grateful, Mr. Luthor.
I...uh...check.
Maybe it's being polished or something. Maybe they're cleaning it.
Oh, Mr. Luthor...
Ah, dear simple Otis. Albert explain it to him.
Makes Cecil B. DeMille look like the Senior Class play, right?
Sure. It's the joining together of two land masses pushed together eight million years ago. The fault line itself is unstable and always shifting, which is the reason you get earthquakes in the California area from time to time.
Maybe I should get help.
I know. I know.  I never promised myself a rose garden.
Alison Jones.
How are you?
And Zoe?  How's Zoe?
Other clinics?  Oh sure.  Clinics, half-way houses, treatment centers, detox units...
Yes.  Do you find there's something strange about this meat?
No you don't.
No, Mr. Ansel.  I wouldn't sue you.
Hi, Mr. Ansel.  Hi, Jessica, Mason...
Was it good?
Why?
I'm not sure.
Goodnight, Nicole.
Because I was driving behind the bus, Mary.  Because I saw it.  I saw it happen...
She's resting.  In her room.
Well, Sam, I might as well tell you the truth.  It's this lawsuit you've gotten yourself all involved with. I want you to drop the damned thing.
It does concern me.
How?
Well I don't want a damned thing to do with it.
That won't happen, Billy.  Mitch Stephens' case is small, compared to some of those other guys.  The way he told me, all he needs is for you to say what you saw that day, driving behind the bus.  I know it's a painful thing to do, but it'll only take a few minutes of your time.  That'll be the end of it.
Why?  You got money from Dolores' insurance with the school board.  We all did.
Billy, that's too early.
Tomorrow I'm going to put Sean on the bus.  He won't want to go.  He never does.  He'll cry and want to hold on to me.
I better get back.
You believe that?
For rabbits?
You talked about it?
Berry-picking.
Mrs.  Driscoll, if Billy Ansel does not volunteer to say so in court, I will subpoena him and oblige him to testify to that effect.
What other people?
Yes.
There might have been a word or two that slipped by.  Maybe you could clarify it for me, just to be absolutely sure.
Summer's over.  It's fall.
I feel like a princess.
Was he drinking?  Could you tell?
What's a ditty again?
Well, if he knew magic - if he could get the kids into the mountain - why couldn't he use his pipe to make the people pay him for getting rid of the rats?
Oh.
The truth is that it was an accident, and no one's to blame.
I object to that form of question. Note that.
And what was the weather like at this time?
There's the Prescots...
Wanda and Hartley.  They lost Bear. He was their adopted son.  A beautiful boy.  Indian.
That's good.  Judges like adopted Indian boys.  Tell me more about the Ottos.
Perfect.
Yes.
Daddy?
You don't believe me?  You don't fucking believe me?
Any criminal record?
Don't know.  Food banks, welfare, church charity.  They scrape by.
Was there anything unusual about the driver, Dolores Driscoll, or the bus that particular morning?
Did there come a time when all the children had been picked up?
You remember that much?
Why were you scared?
Yes.  I looked.  I remember clearly now.  It seemed we were going too fast down the hill.  I was scared.
The ramp?
Sure.  I'll fix it right away.
You and Mom have a lawyer?
My lawyer?  Why do I need a lawyer?
But you didn't lose me.
No.
Great.
There's talk of that.
Yeah, right.
You don't know that.
Waiter, the check.  This man is trying to hold a gun to my head!
You don't like it, do you.  I think she will accept, but I'm not sure. She may be too dependent on her brother.
And with ten percent of his future, you're great, too, Frank.
Not in those exact words - you know what a temper he's got.
I'm late for a date with a dame.
Why, has he bothered you before?
You hear that, Susie...  Continue please...
I'm trying to get Susie to stand up to you.  But your manner is so threatening that she's afraid to speak!
Ten'll get you fifty you're playing hookey from a padded cell!
I thought we were talking about Sidney?
I haven't said anything yet, J.J., but if -
Sometimes I think ALL men are fools!...
Incidentally, what happened to that doll? - You gave me the item last night.  Still alive?
Everyone knows Manny Davis...  ...except MRS. Manny Davis.
Why not break it up yourself?  You could do it in two minutes flat.
I read your column every day...
No, I won't...
A pocket fulla firecrackers - looking for a match!  It's a new wrinkle to tell the truth... I never thought I'd make a killing on some guy's "integrity".
The man in jail is always for freedom.
Is that why you were romancing her, you mutt!  Let's call it quits, my dear.  I'd like it fine if you found another home.  That means the front door is open!  Pack your things, rent a moving van and GIT!  And as for marriage, let me hit you with a few choice facts: you aren't ready for marriage!  You're incompetent - a capricious and shaky frail with a sick fatality for frail and useless men!
I call him the boy with the ice cream face!
He's leaving early.  After this "set".  He'll be out in a couple of minutes...
No.  It's one of J.J.'s occasional beau gestes.  Evidently the fellow's funny, so he gave him a plug.
No.  That's what I mean - I'm being fired for what I didn't do.
Staring.  Consequently, when he approached me on his way out I wasn't surprised, but I didn't let on.
That's what I'm thinking, Rita. Maybe...
What sort of thing?
Listen, you need him for a favor, don't you!  And so do I!  I need his column--tonight.  Didn't you ask me to do something about your job?  Don't you have a kid in Military School?
Sidney, I know you by now.  Don't do a dance with me...
Yes.
Why not you?
It is a favor, isn't it?
Don't you think it's about time you shut yours?  Who are you to tell a man like Frank D'Angelo to shut up?!
- and I just had to drop by and tell you how great I thought you were.
You tell him, I stutter!
But I don't need an uncle, Sidney.
...but you did it for greed, Sidney - and that's pathetic.
Yeah.  A coincidence you should run into the very man you've been ducking all week!  This is my press agent, Joan.
Joan, call a cop!  We'll arrest this kid for larceny!
That was two months ago.  Take your hand out of my pocket, thief!
He's intuitive - he knows he's getting fired!
But he isn't going to like this, Susie.  And he makes you nervous, not me.  No, I take that back - he makes me nervous, too.  But I wouldn't give him a second thought if not for you.
Steve, dear, please forget all of this.  What can it matter after tomorrow?
But you didn't do much about it, Susie.  You walked out, and there I was...solo...and not too good at that.
Negative.  The T-1000 will definitely try to reacquire you there.
Max.
No.  Only an object of equal size.
Yeah, well fuck you, she's a priority to me!
What?
She intends to change the future somehow.
Ready.
SHOOT!!!!
There's not much time left in the world, Sarah.
There's 215 bones in the human body, motherfucker. That's one.  Now don't move!
Unknown.
Why him?
Jesus.  How much do you know about Dyson?
Can you get us in there, past security?
No.  There is another chip.
Relax now, Sarah --
Respect your elders and your betters!
But I promised your mother.
When he made his decision, he couldn't have known everything. Especially not the way people like you do, who've returned from exile and feel that you have a right to pass judgement. Because you are blameless, you think you know best who is a sinner and who deserves forgiveness. But you have no idea how people lived here.
And this, only one of these letters, Major. I have lots of them.
Five minutes.
Why not show Dr. Furtwängler the evidence. It may refresh his memory?
Major, this is deeply offensive and repugnant!
David, I don't understand a thing about you. You're a Jew. Are you a Jew?
Not yet.
Furtwängler's in a different category.
Anyway, Major, why should he leave his country, his mother tongue, his family, his history, his past, his future, just because now, suddenly, there is a dictatorship? Why?
There are good Party members who help, and there are dirty non-Party members who inform on you. Of course, they gave him privileges.
Yes.
Three months.
My father was one of the officers in the plot against Hitler. They arrested the plotters and their families.
Oh yes, Major, I have recordings of all his symphonies. I kept them safe during the bombing. My favourite is the Seventh Symphony.
What's not right?
I received a telegram from Hermann Goering informing me that he had made me a Privy Councillor. I was not given the opportunity either to accept or refuse. After the dreadful events of November 1938, the violent attacks on the Jews, I stopped using the title.
I don't buy that.
I don't remember in detail, there were so many.
I may have, as... as I said, I simply don't remember.
When will my case be heard by the Tribunal?
I need to work. I need to make my living. I live off the generosity of friends...
And what was that?
'Happy birthday, dear Adolf, love Wilhelm.' Or words to that effect. That sounds to me like you were dropping on your knees and saying, 'Okay, Adolf, you win. You're the number one man. Have a swell party.'
Tell me about von der Null.
You sure you didn't call one of your close buddies and say, God in heaven, did you see what that guy von der Null wrote about me? The greatest conductor on earth. I want him out the way. He had the nerve to accuse me I am not playing enough modern music. Send him to Stalingrad. Isn't that what you did? You don't like criticism, do you, Wilhelm?  You surely didn't like them saying there was another conductor who was better than you... Are you saying the name von der Null was never mentioned in your talks with Goebbels?
And what did he say?
And what happened to Von der Nul?
I'll tell you why. You remember we talked about you playing for Hitler's birthday?  And you told me that Goebbels got to your doctors first, that you were tricked?
What?
Speaking to Party members I used their language, of course I did, everyone did.
Of course I know what that is.
I love my country, I believe in music, what was I to do?
It means I wasn't good enough to be a first violinist.
Do you know what's in this archive?
The one he kept in his right hand. Yes, you remember.
How could I forget?
One-zero-four-nine-three-three- one. Or d'you mind if I just call you 'one'?
I was a member of the Communist Party. I was a communist. That's what Hinkel had over me. He knew everything. He held that over me. That's how he made me co-operate.
You don't know what it's like to wake up every single morning of your life terrified, you don't know that - 
Major, we're discussing a man of genius, I don't want...
Of course. You, too. Like everyone else in this goddamn country.
Yes, Dr. Furtwängler was absolutely clear about this: politics and art must be kept separate.
Nope.
Hey, hey, slow up, Fraulein Straube has to take down what you say.
Brave?  To celebrate Hitler's birthday with some heroic piece by Wagner but without the Nazi salute? Bravo.
I won't let the fat kid down.
You're a big help.
I thought you did.
What's it to ya?
Yes.  Don't hurt me.
Hey, I'm not stupid, y'know. They can't build anything like that yet.
I don't understand...
The what?
It's okay.  Forget it.
What?
It was an honor.  A chance to meet the legend.  Sarah Connor.  Who taught her son to fight...organize, prepare. From when he was a kid.  When you were in hiding, before the war.
About where you're from.
Later.  I'm going out for materiel.  Keep this.
If I do, you have to get away, disappear without a trace. Different country, different name, everything.  In case they send another one.
Good fighters.
Pain can be controlled. You disconnect it.
Ticklish?
You're not supposed to.
Yes.
I won't.  Now just relax. Where are you?  Yeah, I know it...on Pico. Are you alright?
You gotta be kidding me.  The new guys'll be short-stroking it over this one.  A one-day pattern killer.
I already did.  No answer at the door and the apartment manager's out.  I'm keeping them there.
Shut up.
Our E.P.S. was one fifty last quarter.  We're up eight cents per share.
Hm?  No, about a year ago.  I was working out of Los Angeles.
Fine, Dennis.  Soon as I get my money for this week.
It was an accident.
I said I was sorry...
I don't think he's breathing.
What are you talking about?
You mean, the guy who turned blue and <u>wet</u> himself... ?
It was a gift... from my brother.
You first.
What's C.R.S.?
Your <u>shoes</u> cost a thousand dollars?
Nicholas.  Nicholas Van Orton.
Why... ?
That tall, bright building.  Near there.
Come here...
I thought...
God, wake up, it's a con!
What do you mean?  I checked them myself.  I made the calls...
Nicholas...
You call them...
... what... ?
Just... wait.  Just wait!  Okay... please, I'm not kidding anymore...
Bullshit.  They killed him. Feingold, Fisher, whoever... they shot him...
Stop talking to them!
That's not true...
Stop it!
What about dinner sometime, when you get back?  Would that be... ?
Big family... small?
Single?
How long's it been?  Since mom died... four years?  How are you?
Too bad, I liked her.  So, you're all alone in the House of Pain?
No.
"Consumer Recrreation Services." What, do they make golf clubs?
Are you still on mediction?
They fuck you and they fuck you and they fuck you.  And then, just when you think it's done, that's when the <u>real</u> fucking begins.
It doesn't stop, Nick.  I paid the bill, I gave 'em their money, but it all started again.  They won't leave me alone...
Everything.  I'm a goddamn human-pinata...
Robbed?
Yes, very lucky.
There's nothing to forgive.
Yes.
What is?
No, thank you.
What's all this for?
No, I mean, what is it FOR?  What are you selling?
A game?
Don't worry.  It's been terrific spending the entire day with your "crack team".
You mean, <u>dis</u>satisfied.
How do I find them?  Their offices are empty.
It was a different floor then...
Like, this way... sort of...
The key?
Have a nice day.
I'm not sure.
I'm just like him.
It's a private matter, for you... I think you'll be more comfortable...
Let me think...  Hordes of men in tuxedos.  Everyone's droning.  Ludwell's trying to break the ice by reciting an off-color limerick...
I know who she is.  Take a message.
A Mister... Seymour Butts.
Pardon me?  I'm afraid I don't...
Is Alan Baer "the Game?"  Is that what this is?
Wanted to wish you luck.  Not that you'll need it.
Follow me.
You know you can.
Sam...  Thank you.
You warm my heart.
Greetings fellow insomniac.
I did okay.
It's somebody's idea of a joke.
Sure.
Why?
Go ahead.
Do we still get paid for the week?
It's a question.
Luke.
Will the two of you shut up!  God damn it!  Maybe the tests were right, Marrow.  She's sensitive, she's vulnerable, but I don't think she's suicidal and I didn't have to test her.  Maybe she wasn't trying to kill herself. Maybe she was really scared. Maybe she really heard voices.
Where in the hell can she be.
Come on Malcolm, it's only seven ohms, it's nothing, it's like a joy buzzer!  And it's not about the pain, it's about the interference with concentration...
And that will be a good place to end this study.
Not the way you've constructed your group, it's just not ethical!
Yes, because someone was always keeping me awake.  Ever since I was little.  That was my job.  I took care of my mother and I had to be there for her all night long, and she woke up all the time.  And after she died, well, it's been a few months, but I still, I still wake up, it's... a habit.  I know we've only known each other a couple of hours, but I'm really glad to be with people who let me talk about this.  I'm really happy to be here with you.
For an American you do a good imitation of the British at their most apologetic.  Pardon me.  Excuse me, sorry, sorry...
I wasn't thinking about my mother's bathroom.
I don't know.
It was.
And they're all locked together in here... and he won't let go of them!
It's not real?  Crain?  He's not real?
What?
Test it.
Good.
Yes.  It's perfect, isn't it?
There were no children.  Rene died, and <u>then</u> Hugh Crain built all of this, and then he died. His heart was broken.
It's okay... we're all here...
Nell, what do we do?
Can't say.  Haven't been here that long.  Well, it's Labor Day, gotta get to work.
Yes.  I've missed it.
You, too.  Happy tossing and turning.
What's his first name?
Maybe he never came in.  If he'd come in, he would have left his bags at the door, right?  Or maybe he got here early, and went for a walk, and fell.  Maybe he's outside.
I don't know.  You've been alone for a long time, maybe you want attention.  Maybe he did it...
I don't know, you know...
I'm trying.  Have you ever kept something to yourself because you were afraid it'd ruin things.
I think so.
Come on!  Why are we waiting?
I'm loyal to things that make me happy.
No.  You're not specific enough to be a person.  You're more like a vibe.
What kind of food?
Just feels like the car behind has been following us the longest time.
Where do we go?
What shit is this.  I just do it.  I don't prepare it.
I wouldn't talk.
Been to the Boat Show.
Yeah?
Lookin' good.
What'd you call that -- the Protector?
It was better than a telegram.
This ain't your lot?
She didn't write to me, did she.
Nick's a nick, n' it?  No matter what state you're in.  State of remorse, most likely -- for gettin' caught.
Gate's open.  I had a butcher's at the house.
Butcher's hook.  Look.  I don't much reckon those minders of his.
They look a right load of wallies. Patrolling back and forth outside the gate, all ponced up like the fuckin' Household Cavalry.  Watch it.
Those aren't guards.  They're valets.
Faith.
He's gotta know why.
Again?
What post office?
Been busy, have you.
Sounds like Beverly Hills.
In Jenny?  'Course not.  How could I be. 'Course I wasn't.
Well, I reckoned, Saturday night, if you were goin' out, you'd probably have to come home first.
My employer.
Proprietor of a London firm.  Of longstanding.
Have you ever known me not to be.
What'd you want me to do.  Stay at home, twiddlin' me thumbs.  Doing sweet F.A. [Fuck All].
What do you think.
Depends, don' it.
I'll bloody well ask him.
She told you all about my details but not about his.  Lovely.
You think Terry gave me access to her things?  Probably sold her clothes.
It's too involved; a lifetime of non- involvement.  Anywhere else I'd be an interesting little number, here I'm just SAG number forty-eight thousand and one.  SAG meaning Screen Actor's Guild.
Still, there have been rewards.  It's sunny.  And some of the producers who call even have credits.
Did you.  What was that in aid of?
Get seven years, did you?
What about your grandmother?
He alive to see this?
A leech on the welfare state in addition. You don't miss a trick.
She told me you were a ghost in her life. Daddy the friendly ghost.  Coming back to haunt her.
She never would have turned you in, not in a million years.
What's in Big Sur?
How do you know?
Good job your lot showed up when they did or it would've been <u>me</u> for the high jump.
As you prefer, squire.  As you prefer.
I can never decide what I like better. Leaving home, or coming back.
Where else?
Nine years?  Is that legal?
Sounds like you need a rest.
The forever kind.
Good luck.
I don't know.
Lemme break.
You bet.
Looking for a bloke named Valentine. Know him?
They're at college.  Or doesn't your accountant even tell you where the money goes anymore.
You know I don't live with him.
I don't.
Tell me.
It's OK, I guess. No, I don't really. I'm not big on music, ordinarily.
Hello, Birdy. I thought that was very good.
We've certainly missed you.
Boy.
Oh, Mr Crane--
He didn't say that.
Uh-huh.
Did she make mistakes?
What's involved, aside from putting up the money? What're you looking for the partner to do?
And how do we share--
Yeah.
Cash.
And I've never been asked--Look, you want the dough back? You know who I am! You--
How's business, Dave?
$10,000! I don't know what to do, Ed. I don't know what I *can* do. Even though I know who the sonofabitch is.
But it's...
Told what?
Me? Us! The party at Nirdlinger's--I told you last week, for the Christmas Push.
Who?
Look, chum, this is a guy, from what I understand, told everybody he was a war hero, right? Island hopping, practically liberated the Pacific all by himself with a knife in one hand and a gun in the other and twenty yards of Jap guts between his teeth.
...who among us is in a position to say...
...Well, he got his mistrial, but the well had run dry. There was nothing left to mortgage; Riedenschneider went home and the court appointed Lloyd Garroway...
Well, of course, I, uh, it's out of my league, criminal stuff. I do, uh, probate, real estate, title search, uh... I'd be absolutely worthless, something like this. Absolutely worthless.
Well, there's Lloyd Garroway in San Francisco. Probity--you know, no one ever said anything iffy about Lloyd Garroway. Conservative. Jury might like that. Might like that here.
Check out the rack on that broad in the angora.
Huh?
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
He's the dead guy.
My name is Diedrickson. County medical examiner.
Hello.
Could you come with me please?
Ah.
Crane? We have to tell you, as soon as you're conscious--is he conscious?
I'm sorry, sir.  You okay?
Why not?
I appreciate that.
He'll be back.  Relax.  We're in good shape.  Your security is air tight. There've been no more incidents, nothing suspicious.  There's no reason to call off the opening now.
Where's the walk-in safe?
Calm down.  I found it!
Eight to the right!  Look!  I found it!
Where the hell are you?
Special Agent Pendergast.  FBI.
Can't really focus on birds at the moment, Pendergast.  I'm tryin' to keep my breakfast down.
You're kidding.
Apparently it's huge.
I'm one of the few who know every inch it, now that John is gone.
All right everybody, hold up!
I'd say we're in its home.
The thalamus and the hypothalamus, perhaps?
I don't believe it.
Let me help.  I can take care of everything.
You are this museum.  It won't be the same without you.
That's not so unusual.  Many plants carry viruses.  Like the burls on Maple trees.
It's like ringing the dinner bell.
It's one of the fire doors.  Good Lord, Margo.  We're trapped!
Look who's here, Margo.
And failed.  These doors are solid steel.
I wouldn't be so sure.
Footsteps!
They were sent to the Center For Disease Control in Atlanta.
Yes, I do.
What is it?
Big as a house.
They were green eyes and they were slit like a lizard's.
Holy mother, what is that?
Keep the animal quiet.
But at what a price.
Margo, you haven't heard?
Yes, he's fine.  Greg... take care of yourself!
Okay.
An invention of mine.  It's a computer program designed to describe the characteristics of a given species from a reading of its DNA.  I call it the Genetic Sequence Extrapolator.
With a DNA analysis from a fossil you can use this program to tell the species and sex of the animal, whether it was nocturnal, what it ate, how it hunted, how big it was...  You aren't here for a lesson in DNA.
Maybe not.
You were afraid of him, weren't you?
What if Whittlesley arrived on the tepui and no monster was there?  Was he desperate enough to create one?
I don't think so.  I think we were meant to think it was Mbwun.  Did Whittlesley's monster have claws?
I don't know.
All right.  If you're positive.
I didn't imagine it.  I know what I saw.  Are you sure there are enough men in there?
When DNA is defective, it often uncontrollably replicates long repeating sequences of the same base pair.  Viruses can damage DNA.  So can radiation, certain chemicals.  Even cancer.  Let's let the G.S.E. sort it out.  I have to get started.  This will take several hours.
It's not supernatural.  Mbwun is an animal.  Part lizard, part human, a genetic freak of some kind, like the half-goat, half-sheep they found last year in the jungles of Vietnam.
Unlock one of the other storage rooms.  We're going upstairs.  We'll leave a trail back to 1012 and try to trap the monster in here.
How?
It's deceptively simple.  Like a Bruckner Symphony or a Matisse.
It's coming.  Run.
What?
You have to!  Listen!  All viruses pass on their own DNA.  Instruct the cells of the host to make more viruses!  This one was different.  It inserted a whole array of genes into John.  Reptile genes, sixty five million years old.  Those genes remade him!  It's not his fault!
I'm in town on a case.  Dropped by to see Vince and we thought we'd see the new display.
<i>A month.</i>
Thank you.
--a dead one at that.
As you know ratings have never been our primary goal.  I imagine we'll lose those voyeurs only interested in witnessing Truman's latest torment.  However, I'm certain that our core audience will remain loyal.
Let's go to some of those viewers' calls.
Certainly a nomination.
And it's all available in the "Truman" Show" catalogue.  Operators are standing by.
Let's take another call.  London, England, you're on "Tru Talk."
No?  Really?  Good, I mean, I thought possibly a pizza.  How about Friday?
Now.
I...I can't.
Yeah, what happened?
Sorry, I'm way behind.
They're...  perfect.  Thank you.
A man tripped and fell on a chainsaw.  We got three of his fingers back on.
--I figure we could scrape together eight thousand.
Good night, Mother.
Are you listening to a word I'm saying?
So why do you want to go?
You blaming me for the traffic?
Why do you want to have a child with me? You can't stand me.
You're having a nervous breakdown, that's what's happening.
Do something...
I spend half my life out in the sun, Mother, why would I need vitamin D?
I'm telling you, if it wasn't him, it was his twin.  Did Dad have a brother?
Hold on a minute, dear.  Here's us at Mount Rushmore.  You remember, Truman--when Dad was still with us - that was quite a drive.  You slept all the way there.
The whole area's being evacuated.
There's no one here.
--How do you know about that?
You're not FBI agents.
What do I do.  I'm a key figure in an ongoing government charade. An annoyance to my superiors. A joke among my peers. "Spooky," they call me. Spooky Mulder. Whose sister was abducted by aliens when he was a kid. Who now chases little green men with a badge and a gun, shouting to the heavens and anyone who'll listen that the fix is in. That our government's hip to the truth and a part of the conspiracy. That the sky is falling and when it hits it's gonna be the shitstorm of all time.
Me?
Well...where would you like me to start? Antarctica is a long way from Dallas, Agent Scully. I can't very well submit a report to the Attorney General that alleges the links you've made here. Bees and corn crops do not quite fall under the rubric of domestic terrorism.
Most of what I find in here is lacking a coherent picture of an organization with an attributable motive. I realize you're very lucky to be alive Agent Scully. The ordeal you've endured has clearly affected you -- though the holes in your account leave this panel with little choice but to delete these references from our final report to the Justice Department. Until which time hard evidence becomes available that would give us cause to pursue such an investigation.
Into what?
Mulder was in Dallas when we were trying to dispose of evidence. He's gone back there again. Someone has tipped him.
Kurtzweil, we think.
No. Don't bother.
We weren't expecting to find those remains, of course. They went right off to Washington.
No. Just fossils, far as I know.
Standing around holding your yank while bombs are exploding.
S.A.C. Darius Michaud never tried or intended to defuse the bomb.
Something's gone wrong -- something unanticipated. Go back to Dallas and dig. Or you're only going to find out like the rest of the country, Agent Mulder. When it's too late.
You can't.
Yes. On the Texas border. Some kind of experiment. Something they excavated was brought there in tanker trucks.
I'm not sure. A virus --
What did it look like?
Yeah, well I don't have them all.
I told you -- he and I were old friends --
Your ass? I just got chased across Texas by two black helicopters.
Where are you, Scully?
It's locked?
Scully, I found the bomb.
I'm in the vending room.
They have divided us, Mulder. They're splitting us up.
Because they wanted me to invalidate your work, your investigations into the paranormal. But I think this goes deeper than that.
They're not doing this, Mulder.  I left behind a career in medicine because I thought I might make a difference at the FBI. When they recruited me they told me women made up nine percent of the bureau. I felt this was not an impediment, but an opportunity to distinguish myself. But it hasn't turned out that way. And now, if I were to be transferred to Omaha, or Wichita or some field office where I'm sure I could rise, it just doesn't hold the interest for me it once did. Not after what I've seen and done.
I was until about an hour ago.
We're being blamed for these deaths. Scully, I want to know what this man died of. Don't you?
I can't really talk right now.
It looks pretty green for this climate.
About a hundred miles of nothing in each direction.
They haul gas in tanker trucks, they haul oil in tanker trucks -- they don't haul viruses in tanker trucks.
What do you mean by haul?  What are you not telling me here?
Mulder --
You saved me, Scully.  As different and frustrating as it's been sometimes, your goddamn strict rationalism and science have saved me a thousand times; have kept me honest and made me whole. I owe you so much, Scully, and you owe me nothing.  I don't want to do this without you. I don't know if I can. If I quit now, they win.
I think... something stung me.
She was with me.
And they want to blame us?
Where's Scully?!
I'm not taking any chances.
A weak vaccine against the virus Agent Scully has been infected with. It must be administered with ninety six hours.
No. Though I have no way to prove otherwise. The virus is extraterrestrial. We know very little about it, except that it is the original inhabitant of this planet.
No! For God sake you've got it all backwards.
That's why you bombed the building. The infected firemen, the boy --
Driver.
What alien environment?
No one believes Kurtzweil or his books. He's a toiler. A crank.
Almost.  Mocky-Lock showed up.
Lucien Baines?
Yes, but, you're a willing participant. Picture Edward in a strange place, lost, frightened...
Yes mother.
No.  No.
Really?  I don't work with violent cases, I work with children.  But even a kid lies.  They love it when they get you to believe something that isn't true.  Don't you think Stargher would do the same?
Peter, okay?
Just like we all have fantasies, right? Things only we know, that we don't share.
What did you see?
This is going to sound terrible, but... I don't think she matters anymore.  Not to him.  He never finished her.  The others...he was able to make them his.
Not Stargher, not really.  He's split himself right down the middle. Good/evil, right/wrong, merciful/cruel. A monster.  And an innocent child.  If I could reach the boy.
Okay, okay...
Carl, do you know?  Like on a map...
I can't leave him!
Yep.  Eloped.
All yours.  My boss says it's one of the strangest requests the Bureau's ever had.
I got it.
No problem.
Mocky-Lock.
"Mocky-Lock is the bogeyman.  Mocky-Lock wants me where I am."
They took care of that, thank you, Henry. 
I think that's the whole point.
Pregnant.  Thanks for asking.
Damn, man, I give up.  Your partner tells you his wife's gonna have a baby, and all you care about is a coroner's report!
Nicole Labetzki.  Victim seven. Forensics found dog hair in her car, but they had a K-9 unit at the scene and never had it checked.
Next time, tell me, okay?
Das mussen sie doch wissen. Ich meine ohne grund wird die politzei doch nicht ins Hans komme Fraulein Schmidt, ein schande...
I'm so sorry, I didn't notice much.
That was the man that brought me some money when Harry died. He said Harry had been anxious at the last moment.
Dr. Winkel told me that.
The police. They're searching my room. Sie mussen doch wissen.
They're forged.
Oh, let me see. No, no that's not the cue. It means she has to sit down.
Tell you what?
Tell me more.
Anna.
If we have to see the Porter we'd better go.
What's the matter?
Me.
Can you imagine a parrot nipping a man?
Oh...
Why are you lying?
From Kurtz. They have just been arrested. But Harry won't come, he's not a fool.
Entschuldigen sie. It was a terrible thing.
They're Harry's.
There's nothing in them.
We loved each other, do you mean that?
It wasn't important.
Poor Harry, I wish he was dead, he would be safe from all of you then.
I don't...
I was a friend of Harry Lime.
Austrians aren't allowed in your hotel. Couldn't we meet at the Mozart cafe?
Just around the corner.
This is forgery. It is very clever.
Yes, of course.
Martins.
No.
Holly Martins.
What?
Calloway - I'm English, not Irish.
Going to find me the real criminal? It sounds like one of your stories.
I'm not interested in whether a racketeer like Lime was killed by his friends or by accident. The only important thing is that he's dead.
Calloway.
You're not locking her up?
A bruised lip.
In Vienna...
It's more like a mortuary than police headquarters.
Well?...
I see.
Which side of the road?
Yes, yes, yes, and then he vanished out there, I suppose with a puff of smoke and like a clap of...
We'll never get him in the Russian zone.
Oh, there you are. Come in here, there isn't much time.
Two thirty.
I haven't got a sensible name, Calloway.
I'd like to visit Texas one day, sir.
Nonsense. Your novels are very popular here. Aren't they, Sergeant?
Goodness, that's awkward.
It is, and I'm gunning just the same way for your Major Callaghan.
Good evening Mr. Crabbin.
What is it, Sergeant?
Well, well, they seem to've been giving you quite some busy time.
You can help her.
As long as they can use you?
Do you know, I don't ever feel comfortable on these sort of things...Victims?
At the end of every chapter --
But he said he died instantaneously.
Only his doctor, Dr. Winkel.
What's the good of another post mortem? Suppose you dig up something - well - discreditable to Harry?
But you will.
The Roumanian?
Hear the details.
Yes, yes, I remember you.
You saw it?
Police? Why police? Das ist alles blodsum was sie da sangen. No, no. It is all nonsense; it was an accident.
Now, hold on.
Of course there was. Some ice for Mr. Martins.
That Harry was dead before you got him to that statue.
Not when I get interested.
Never.
Richard. Hi.
Just take it, OK.
Yeah, that's right. Now could you be quiet so I can get some sleep.
Of course, but look; all these people. If that place existed, they'd all be there.
Why?
So?
What!
Nothing. I just thought you ought to know.
What happened?
Fuck off.
What idiot would lend him money? It would disappear.
Not too bad.
Hi there. Here, take a look.
No.
I do; I follow it. But okay, say God provided the ram. So what? Once Abraham raised the knife, in his heart it was as if he'd killed him. He could never forget that. And neither could Isaac. Look at him: he's traumatized, he's a putz for the rest of his life. By the end he can't tell Jacob from Esau....
They don't have extermination camps.
He's an asshole.
That's a movie, you moron.
Who the fuck are you?
Yes.
Yeah. He's a respected scholar. Even No-am Chomsky says he --
I don't, but...
No, you don't.... If you hated them, you'd study them, so you'd know why you hate them. You know what tefillin is? Tsitsis? Shotness? You know the kaddish from the kiddush?  Eichmann? He went to Israel. He studied the Torah, the Talmud, the Mishnah, the whole bit. He hated Jews.
I have a job.
You're a Jew. Maybe you don't realize it, but you are.
Nobody reads that stuff anymore.
I just read it....
You want it to be an event.
That's stupid. Why would they?
You weren't complaining about my play last time.
Why?
That's stupid.
They don't put them in the Torah. I'll get you a chumash, they'll have them there...Bet...Gimel...Dalid...Hay...  How come you're here instead of with Curtis? Besides the Hebrew lessons...
Vuv...Zayin...Chet...Tet...
No difference.
Nothing but nothingness...Judaism's not about belief.
Oh, am I learning it faster than you did? Maybe I'm smarter.
It's all you talk about. Jewish, Jewish, Jewish. Nobody talks about it that much except the Jews.
And be crushed.
I'll go look....
What'd you say?
Obviously.
How would you kill him?
It's the truth....
German. Mine, too. So who do you think's given more to the world, the Germans -- Beethoven, Goethe, Nietzsche -- or the entire continent of Africa? Ibos, Bantus, Mandingos...
Notice? Like what...?
I don't know. Is that right?
Are all Jews the same?
He says you were bar mitzvahed there, in March 1988.
Do you know who you're fucking with here?
Listen to me....
To discredit me. Because I know who they are. Look, I thought I explained it to you. Those people can say or do anything. And they will. It's all narrative to them, it's... Are you going to print what this guy said?
I don't. Look, stay out of what you don't understand.
I can't help what I think.
With the shoes... There was more than one?
I want you to say kaddish for her. It's the only thing she asked from us....
You do it on the inside....
It's German.
Lina... It's happening. Tonight.
Lina, you said if I was going to plant a bomb, I should --
No, I don't admit it's stupid.
I'm not here to talk about religious law, if you don't like --
Green dot -- shotgun powder. For pipe bombs.  A guy in a lumberyard gave it to me. A donation to the cause.
It'll be enough if we use it right.  Okay, the service'll go about another hour. Say an hour for the janitors, then one more just to be safe... We'll go in at midnight.
Keep driving. Don't slow down.
You said they didn't have night guards.
Wow, that's uh...great...
Get out of my way.
Okay, that's it. You're going back to --
...We have nothing to learn from these people. They should learn from us.
And that's when the Mets started to stink.
Fund-raising??
I was just trying to make a point. If --
I think anti-semitism today is largely a Jewish phenomenon. Wouldn't you agree?
But your man isn't quite a God!
Sorry.  Of course not, definitely not... well, maybe a little.  What did you say?
... So am I.
What d'you mean?
Yes!  The notary is a phony.  He has the same signature as the contractor!
Johana Cross, pleased to meet you.  Well!  Isn't this a coincidence. I really wasn't expecting this... All the way out here.  It's incredible!
In a lake.
... That's what he's here for, isn't he?
Congratulations, Enzo.
Sinister is what I'd call it...! Ours is so much cheerful!  Why don't you come and stay with me... There's plenty of room in my suite.
You know what I'm talking about.
The company asked me to extract everything I could from the wreck; so the divers were trying to get at the engine... and then the boat turned over... in the current... and... look, I fucked up!  Can you help?
Lira?
What does that mean?
Six seconds.
Have the car painted.
No...
I'm sorry... I don't know how to ask the questions.
What?
As I said, second of all you're too skinny.  You've got tiny lungs. I still don't understand how you can dive without getting sick.
Driving isn't the problem, it's remembering the right road.
No.  Thank you.  It's really beautiful.
Long enough to die.  Listen, if you really want to die, that's your problem, but don't do it under my nose, okay?
I can't.
I thought it was a nice place.  Isn't it?
Lucky I was there to save you.
Only to help the medics, I assure you.
I'm glad you stayed.  Thank you.
No?  Huh?  Yes, of course!!
... The way she moves.
I'm not from the sea... I don't understand what you're talking about.
It's me... Johana.
... It's hard you know.  You're so far away and I don't know what else to say.
I didn't dive.
No, I'll be fine.  Can you just hand me a glass of water?
Because you have to find a good reason to come back up again... And I always have a hard time finding one.
Yes Sir, and it has been so for 127 years.
I hope they remembered to take the microwave this time?
Haven't you been listening?
Those are the divers who go down 300 to 330 feet.  They dive with a Helium-oxygen mixture.  At that depth, compressed air is too dangerous because it contains carbon dioxide.
Yes... It's magic.
Then, goodbye.
Hey, it's your Bar Mitzvah. I'm just readin' the Torah portion.
What's your first move?
It's Esther.
C'mon follow me.
Yeah, no kidding.
I said, yeah, about once a week!
Keep going.
Mordechai, I love you. I couldn't let you do this alone.
Mordechai!
We go to the same temple.
When I play bridge with all the girls, everyone has what to talk about with their sons. They show pictures. Their sons are lawyers and doctors and Rabbis. Why can't I show a picture?
...So you saved Hanukkah Mr. Big Shot. I mean, let's be honest Mordechai, it isn't even one of the high holidays.
...I'm not finished yet, mom.
She said to remind you that you're having Shabat dinner by her tomorrow and also to remind you to bring the Manischewitz.
Okay, look. I'm going to work really, really hard on this one. But, please stop with the pressure. I'm already tense as it is.
A stereo type alarm system?
Offscreen gunfire. That Jewish Atomic Clock stuff ate up a lot of our budget.
If you keep your mouth shut and come with me, you won't get hurt.
Whoa, whoa there. C'mon Mordechai, is this any way to treat an old family friend? Let's cut out all the unpleasantness. I admit, I went way overboard with the whole Hanukkah thing. Let me make it up to you. How about a peace offering?  Girls.
I'm just calming the kiddies.  There's no need to worry about Santa. He's just having a peaceful, adult conversation with his nice Jewish friend, The Hebrew Hammer.
Look, Charlie, just be patient. I'll fix everything. You don't want that cat, anyway. It killed two people.
You really think so, Charlie?
Where? Where did you find it?
Watch and see, A day or a week - but certainly this month -- you will have money from a man and then-
Rosita —— I have wondered -—
She's a local. When the dudes come out to New Mexico, they went to wallow in Latin glamour. This is a bad town for blondes.
I bet you try on my coffin some day -- I hope it "fits just perfect."
It's to remind people of the great tragedy that took place here so that they won't ever forget that a peaceful village of Indians was wiped out by the Conquistadores, back in the 17th Century... A band of monks buried the dead and prayed for them and did penance for their deaths —— that's what this procession is supposed to be.
Jerry, I talked to you about the habits of an ordinary wild leopard. This leopard is another matter entirely - - a caged animal travelling around with Charlie How Come for years and years.. That's why it kills human beings.
It doesn't know how to hunt its natural prey.
Caged animals are unpredictable. They're like frustrated human beings. I can't answer your question.
But all those fancy courses were about the dead, Jerry, not the living.
If there were a man like that, with a kink in his brain around here loose, what would he be like.
Couldn't you tell a man like that when you saw him?
No.
To know where that leopard went - — I'm afraid you'd have to be a leopard and think like a leopard. I was a naturalist. That hardly qualifies me as an expert in hunting down lost leopards. I used to teach zoology in a little fresh—water college back East. I gave that up.
Well, I'm hardly Mrs. Leslie Carter —whoever she was. In fact, I'm not even much of a success around here particularly after the backfire on Jerry's little publicity stunt with the leopard.
I'm sure if you are as talented as you are charming, Miss Walker, you have nothing to worry about.
Professional hunters, who rid the state of cougars.
Yes. And I am taking it to headquarters for examination.
Almost three years, isn't it? And have I ever done anything to hurt you?
I thought you might strut this kitten in right in the middle of her act.
Now look what you've done.
We all, had to look at the body. It was awful, Kiki -- awful!
The whole town's in a state, Kiki ——doors locked, people huddling together like scared sheep ——nobody on the streets at night ——
You remember the fellow this morning -- Galbraith. You've got time before the supper show.
Do they close up every year for this Processionist business?
You. Us.
Maybe there ought to be less racket and more us.
You're positive of that, aren't you?
That's funny -- I never knew you to lose that much before --
Kiki, Galbraith said something to me once, -- something you ought to know. We were talking and he said that people were like that ball on the fountain at the hotel --they got pushed around by things bigger than themselves. That's the way it was with us -- and we were too small to see it that way.
Ain’t nobody out there, Mister.
That would be Mrs De Moraes mother, Sir. Mr and Mrs Spitz are here with their daughter.
When will they be back?
I’m afraid I have bad news, Mr De Moraes. I have reason to believe your brother’s in trouble.
I don’t know. He seems to delight in so much sisterly love, he might become determined.
Can it be that you want your brother found?
What... What are you talking about?
Where is it?  He. The boy you said my brother bought! Where is he?
You could say that. And Friedman left this morning for Los Angeles.
You watched the tape?  Friedman and his people don’t just provide little kids and videotapes, Mrs De Moraes. They’re in the import-export business. They run hotels here in London which they probably use as ware- houses and ports of call for their merchandise.
How are you, Mrs De Moraes?
Why don’t you ask when I left the Mondrian?
Leon hung himself...
If-if my car is there, I could be the one who... Why don’t you accuse me of killing my brother?
Good.
Maybe I wanted to give my husband a fright.
Get to the point, will you...
On... Once...  Once... What are we... you going to do?
I don’t know. Everyone’s dead...
Croissants.
The Mondrian, room 504. I was checked out in my absence.
Come on, Mr Lombard. You tailed your man all the way here from Europe. You told me you knew where to find him, remember? Or didn’t I hear you right?
Oh. What... Yeah. Okay.
That-that won’t do. That’s not the way it goes. You saw it, you tell it, that’s the way...
A seminar in a baby breeding farm! Bodies in acid! You think I’ll get anywhere with that? Jesus! With luck I might raise a laugh. They might even send a patrol car to check the place out. Whatever, it’ll be too late.
You cannot walk away from this. You cannot.
This is a bad line.
F-five. The Wilsons and their three kids. They run the place. Look, man, I’ve got to get to...
Got it. Puppies.
It’s Friday night, Jane. What happened to your latest boyfriend?
Your secretary, huh!
Really? And how are you, eh?  Someone called Pierre Dreyer said that a month ago he had dinner with a Brazilian friend of...
May I ask if you are Jewish, Mr Lombard?
Recommended?
Look Mrs Spitz... I don’t know to whom I’m indebted for the recommendation but... I’m not in the business of making oaths of allegiance or giving myself character references. What I do is listen to what the people who care to call me have to say and judge whether or not I can be of help. I hope you can appreciate that, Mrs Spitz.
Leonard. What my daughter is on about, Mr Lombard, is that Leonard is somewhat of a Bohemian. You might as well know that...
You wouldn’t be here if I knew, Mr Lombard. What I do know is that he has not been at work for three weeks. That enquiries to the police and London hospitals have borne no results. And that a check with his bank revealed he has not used his account for four weeks now.
He could indeed, Mr Lombard. But had he done so I think he would have let us know about it.
No. And before you ask, no, he’s not gay! He has had girlfriends, but nothing serious...
The proprietor of his workplace is the only friend of his we know about.  His address is in this envelope with Leonard’s address, keys and other things you might need. 
My rates...
Look, I don’t think you’re fully aware of what you’re playing with here, Mister. Whoever put you up to this either pays too well or misinformed you. Why don’t you just tell me what it is you want so we can do business in a civilized manner, eh?
Maybe you should. Think about it. Those who can afford our goods do their thing without upsetting anyone. Those who can’t do it to kids from the streets or their own family and it makes upsetting headlines.
Boys like the one you met today are surplus. Commodities worth a handful of notes in whatever arsehole of the world they happen to be born into. We improve some lives buying them where they’re not wanted, improve still more selling them where they are. Is that too hard for you?
You’re making a mistake, tough guy. Whoever he is, your guy’s not one of Friedman’s...
Dying without ever reaching the top...
We need a double-room and as I understand you’re here alone we’d be much obliged if you’d agree to move to a single room...
Have you?
Questions can amount to revelations. Now, I’d hate to think I was made to come here carrying a substantial amount of money in order to be subjected to a cross- examination. Mr Friedman led me to believe we had a deal. Do we?
I’ll be alone.
No. Thank you. Could you tell me if Leon Spitz is here, please?
How are you, Rhian?
Where’s your wallet? Have you got a wallet?
Haven’t you? Then why the worried messages on his answering machine, Rhian? I’d have sworn you expect him to be in trouble.
Yes...You-you’re not going to take Shiva away?
He’d come prepared. He had something besides Shiva... ‘Sleeping Beauty’. The Disney film...  Well, it looked like the Disney film. It was something else. I couldn’t watch...
The nineteenth... How come you didn’t know?
Er... Yes...
How’s the boy doing?
No...
Los Angeles?
Huh... I suppose the idea of a one day trip to Los Angeles doesn’t appeal to you...
Uh-huh.
Small, blond, good-looking. She was with him when we met. She had a funny English accent.
Would you know where I might reach her?
Let me give you a tip, asshole - no one pulls stunts like what you pulled in London and here tonight and hopes to get away with it. It upsets people. It’s wrong. Fucking wrong.
Some guy called to let him know the Frenchman who’d called the night before he left London was in L.A. looking to kill him. He did his sums and decided to take the call seriously.
That’s what he said...
Sure. But speak English, will ya, ha ha...
So... pretend it's not a game.
Well... uh -- this might take a little time -- but let me see what I can do.
This I can do.  I was studying at the University of Paris -- till the English invaded it.
I promise...
Jeanne, no...
But how do you know that these -- these voices aren't really just -- well, you.
Me?!  It's not me, it's God who makes everything complicated!  If he's all-powerful, why not let the English stay on their island in the first place?  And why let this war go on for a hundred years?  And why send you out to fight when a girl like you should be at home with your family?  Why, why?!
You listen to your voices, I listen to my heart.
But it is what I want.
If God wants me to win, he will find a way.  And if he wants me to die... if he wants me back... then that's fine too.  Then I'll be with him forever.
It would not be the same without you.
Just give me a moment and then you'll be free...
Yes yes... any moment... you're always so impatient...
Then perhaps the temptation to kill would have been stronger... too strong perhaps...?
So sometimes you were carrying just your sword?
Did you use the sword that you held in your hand?
... so you were in the middle of the battlefield, with your sword in your hand, waving it above your head... charging against the enemy, screaming and yelling... fighting for your life... and you want us to believe that in the middle of all this excitement you never killed anyone?
We want her burned as a witch!
Well what are you waiting for? You've got a castle full of racks and ropes and pulleys:  go and torture the bitch!
I'm on the side of our Mother Holy Church.  Besides, a confession under torture will never convince anyone of her guilt.
Pierre Cauchon, Bishop of Beauvais. As you were captured in my diocese, the duty of conducting the trial falls upon me.
I don't know what you're going to ask me questions about.  You may ask things that I won't want to answer.
I will willingly swear to tell the truth about earthly things, but as for my revelations, I've never told anyone except my king... Charles the Seventh... the one and only king of France.
My name is Jeanne.  My little cross I had round my neck was taken away from me.  I would like to have it back.
Yes.  In the church at Domremy.
I understand.  How much?
Gave you?  Well now, I wouldn't quite put it like that...
Well... we are, of course, enormously grateful for your past efforts, but your task is done.  Now it's time for negotiation... and after many months of skillful work, our dear Tremoille is about to seal a treaty with our Burgundian friends who will no longer lend their support to the English.  You see, my dear Jeanne... as it is written in the Bible, "to everything there is a season:  a time for war, and a time for peace"...
Why do you have to be so bloodthirsty?  Do you enjoy it?  All that blood and noise and pain? Diplomacy is far more civilized... far safer... and far cheaper...
If there was, I didn't see it...
Go on to the next question.
Yes... they were.
For what?
We offer the English a last chance to return home in peace.  If they refuse, we recross the river and attack them here -- at the Tourelles.
Jeanne, with respect -- we can't just attack the Tourelles like that -- it's a very complicated matter and...
Can we -- uh -- discuss this later?
Calm yourself, Xaintrailles.  Now slowly.  Who has finally done what?
I don't think.  I leave that to God. I'm nothing in all this, I'm just the messenger.
So... bring up the reinforcements!
No...!
Yes, but...
Won?!  Such a small word will never do!  This is victory, Jeanne, this is... glory!
Playing...
I -- I -- I...
WHO ARE YOU TO DECIDE IF YOU SHOULD LIVE OR DIE?
I might ask you the same question.
I don't know -- I don't care anymore -- I just want to be at peace!
Yes!
Why not?
But... it didn't just get there by itself.
So your memory's coming back?
Is he the one who spread all this blood and misery?
In His name??
Do you think this cross will protect you?
... to love your enemy as much as you love yourself?
Jeanne -- if we were to ask forgiveness all the time, we'd spend our whole life in church.
Well, I try and talk to him, but mostly he's the one who does the talking.
He never says his name.
It's like this... I...we...all of them.
Wladek, please.
He'll be back before curfew.
Doesn't it say we have to provide these armbands ourselves? Where will we get them?
How will we sleep?
But why me? I thought you only recruited boys with rich fathers. Look at my father, look at us, I mean...
Yes, please.
Warsaw's not the only radio station.
That makes a change.
Just one. Dostoevsky. The Idiot. Three zlotys.
Well, you know what's funny? You're funny with that ridiculous tie.
You're out, aren't you?
They were taking you away.
Hungry.
You'll be deported.
'If you prick us, do we not bleed? If you tickle us, do we not laugh? If you poison us, do we not die? And if you wrong us, shall we not revenge?'
should never have come out. I should've stayed there, fought with them.
Yes, but what good did it do?
You're amazing, Jehuda.
Cow!
Bitch!
You're a dirty pig!
It's easy to get out, it's how you survive on the other side that's hard.
Pack, Wladek, there's no time.
I am... I was a pianist.
We're getting out.
No sound at all?
That is good, yes.
The Alps.
Ohhh ... dear. Not another word From the shock, yes it would be.
Yes, it's unholy.
She lives her own life in New Jersey, America.
I'll be back.
I'd like to make a swap.
The piano.
Te, kawnarna paraikete mo te tahi hawlie 0 te whenna uci.  UNSUBTITLED
What are they?
They are washed.
The marks do not come out. They are scars and hardened skin.
She says, throw the piano overboard.
It must come.
Yes and so do I, but there are too few of us here to carry it. TOO - HEAVY
Joliet badge, Snyder.  Don't cut much up here.
Don't think so.  I know everybody in the place and I always bounce the lamsters.
No, but you're welcome to a free beer before you go.
Thanks.  I'm obliged to ya, but I gotta get goin'. 
He won't know you're carryin' it. C'mon, you gotta help me out.
What do we do?
I checked the place out.  There weren't no dicks in there.
What?
Salino?  Why waste our best people on a small-time job like this?  It ain't no heavy gee we're after. The guy's a five and dime grifter.
Hell yes.  He does this every year. There's nothing to worry about.
Which way did he do, Eirie?
I'm busy, Floyd.
All right, mark Mottola up a little and put him on a bus.  Nothin' fancy, just enough to keep him from coming back.  Get some local people to take care of the other two.  We gotta discourage this kinda thing.
C'mon, you can do better than that. We ain't no heel grifters.
Yeh, Luther said you could teach me something.  I already know how to drink.
I don't know.  Haven't seen anybody.
Well we got some workin' money anyway.
It was too noisy.
Ain't nothin' gonna make up for Luther, kid.  Revenge is for suckers.  I been griftin' 30 years and never got any.
Wonder why he doesn't fly both ways.
Everybody'll sit still for somethin'. What did ya find out about the train, Eddie?
We'll give him the hook on the train, and play him here.  You think I can get in that poker game, Eddie?
Then you'll have to come up with another grand somewhere.
What for?  I haven't done anything.
But what about all these other people?
Think nothin' of it.
Sixty-five.
All right, when?
Okay, Tootsie.
Yeh, he knows that.
Then why the rat?
That's worth fifteen grand to ya?
I was afraid you weren't gonna come. We haven't got much time.
I am after this race.
Give 'em a little time.
Not yet, but...  Hey, there's only a grand here.
How am I gonna do that?
Lt. Snyder doesn't know shit.
No.
If it works again tomorrow, I'll have a half million in cash here by noon the next day.  We split 60-40.
With 20% coming off the top for me laying your bet.  Either way you end up with 40.
Only rents by the month.  Two hundred and fifty for the two of them.
Why don't you pick him up yourself?
Wouldn't that be too bad.  You'd hafta move outa this nice office ya got.
Come on, gimme a break.
No.
Don't start worrying about him. He's a good guy, but screwy.
That is, if it's all right with you.
Don't cry.
You've got to get your mind off this.
What are you talking about?
Dorothy!
You're talking like a crazy person,
Dorothy.... listen to me. I love you.  Don't you understand that? I love you.
You're high enough.
You just want money -- and you haven't any right to any more.  He made a big settlement on you.
I didn't.
Thanks...  we're taking your cab.
He's waiting for you.
Of course we do! We've been friends for years.
Yes.
Yes.
We're at the Normandie for a couple of weeks.  Why don't you drop around?
Yes.
Did she make any sound?  Didn't scream?
Which way did she fall?
Oh, yeah?  People fall toward a shot, you know...  not back from it.  I knew you were lying.
That's the truth.
Forgive me.  How are you?
A new invention?
Better get home before it is.
Must have been in the war.  That might account for the cane and his limp.
Children, will you go into the next room? I want to talk to Chris alone.
I'm asking you.
Man to man, I'm not.
It's a bargain then.  Anything you want to know?
Yeah. Couldn't find a thing. This is the way we figure it.  Wynant goes to Julia's apartment. He finds Morelli there... sees she's two- timing him.  They have a fight. But he figures he don't want to do anything then.... Morelli might squeal.  So he goes away. He don't let his lawyer know anything has happened... he lets him go ahead and and hand over money to Julia to give to him, so that Julia will think it's all blown over. Then, when she don't expect it... he lets her have it.
What do you mean?
Lucky thing for us they weren't in that lime.
Yesterday.  I gave her a thousand dollars.
Oh, then you did hear from him?
He did!
Did you go?
Do you know what they fought about that night he went away?
A brown suit, brown shoes and a white shirt and a grayish tie with red, or reddish brown figures on it.
Let him have his say out.
They'll be here.  Don't worry.  My men are picking them up.
What's the idea of telling me you just knew the Wolfe girl by sight?
Maybe if you quit running around after other women you wouldn't have so much trouble with this one.
Never mind.
Don't you remember....
Hello ....  give me ....  Well ....  ?
Then someone was in with you.  Who was it? -- Who was it?  I'll answer that --  Hello ...  hello ...
Would it help any if I could persuade him to meet you?
I do wish you'd tell me where you're going.
You might do that.  Get me a ticket for...  No, you don't!
Mimi?  ...  Oh, Dorothy's mother.  Does she have to be up to something?
What's all the fuss about? Is he in hiding?
How do you do?  What did you say?....  He is?.... Where is he?  Very well.  He's back in town....  Wynant.  Thank heaven.  He's waiting for me now.  Forgive me, Mrs. Charles...  but I've been so upset.  It's no joke working for a man like that.  I must be off.  Goodbye....  Goodbye,
He gave me a code message to insert in the Times, in case I wanted to get in touch with him.
Hello, Mimi.
I tell you again, I don't want any part of it.  Now you take Dorothy home and...
You should have told them he'd disappeared.
That's not for you to decide. Everybody's under suspicion - especially running off like this --  The police will want his description.  Is this a picture of him?
They'll want more than your word for that.
I didn't knock Julia off.
I wouldn't have any reason to hurt her.  She was always on the up and up with me.  But that dirty little Nunheim -- he got sore cause I clicked with her and he didn't, so he put the finger on me.
That'd be very smart.  That'd be the smartest thing I ever did. Me that a police captain's been in a hospital three weeks on account we had an argument.  The boys would like to have me come in and ask questions.  They'd like it right down to the end of their blackjacks. Now I come to you on the level. Studsy says you're on the level. Be on the level.
This is your party.
Oh, this is Andy --
If you like 'em like that.
We need ice.
I haven't the time.  I'm much too busy seeing that you don't lose any of the money I married you for.
Yes.
Maybe a drink would help you.
Tomorrow I'll buy you a whole lot of detective stories.
All right... shoot!  I mean... what's on your mind?
I'll get some towels. 
Want a drink?
He's got more sense than you have. Thank Heaven you're not on this case.
Well, didn't you?
You did.
Yes.
Let's see.  Where's it from?
Your guess is as good as mine.
Yes.  It's Asta's Christmas present.
I don't know...  This thing has got my goat. I've got to find out.
Sure I will.
I did find him!
That's a fact.
Got a nice evening dress?
Oh, they'll come.  I'll have Guild issue the invitations. 
Thank you, Mrs. Charles.
I'm afraid you're lying, Mimi. You see, I really did see Wynant last night.
Yes.  Nick!
Maybe she has.
Two weeks work gone for nothing.
Home!
Please, I beg of you.  The American army is there.  I am Iraqi.  They will kill me.
It's a fortune box.
No, please, not again.
We shouldn't have been here, Epps.  There is a war going on!
Yeah.
What do you figure it to be?
Basically.  But the map has been pretty precise so far.  I don't think it'll be too hard to--
So we wait.
I heard!
Ready when you are.
All right.  I'll go up, then you send up the gold and--
He snuck in here thinking we were asleep, only I wasn't sleeping.  Would have slit our throats if I hadn't stopped him.
Doesn't matter.  Whatever he wanted he didn't get it.  We've got no need staying around here.  It's light enough.  Let's pack up and head out.
He's an enemy soldier.
I've got no stomach for murder.
We thought--
I have to answer him.
If I don't answer, he'll know something's up.
Knock it off!
Blow me.
Blow me.  Have I said that to you guys recently?  Blow me.
There might be.
Why you in such a hurry to get to shooting?
Just listen to me!  I've been doing some reading.  In the Sixteenth century this region was invaded by the Turks.  It became part of the Ottoman empire.  When the Turks rolled in they raped, they pillaged, the usual stuff.  Anybody who had anything wanted to hide it from these bastards.  They buried their treasures, drew maps, and hid the maps in puzzle boxes.  I read about this, man.  I read about it.
Cool it, Jaeger.  Hey, Wes?  Wes?
And I'm talking about enjoying myself.
We run they'll shoot us anyway.  If we keep driving they might think we friendlies; Iraqis.  Or even if they know we're Americans they might get scared, think we're part of a detachment and keep on going.
Look at you, not even breaking a sweat. You're cool, boy.  You're cool.
I know.  I know.  But I'm saying, if they knew.  We're going to be millionaires, man.  Millionaires!
Millionaires, man.
...I know.
We leave it.
Mine.  Land mine!
Me and Wes are just going to talk.
Epps...
Epps, my leg is falling asleep.
It's a fire fight.
The Shi'ites are on our side?  I didn't know that.
They can't shoot us in here.
If they land, we can take them.  If they don't land, then we've got nothing to worry about.
What does it look like I'm doing?
It's giving.
Is it dead?
I wouldn't know.  I never imagined this. Not in my whole life did I ever imagine this.
Just had to get the pack unhooked from the line.  It didn't seem that long.
Northeast?  That's away from the Hummer; further into Iraqi.
It should, or it will?  Least going back the way we came we know what we're up against.
We'll find our way.
I don't want it this way.  I wouldn't kill you just to kill you, but I can't let you lose the gold for me.  Not when we're so close.
Makes two of us.
Okay.  Then we go this way.
We've got to keep moving while there's still light.
Don't you touch it.
The deal was no one touches it until we get out of here.
Place all alone like that?  Must be a boarder check point.
Probably.
They must have thought we were Iraqi when you yelled to them.  They couldn't tell in the dark.
I just said I would.  I don't think I--
I don't know.  They killed Wes.
With what?  Against how many?
When did you make the switch?
Somebody has to.
How the hell should I know?
The photos.
A headache?
I'm making you uncomfortable.  Baking away in a desert in the middle of nowhere facing three-hundred-thousand screaming Iraqis with nerve gas scud missiles, that doesn't bother you.  But me making a little noise is driving you out of your skull.
Now you need me.
Yeah, you're funny.
What?
What!?
How the hell should I know how much?
You know what I'm doing with my half?
Oh, God!
Yeah, well, we're not.
You have to go with us, Wes.
Anytime you want to do something about it just let--
Those people down there are Shi'ites. You've got Shi'ites in the south of Iraq and Khurds in the North.  Neither of them've got much love for Saddam. Probably figured once the war started there might be an uprising, so he sent his soldiers out to slap them around some.
I know you're a pussy.  I know that.
Just seems weird they didn't chase us.
Correct.  Origin?
You've seen enough.
Don't go.
But...you...
I don't know.
I've got a slip movement to install on my next shift.  I'll never make it the way I am now.
They don't know.
Oh, THX... hold me, hold me, THX holds her tightly, tears in his eyes.  They kiss, and LUH hides her head in THX's chest.
I'm not afraid...I'm not afraid.
No!...No!...
It seems I am destined to endure many frustrations....but at the same time I am secure in the knowledge that the thrust of my studies has been in the right direction, and that even if it remains incomplete, my search has not been in vain.
We're leaving.
THX and me.
On the contrary!  It absolutely proves what I have always felt. We are located in an apparently uniform space with no visible limits.  We are just now beginning to push back the clouds of ignorance and perceive the truth.  We must continue the search.
What?
You know I have a way with the computers.  I can clear myself for any area.....almost.
When?.....How?
Look more closely.
We'll never make it through that mainway...I wonder what happened to SEN.  I'm crazy!  This whole thing is crazy...What am I doing?  My mind is full of so many things I can't think of anything, anymore.  Who are you?
Must be an expressway.... You don't have to stay here, you know....
No......  She's dead THX........
I thought of something.....
Yes...
Off a girl's wrist. A suspect...
Thanks.
When you need us, you love us, when you don't, we're shunned by the rest of the department.
So you're the "Device Squad"... and you defuse "devices"?
Hey, look--
Oh yeah? Prove it.
Yep.
What not bad. You've got a series of bombs, devices, that may or may not be connected, set by one or many nutjobs, who may or may not be linked.
I don't know, it's strange... it's not the best career path, but when you get the bug, there's nothing you can do about it. See, when you beat one of these things... 
I don't know. There's an old saying, when in doubt, cut the yellow wire.
What?
Where you guys at?
Cuz he got the girl, now he's leaving town.
Stay to your left.
Too easy. There's gotta be something else in there, another cap maybe.
T.J., run a trace on this, see if you can pin down where it came from. Whoever these people are, let's hope they're all talk.
It's from an IRA.
Exactly my thinking. Except, none of the targets can actually be linked to government, political or special interest concerns. They seem to be just unrelated industrial companies. Some insured, some not. 
Hey, I'm next.
We've created a monster.
I'm sorry, detective, but you're just not my type.
No shit. I better send Meg flowers just in case.
Hell, I got a gold watch... it just don't work. Maybe they'll give me a new fishing pole, or something useful.
What are you talking about, it's purring like a kitty.
Nah, let's just take a look-see.
What?
My first undercover assignment. I gotta look good, right?
Someone who smokes French cigarettes.
I'll do it.
I promised her she'd be safe.
I know.
And diamonds in the front.
in doorway. He bows, returns into office; door shuts.
He bows, goes. Door shuts behind him.
Well, he knocked at the door. You see, I was expecting two--uh--two business associates.
About tonsils.
No.
I don't care <u>what</u> you say! In Constantinople at least you have streets, sultans, pashas--
The type they marry.
Smart. London, eh?
Just dull.
No, Baron!  I beg your pardon.
Right now! It's very important, M'sieu Laval.
Otherwise I'll call the police
Why should you?
You know, when I first saw you, I thought you were an American.
No--proud. Very proud!
Please.  When I came here it was for a little adventure--a little game which you play tonight and forget tomorrow. But something has changed me--and it isn't the champagne.  The whole thing is new to me. Very new. I've got a confession to make to you.  Baron, you are a crook.  You robbed the gentleman in two fifty-three, five, seven, and nine.  May I have the salt?
You remember the man who walked into the Bank of Constantinople and walked out <u>with</u> the Bank of Constantinople?
Sweetheart, what day is today?
Seven and nine!
Oh, no, darling. There's <u>more</u> sex appeal coming on the first of the month.  It's only ten days ...  Eight hundred and fifty thousand francs.
Yes--Filiba! Venice--Grand Hotel-- room two fifty-three--
Shut up! Don't make up any stories!
Don't you dare lie to me!  I know you love me.  Well, why don't you say something? Come on--be brilliant. Talk yourself out of it--bluff yourself in!  Shut up, you liar, you!  That's what I want!  This is real! Money! Cash!
Lily-- 
Yes.
I remember.
But really, m'sieu, this isn't necessary.
Oh! You didn't read it!
M'sieu Laval!
What's wrong now?
No, no, no!  I disagree with you completely! I tried it once--
Do you realize I have light eyes?
Don't be embarrassed, madame. I'll take it. I need the money. I wish I were in a position to ignore the whole matter. But you know, madame, the stock market, bank crash ... To make a long story short--a member of the nouveaux poor.
Yes!
This used to be my secretary's room.
You think that's too much?
Then I mislay my checkbook--
And so will M'sieu Giron.
Good night.
You're conceited--
<u>Now</u>, <u>let</u> <u>me</u> <u>tell</u> <u>you</u>--
Because I want to make it tough for you.
No--thirty-five! 
Giron...!
Divine ... But that terrible policeman!
Please!  Thank you.
So he wouldn't be confined so much to his office--
Ever had a romance with a crook?
Let me give you a little advice. When you embrace him, be sure to put on your gloves. It would be too bad if your fingerprints were found ...
That's true.
That's right.
The pumps --
An hour, two at most.
Thank you, Rose.
What? You have to get to a boat right away!
Take the elevator to the very bottom, go left, down the crewman's passage, then make a right.
I'm sorry that I didn't build you a stronger ship, young Rose.
And to you, Mr. Andrews.
You are, Lewis.  You rolling?
That's the shape my hand's gonna be when I hold that thing. You understand? I'm not leaving here without it.
Alright. You have my attention, Rose. Can you tell me who the woman in the picture is?
Honestly, Cal, if you weren't forever booking everything at the last instant, we could have gone through the terminal instead of running along the dock like some squalid immigrant family.
She knows.
You wanted to see the propellers?
The Heart of the Ocean. Cal, it's... it's overwhelming.
I was tired.
Sure. Count me in.
Probably best. It'll be all business and politics, that sort of thing. Wouldn't interest you. Good of you to come.
No, but we're making excellent time.
I prefer not to push the engines until they've been properly run in.
Freezing. Maybe a couple degrees over.
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Dawson.
You're welcome. Rose.
If only it were that simple.
Well, they didn't think too much of 'em in Paree.
Well, they didn't think too much of 'em in Paree.
Yup. That's one of the great things about Paris. Lots of girls willing take their clothes off.
Yeah; it was great money... I could make a dollar a day, sometimes. But only in summer. When it got cold, I decided to go to Paris and see what the real artists were doing.
Just move with me. Don't think.
I did, didn't I?  Look! A shooting star.
I don't think so. They've got you in a glass jar like some butterfly, and you're goin' to die if you don't break out. Maybe not right away, 'cause you're strong. But sooner or later the fire in you is goin' to go out.
He does landscapes.
I can't feel my body.
I promise. I will never let go, Jack. I'll never let go.
That's enough.
We were pissin' in the wind the whole time.
Yes. Very nice. Have you met my granddaughter, Lizzy? She takes care of me.
Well, that's the general idea, my dear.
You had it the entire time?!
Of course I know it's gone. You remind me every day!
How can you put this on my shoulders?
Goodbye, mother.
Any woman's crazy to feel about a man the way I do about you.
I had an idea your husband was getting suspicious.
How'd you ever get away with it?
I'm sorry, but you three men can play poker or something.  Shall I see you tomorrow?
This is Miss Marsh.
I can explain--
Don't talk such bunk! She's one of the acts on the ship. I just ran into her by accident.
Glad to see you again.
I'll bet a couple of hundred.
Good-by!
--sorry--got an appointment to play shuffle-board.
Very--your mother?
Anything I can do?  I'd jump overboard if it'd help you.
I'll give you plenty of rings as soon as I get the stones set--what do you think?
Good night, idiot!
Oh, that's Mrs. Rosson--remember, you met her yesterday?
Just met her on the boat--supposed to play bridge with her yesterday--but she wouldn't--so we played poker instead.
What do you know about them?
Make it five.
I'll be waiting on deck.
Jimmy!
No bank roll there, boy.  Lucky I could get you signed on--they picked up that Pittsburgh jeweler--made him talk. The heat's on, Shortie--and those Atlantic breezes are going to be mighty welcome.
It'll never hurt you---Got any money?
No, you're not. Give me that dollar seventy.
Shortie, look!
I'll need it--gave my last buck to the bedroom steward.
Come on--  I'll promote a card game, and we'll be sitting pretty.
She was wearing a white dress with a cute, black hat-- and carrying a bag with S. M. on it.  Funny--her name's not on the passenger list. 
What is it?
Oh, is she? What a shame!  You'll pardon me?
Partners, ain't we?
<U>Me</U>!
Listen, Runt--Quick! Where's the ice?
Hope I didn't keep you waiting.
I'll go with you--
No, thanks--I never gambled in my life.
No, thanks--I'll take a walk around the deck and then turn in--
Swell!
It's a bet--come on, Sally!
Don't be too smart, Jimmy--you're out in the rough yourself. You had an argument with Lother a couple of hours before he was killed--but I'll deal with that later--
Back is in New York.
Sure.
Well. I'd rather see <U>you</U> get it than the company.
I thought I put you to bed.
Well, did you find me?
That's fine.
Let me see now--Don't tell me--  You're dumber than me and I'm dumber than you. I don't get it.
Yeah--if he'd only stick to shuffle-board.
Well, I've seen him here and there. What's on your mind?
Well, I'll tell you--we picked him up about a year ago-- but could never pin anything on him.
Are you happy?
I felt pretty low, Sally, when I heard you were running around with a racketeer--
Oh--I understand you were an important part of her education when she came to New York.
Oh, you dear Atlantic Ocean--how you spread across the sea--From New York to dear old Europe--just for boats to ride on thee--
Oh, all right--  See you later, Toots.
Oh,--I was having so much fun I almost forgot--
Good-night, folks.
Don't ask any questions--just give it to me.
There's a lot of trout in this stream just waitin' for a fly.  I've already been workin' on a young fellow from Chicago--related to one of the big packin' families--on his way to Biarritz for a good time. Likes a little game of bridge and poker.
The country boy's about due.
Well, I helped my hand so I'll have to see you.
That's more like the old Sally--a little bit of fire.  How about Ned?
A tipoff in the right quarter to take his fingerprints and--
I've lost my taste for knickknacks--
Have you ever figured they might extradite you?
S'pose you've never thought of killing him--
This is interesting--  Why didn't you tell me you gave this kid your gun last night?
Say, "Thanks very much!"
He's a swell person. He told me he'd rather turn one guy straight than jug a million.
Thank you.
It all depends on what you're used to.
That's Wyatt Earp.  Made quite a Name for himself as a peace Officer in Kansas.
Well I'm not so go home.
Beauty, ain't he?
Where do you think?  I stole him.
He was quoting the bible, Revelations: "Behold a pale horse And the one that sat on him was Death and Hell followed with him."
Easy, Johnny.  Now ain't the time.  I tell you, boys, even I'm Worried what'll happen once Ringo Runs this outfit!  God have mercy!
And how come you call yourselves Cowboys?  Cowhands ride for the brand.
My fight's not with you, Holliday.
I been having the boy at the Hotel pack us up every night Since your streak started
Yes, but there's just something About him.  Something around The eyes, I don't know, reminds me Of... me.  No.  I'm sure of it, I Hate him.
What's that mean, Doc?  You know I Don't understand when you talk up High like that.  You mean you Don't want to be my lovin' man no more?
I'm a good woman to you, Doc. Don't I always take care of you? Nobody cares for you like me.  I'm A good woman.
I stand corrected.  Wyatt.  You're An oak.
Felt his liver go on that last One.  Get him to a doctor or he'll Be dead in a couple hours.
No...
A man like Ringo's got a great Empty hole right through the Middle of him and no matter what He does he can't ever fill it.  He Can't kill enough or steal enough Or inflict enough pain to ever Fill it.  And it drives him mad. Sick mad.  Cold and dirty.
That's all right, Doc.  Don't worry.
Hurts.  Hurts pretty bad.
Not half as bad as I feel.
Not so sure.  Somethin' tells me It gets harder from here in.  Should've held out for more money.
It rides right at 'em.  Like McMasters said, see it through to The end.
Easy now... That mare's in season.
I don't know, make some money, Have some kids, you know.
How would you know?
Well you're different, no arguing That.  But you're a lady all right. I'll take my oath on it.
Getting late.  We better get back.
Look, it's too much of a tangle. I already cast my lot.  I can't go Back and I can't sneak, feel back Enough as it is.
I can't, I'm sorry.  Forgive me.
Wait!
Why don't you get rid of him and Get yourself straight dealer?
Mattie, they're here!  Folks this Is Celia Ann but you can call her Mattie.  Or even Mrs.  Earp if you Prefer.
I know what I'm doing.  Where have You been?
I don't know.  I'm all right.
Sure I'm sure.  What is this?
I need it.
Will you go to her and tell her Right in front of me she's Nothing to you?  Right out loud so I can hear?  Tell her she's Nothing, tell her she's nobody, Just dirt?  Will you do that?
You wanted to talk?
'Least they don't scare women.
Drop his horse.
So he can tell the story.
Maybe, yeah.  Hell, I don't know.
Come on, we're not about pickin' Fights.  Just gonna keep a little Order, that's all.
I know.  And nobody can make him.
I'm the one made a mess.  Made a Right fair mess of the whole thing.
Morg, use your head.
Will somebody get the damn dog out-
Easy Morg, don't think about that now.
Just wanted to let you know You're sitting in my chair.
Yeah.  It's a fact.
Doc's just in no kinda shape.
Better go with 'em, honey.  Here's Where I leave you.
Virgil, please.  Don't do this to me.
Nothing to do with me?  I'm your Brother for Christ's sake.  God, I Don't believe this.  Talk to him, will you?  Or hit him.  Oh no, don't tell me...
Easy, Virge, they're just tryin' To egg us on.
Bundle up, Virge.  Cold out there.
I resent your tone, sir. I have men who are missing -
You might say I've always been one of Mr. Valentin's biggest followers.
Which part? The Colonel's? Or yours?
I see.
I can feel your pain.
Precisely, Mr. Bond. In a matter of minutes, the boring device will arrive at the core of the reactor...  And when the radioactive blades cut into the plutonium -
Take the girl. Leave the handcuffs. We'll drown her at sea.
Hello, James. Enjoy your meeting?
Moneypenny! How indiscreet! Have you ever known me to kiss and tell?
No, 007. It's just that I've learned from personal experience - that when we get what we want -  Somehow the reality is never as... Satisfying as the fantasy.
Occasionally, yes.  British media mogul. Born in Hong Kong; controls newspapers, TV, radio, cable, satellites; books, magazines, movies, computer software. Theme parks.
Q's retirement party. I'd just put the knife into the cake, and -
Hey - the world is my office.
Hell. The CIA built that club.
Jack Wade. Citibank. Commercial loan division. If you're ever lookin' for a sweet refinance on the boat -
Three. You? Married?
I didn't think so.
Chaperone. I'm waiting for my dinner date.
So what brings you to Kuala Lumpur, Mr. Bond?  Wait - don't tell me: Unhappy marriage? Running from some poor little girl with two kids and a Chanel pocketbook in - London?
Let's not make it a habit.
I hope so.
- You're not.
Thank you.  "Now hear this: Drop dead."
My father left me the business.
Of course.
I have an excellent teacher.  'Make sure you wear the uniform'?
Good for you, Miss Winch. You now have exactly 30 seconds to get this rust bucket out of here.
My timing always was lousy.
You have to leave -
I should have hired this man.  Get somebody up there!
It's Bond!
Who is it?
Will you still get the money from your father?
Pops put Big Daddy's farm in Rhonda's and Sunny's name and fixed it so no one can borrow on it.
Do you think you won?
What for?
Don't make me raise my hand to you. You have to see for yourself that you are going in the wrong direction.
That is called a crab apple switch. It's for those bad acting monkeys and just the thing for a mean dog. Now I don't know if I actually did what I did or got my life and story mixed in with other folk's stories but I seem to recall that I had to use my crab apple on a boy from back home. I was up in Memphis working on the railroad, like your daddy who had an easy job. He would sing a song that had a cadence and we would lay track. Anyway I was coming down Beale Street and I heard this music coming from a saloon. Sure enough it was Emory. My daddy taught both of us to play but Emory was natural at it. Got in a blues band and what not. He and another boy had killed a boy named Hocker sometime back and they balled the Jack leaving town. Emory had lost one eye and had a scar running down his face. Bad luck I would say. He got to drinking that corn liquor. We went to his girl's room and he wouldn't stop drinking. He started talking about the old days and he went mad. He pulled his knife and I got to mine first. The lights went out.
It is just a regular card.
I always had chickens, ducks and whatnots.
Now how far would further out be?
Everyone is gone. Rhonda is in the bathroom.
Don't bother the poor boy. It just takes some people a little longer to figure out who they are.
You and Babe Brother are so much alike...
No, I'm too hot now.
I need to get out there and get those weeds out.
Why didn't you catch a plane?
I'm going to wash up now. You all please excuse me.
It was slow. Now it seems like everyone is having births at home.
Everything these days is made overseas.
'Course, you could be right. Your sons are alive. All my sons are dead.
I'm glad you brought that up as to who you are. I have to know who is in my house.
Strange as it may seem, it might have cleared the waters. Sometimes the right action comes from the wrong reason.
That's nice.
Girl, do you still sing and dance?
No. No. No. No. I had my Child at Cedars and Sinai. And that ain't no county hospital. You have to have cash or check before you come in the door.
Junior's wife kept her afterbirth' in the refrigerator. That's why I do not eat over there now.
He's just raffish. Harry put him up to it. Before evening sun sets, I would have his belongings back on Route 55, that old fox.
Don't shout!
I want to hear what happened. My brother is a jackass and a damn fool. The both of you have been as scarce as hen's teeth.
Whether the boy hears it or not, the man is still a jackass. Everyone should have some mother wit.
You know the man next door is near death.
I know you didn't but you have been so thoughtful.
Now go get Molly.  Your friends are going to be here any minute.
Oh, yeah!
You can bring ONE toy...
But Mom, I can't find him!
Honey, I'm sure he's around. You'll find him.
Sure!  I'll even let you drive.
Yeah -- when you're sixteen.
Pizza Planet!  Yeah!!!
Rocky!  The ramp!
Watch yourself!!
Excuse me.
No, you can't.
Oh, yeah, tough guy?!
Where?
Nothing that concerns you spacemen. Just us TOYS.
You mean that happy child?
Buzz, I would love to see you try.  'Course I'd love to see you as a crater.
Sorry.
Alright Buzz, get ready...
Still no word from Star Command. We're not that far from the spaceport --
Hey!!  Hey!  How are you doing that? Stop that!
Sorry guys, but dinner's canceled!
Years of Academy training...wasted!!
You did it!  Next stop.  Andy.
This isn't flying.  This is falling -- with style!
Oh, quit your whining and pay up.
Oh no, Hannah!
She's sick!
Wait!  Wait!  I got a better idea! How about we DON'T?!
No, I'm not!  Buzz, come over here and you just tell the nice toys that you're not dead.
You murdering dog!
Hey, these guys are professionals. They're the best.  C'mon, they're not lying down on the job.
Wait!  There's a nice little one over there!
There aren't any more!  That's the whole barrel.
He got it, Woody!
Sir!  No Sir!
It's busted.
We're gonna get outta here, Buzz -- Buzz?
But you're Irish!
There's no mirror.
I did like the music.
A sin against <i>what?</i>
He can take out his smile and keep it on a shelf, but, his bite is worse than his bark, isn't that so, old fellow?
She got away.
I didn't know about the puppets. It's a lot to take in, all at once.
Do what?  Oh, I see.
You're not so old yourself!
I've got a present for you...
H'm?
What difference does <i>that</i> make?
Nothing is left but us.
We're too young.
Juliet who?
It's all right, Finn.
Judge Wakefield, it's an honor to handle it for you.  Consider it gone away.  She's a minor; it probably would've expunged on her 18th birthday anyway.
Well, you know, he's going to say about Madrigal... and Salazar.
I want to believe you.  I really do.
Arnie, thank God.
You're gonna get through it, but the first thing we do is get Michael Adler to represent Carl.  We get Adler and we beat this thing.
I suspect he'll accept his payment in publicity.
What about legitimate businesses? We own a construction concern, real estate --
Don't you have some good news?  Isn't there something positive you could say.
I tried, Arnie.  And, I will continue to try.
I need an introduction to the Obregon Brothers.
What are you thinking, calling me at home with a message like that?  You've compromised me and our relationship --
It's the same.  What happened to what they gave you?
I have a drink before dinner to take the edge off my day.  That's different.
No, not yet.
Honey, your father knows the President.
Not yet.
I don't know.
How long's the job?
Fuck you.  I wasn't doing anything. You're like the Gestapo.
Like I give a fuck.
Yes.
Maybe we could show up and smoke a little rock with them to unwind --
Have you done your homework, honey?
Then here's a little bump.
Nope.
Winners don't do coke.  Or haven't you been reading the bumper stickers?
Depends who it's from.
You can learn a lot about somebody from this stuff.  Three categories: you like me, you hate me, you want something from me.  Definitely third category.
No --
There's always a way.  If people get to the Pope or the President, you can get to him.
I am a legitimate business.  Fishing boats.  Tuna.  Check it out.  Tax records, everything --
I got greedy.  I decided to bring a little in on my own and somebody tipped you off.  That was my mistake. Carl would never be so stupid.
When the DEA gets into the narcotics business, then we'll stay at the Four Seasons.
Yes, sir!
Yes, sir!
It should be... It's yours.  I want our debt forgiven.  I want to be the exclusive distributor of Obregon Brothers Cocaine for the United States.  And I want the principle witness against my husband, Eduardo Ruiz, killed.
That's crazy.  My husband is on trial for smuggling.
Go home.  Get cleaned up.  Get to work.  Salazar is heading down to Mexico City next week and I'm not getting left behind.  Don't fuck this up.
We keep our mouths shut.
Where?
No.
An informant.
What is it you want me to do?
Everybody has a weakness.
Which part, getting terrorists loose on bail or freeing convicted murderers on technicalities?
Noriega is a criminal.
Last I read your clients were chopping people up with chainsaws and delivering illegal narcotics into this country.
She hasn't called you?
I don't know what to say.
The West End.  We buy it off the streets.  I can stop, you know, and she can't. Two people, really similar, we can talk about anything, but for me it's like a weekend thing, then I get my shit together, and for her it's different --
You want to help?  Stay the fuck away from her.
I can't believe you used to bring my daughter here, to this place.
Addicts treat themselves... they overdose and then there's one less to worry about.
Right.  Now it's used by somebody from the Juarez Cartel, one of his lieutenants...  Who knows?  Every damn day there's birthday party. At first I thought they must have three hundred children, then I realized they're taunting us.  Three miles away and we can't touch them. Ha, ha, ha.
What kind of research?
You daft cunt. If you're going to waste it like that, you might as well leave it all to me. Now get the drinks in.
You've stabbed me, man.
But it's not worth more than fifteen.
Sorry, mate, I'll get you another.
Look, I'm sorry, I didn't mean it.
I'd fucking kill you.
Diane.
What?
think I left something back at the -
No argument. You can sleep on the sofa in the living room, or go home. It's up to you.
No, not holding hands.
Is that a promise, then?
Smells like it.
Iggy Pop is not dead. He toured last year. Tommy went to see him.
What do you think -- I should be carrying a torch for you?
Eh? How's that?
Indeed, yes, those halcyon days.
Oh, yes, indeed. I look back on my time there with great fondness and affection. The debating society, the first eleven, the soft know of willow on leather --
Of course, the motto, the motto --
Exactly. Those very words have been my guiding light in what is, after all, a dark and often hostile world.
No.
No problem.  No problem -- easy to say when its some other poor cunt with shite for blood.
Yeah.
Right.
It wasn't my baby. She wasn't my baby. Baby Dawn. She wasn't mine. Spud's? Swanney's? Sick Boy's? I don't know. Maybe Allison knew. Maybe not. I wished I could think of something to say, something sympathetic, something human.
No, he didn't make me touch it.
You're all hear.
Well, it's up to you.
Sure, sure. I've heard it before.
Your favourite dish.
No joy yet.
I've got balls like watermelons, I'm telling you.
That's fair enough.
So what's it going to be?
No. Well, yes. I have to admit it: I'm a perfectionist. For me, it's the best or nothing at all. If things go badly, I can't be bothered, but I have a good feeling about this interview. Seems to me like it's gone pretty well. We've touched on a lot of subjects, a lot of things to think about, for all of us.
This starship, could it carry my wisdom beyond the Barrier?
He doubts me.
Bring it closer so that I might join with it. Do it, or watch these puny things die horribly.
Rescued at last.
Estimating destination in 6.7 hours, present speed.
Enterprise, this is Starfleet Operations. Come in.
Jim...? Well, we're dressing informally, aren't we?
The power was within you.
Join my quest.
Aye, Captain  How many times do I have to tell you? The right tool for the right job...
I hope it won't come to that, Mr. Scott.
Then we'll have to get them out the old fashioned way.
Yes, Spock?
He reminds me of someone I knew in my youth.
What do you mean?
Why?
Fascinating.
If I had pulled the trigger, Sybok would be dead.
Technically, you are correct. I do not have a brother.
He did have pointed ears.
A "t."
It must be all those marsh melons.
It's all right, Captain.  Proceed.
Welcome aboard, Captain.
I was thinking of Sybok. I've lost a brother.
Given to me by God.  He waits for us on the other side.


No. You must save yourselves. Forgive me, brother. Forgive me.
Tried to.  Can't quite make the connection with that sucker, though. If I had a direct terminal ...
"Embezzling" is such an ugly word, Mister Bailey...  No, actually I'm trying to get a legal brief together.
Yeah...pain in the neck, you know, I was all set
For being on to Dillinger.
Yesssss. Yes. Yes. Yes.
Oui, da, yessiree, sure 'nuff, you betcha.
No, nuh-uh, never in a million years!
It's our friend the boy detective. He's nosing around again.
I would if I could find it. it's stashed somewhere off in the system ... out of my range. Meanwhile...
I'm afraid so. I spotted him this time and kicked him out, but he's getting trickier all the time.
There's a 68.71 percent chance you're right.
What do you want with the Pentagon?
The MCP is the most efficient way of handling what we do. I can't sit and worry about every little user request that --
They may be... de-rezzed... on the carrier ... hurry...
The name of my User, yeah. But how... ?
Yeah, I... oops!
I'm sorry, Tron... he's... he didn't make it.
Look, you guys know how it is. You just keep doin' what it looks like you're supposed to, even if it seems crazy, and you hope to hell your User knows what's goin' on.
Shhhhh.
Oh, I was an actuarial program... worked at a big insurance company. It really gives you a great feeling, helping folks plan for their future needs -- and of course, if you look at the payments as an annuity, over the years, the cost is really
The tower, yes -- Flynn, have you remembered anything else about yourself -- like what sector you're from?
Alan-One...
Come here.
Little more juice's all it needs...
Swell...I'll log us both on, and you can get your Tron thing running...
Well, just don't forget your old friends when you're rich and famous.
We'll get them, sir... These things take time.
Oh, Tron... I knew you'd escape... they've never built circuit that could hold you...
That's all going to change, Yori...
Power surge... the transmission beam's too strong!
So I guess you didn't get away					* for the weekend after all?					*
Where are you going?
I'm not a pumpkin!  Okay?!!  Do I look even remotely like a pumpkin?! I'm not a muffin, or a cupcake or a honeybear either! And you don't understand anything Dad...
Fine.
Yeah, right.
Why?
This is impressive, gentlemen. Of course, it would have been even more impressive if you actually knew where he was.
In the helicopter.
Don't be ridiculous.  She's only -- how old is she?
Right.  She's only fourteen.
Nope.  The art buys are in a separate ledger.
Okay.  Here she comes.
Goddammit!  That's outrageous.
It can't be.  Not Helen.
It can't be.
Sure, Harry.  I'm on it.
Wait!  Calm down, Mrs. Tasker. There is only one more question.
Here they come.
It's show time.  Don't look at					* the flash.  Do not look at the flash.
Sorry.
But you didn't.  Why not?
No!  Never!
Very good.  It's sixth century B.C.  Do you like the period?
Oral hygiene?
Yeah.  It was great.
My husband the hero.
They must've just missed me.
Oh, sure.  Fine.  I'll get some more gravy.
I don't know anything about a faction.  I just met Simon...  or whatever his name is...  a couple of weeks ago.  I barely know him.
Well, maybe a little.
He wanted me to go with him on a mission, to pose as him wife.
What did you need?
Think carefully.  You will be lying to the man you love.  The person who trusts you the most.
No.  Doris.
What?  Oh, the flat tire?  Yeah, I thought the damn towtruck was never going to get there.
Yup.										*
Go down there and kill everybody, I guess.
I told the guy---  I told the guy, this isn't even my order.
Dance?
Sure.  Set me up and then don't tell me.
Some kinda legal secretary of something.  Married to some boring jerk.
Red hot.  Her thighs steam.
No, my dear, he is a federal agent.  He killed two of my colleagues the other night.
You recognized my style.  See, you're very good.  You're a natural at this.
Three of them.  Hardly worth					* talking about.  Two won't bother				* me again.
What is it you need me to do?
We're going to Paris?
Use the gifts that Allah has given you.
Hello, Alabama.
You can't have just one.
How come?
Don't eat anything.
Ya looked through it?
He can't. We gotta go, but he wants you to read the letter. The letter explains it all. He wants you to know he loves you. And he wants you to know that as of tomorrow, all of your money problems are over.
Now hang up.
And here we are.
Want some Goobers?
I thought Sonny was the good guy.
My name is Clarence, and what is yours?
What do you want to know?
At the movies?
What would make you think that?
You know, a lot of people have misconceptions of how she died.
Uh-huh.
I'm not a theater checker. I'm a call girl.
I'm a call girl. There's a difference, ya know.  I don't know. Maybe there's not. That place you took me to last night, that comic book place.
He thinks he is. He says his mother was Apache, but I suspect he's lying.
How do you do, Mr. Worley?
Of course. Are there others, Mr. Worley?
I just gotta get somethin'.
You don't know him -
Yeah. But to be honest, I put myself in that position. When I drove up there I said to myself, "If I can kill 'em and get away with it, I'll do it." I could. So I did.
What?
It's got a nice ring to it. It sounds like a movie. "Clarence and Alabama Go to Cancoon". Don't 'cha think?
That rhymes.
In fact, I'm gonna show you what I mean with a little demonstration. Big D, toss me that shotgun.
So you do eat pussy!
Then shoot 'em. Shoot 'em in the face. And feed that boy to the dogs.
Killin' 'em's the hard part. Gettin' away with it's the easy part. Whaddaya think the cops do when a pimp's killed? Burn the midnight oil tryin' to find who done it? They couldn't give a flyin' fuck if all the pimps in the whole wide world took two in the back of the fuckin' head. If you don't get caught at the scene with the smokin' gun in your hand, you got away with it.
Can you develop an ulcer in two minutes? Being cool is hard on your body.
I'm her husband.
You got it.
Well, you're gonna be seein' me shortly.
Get the fuck outta here!
Ask him if he got the letter.
Well, she's a pretty amazing girl. What are women like out here?
Drexl's dead. This is Clarence's coke and Clarence can do whatever he wants with it. And what Clarence wants to do is sell it. Then me and Bama are gonna leave on a jet plane and spend the rest of our lives spendin'. So, you got my letter, have you lined up any buyers?
Where?
I'm just makin' sure we got everything.  You got yours?
In case they try to kill us. I don't know, what do you want me to say?
He trusts you?
No. No you're not.
A Norms in Van Nuys.
We grew up together.
She seems very nice.
Clarence, just shut up, you're giving me a headache! I can't believe how much like your mother you are. You're your fuckin' mother through and through. I haven't heard from ya in three years. Then ya show up all of a sudden at eight o'clock in the morning. You walk in like a goddamn bulldozer... don't get me wrong, I'm happy to see you... just slow it down. Now, when did you get married?
Do you still have friends on the force?
I'm your son.
Look, goddamnit, I never asked you for a goddamn thing! I've tried to make your parental obligation as easy as possible. After Mom divorced you, did I ask you for anything? When I wouldn't see ya for six months to a year at a time, did you ever get your shit about it? No, it was always "OK", "No problem", "You're a busy guy, I understand". The whole time you were a drunk, did I ever point my finger at you and talk shit? No! Everybody else did. I never did. You see, I know that you're just a bad parent. You're not really very good at it. But I know you love me. I'm basically a pretty resourceful guy. If I didn't really need it I wouldn't ask. And if you say no, don't worry about it. I'm gone. No problems.
I give up. Who are you?
I've heard of Blue Lou Boyle.
No.
I'm talkin' about a massacre. They snatched my narcotics and hightailed it outta there. Wouldda gotten away with it, but your son, fuckhead that he is, left his driver's license in a dead guy's hand. A whore hiding in the commode filled in all the blanks.
McTeague.
Well, don't just sit there, shoot him.
Look, we don't care if you bring in the state milita, the volunteer fire department, the L.A. Thunderbirds, the ghost of Steve McQueen, and the twelve Roman gladiators, so long as we get credit for the bust.
Not a tiny little vial -
No don't sit here and feed us some shit.
This rabbit'll do anything not to do time, including wearing a wire.
How the fuck could he know?
Nigger, you lie like a big dog.
- Because it's good!
You must be high. Uh-huh. No way.
Read my lips.
Exactly room-mates.
No, I ain't been there. But I heard him say. Hollywood Holiday Inn. Kinda easy to remember.
Are you Dick Ritchie?
Donowitz, he said.
I went to the surface and I collected specimens like I was told.
I DON'T WANT YOUR "WOMEN," YOU BRAINLESS TWIT! I WANT TO BE WELL!
No, sir!  I just want to do my part. To get us back on top...in charge of the planet.  And I have the experience, I know who the people are...
It won't help you.  You can't do anything about it.  You can't change anything.
They wanted identification.  I don't have any identification.  I wasn't trying to hurt them.
July?!
No, 1995 is the past.
1989.  Six years for you.  There's the sign!  Right here!
You told me you'd help me.  I know this isn't what you meant, but...I was desperate... no money...bum leg... sleeping on the streets. I probably smell bad.  Sorry about that. But then I saw your book in a store window with a notice about your lecture.  I can read, remember?
You'd prefer that? ... James...you don't really have a gun, do you.
When I was a kid I identified with that kid, down there alone in that pipe...a hundred feet down -- doesn't know if they're going to save him.
I'm not going to "do" anything, I promise.  But you need help, James. None of this is what you think it is.
I've got one now.
I'm..."mentally divergent".  I would love to believe that.
We're avoiding the police until I can....talk to you.
I think I saw a TV show like that when I was a kid.  Where a boy...
You... you left them a message?
They got your message, Kathryn.  They played it for me.  It was a bad recording...distorted.  I didn't recognize your voice.
If we can't change anything...because it's already happened, then we ought to at least smell the flowers.
I was here...as a kid.  I think you were here, too.  But you...looked just like you look now.
Right!  You're right.  I have to fix this.
No!  Look, I don't belong here!  What I need to do is make a telephone call to straighten everything out.
Scientists.  I'm supposed to report in to them.  They'll want to know they sent me to the wrong time.
No, no.  I can't talk to them.  It's called, "voice mail".  I'm supposed to leave messages. They monitor it from the present.
You know -- your plan.
Not, "what", babe!  When!
Well, the guard woke me up.  He told me I volunteered.
And what we believe is what's accepted as "truth" now, isn't it, Owen?  Psychiatry -- it's the latest religion.  And we're the priests -- we decide what's right and what's wrong --we decide who's crazy and who isn't. ... I'm in trouble, Owen.  I'm losing my faith.
You really want to know?
You want to go in?  Examine him?
All right, old man.  Christ.
Christ!
What do you want for free?
I'm a little short. I'll catch you next time.
Ain't over yet.  Night is part of day; separate, but equal.  Night is when you let your guard down; when you see things in the shadows and hear things in the dark.
Night is when you want to sleep, but the dry heat keeps you tossin' and turnin'.  It's when you wish the sun was bakin' high in the sky so you could see what it is you're afraid of.
Afraid of it?  Boy, I live in the dark.  People are afraid of what they can't see.  I can't see nuthin', so it's all the same to me. Kiss from a beautiful woman, a lick from a dog.  The kiss of death. It's all the same.
More or less.
We all got plans.  I planned on seeing all my life.  I know you didn't plan on straying into town.
Hundred and eight already.
It is not.
I got more brains than you've got teeth.
I need a ticket.
I . . . Mexico.  You got a bus that goes to Mexico?  That's where I have to go.
'Cause Harlin used to own it.
Just a car.
Well . . . parts, labor . . . let's call it a hundred-fifty bucks.
Hundred-fifty.
That's about an hour and a half longer than I usually spend looking for parts.  You're the one thinks that car's so damn fancy.  What you expect but fancy damn prices?
Listen, Darrell, about that hundred- fifty bucks for the car, as soon as I get where I'm going I swear I'll--
What?
You said this morning the hose was going to run me one-fifty.
I didn't tell you to replace any gasket.
Listen you stupid fuck, I want my car.
Open up!
Honest like Al Capone on tax day. Where are my keys?
You got beer?
Yeah, give me the Miller.
John--
Wrong number.
There's someone in the house.
The wind isn't blowing.
What does it look like?
What are you afraid of?  I'm the one's got the gun.  Stay here.
I don't know your real name.
You sure you can manage?
I saw these in the Penny's catalog, and I just knew I had to have them. You ever seen something and just knew you had to have it?
'Course they cost a little more than I should really be spending.  But, damn it, I don't hardly ever do anything nice for myself.  I deserve nice things.
I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to.
A little of this, a little of that. Mostly I tell fortunes.
Come here.
What?
Like they're made of polyester.
I have ideas.
Really?  And what game did you want to play?  You carry my box for me, and I fall into bed with you?
If he says that's what happened, Jake, it must be true.
Yeah, I guess you're right.
You just walk away.
You need a meal ticket is what you mean.  Some guy you can latch onto just long enough for him to get you out of here.
From here?  I don't know.  Far.  Far enough.
You think Jake's going to give me money just so I can take you out of here?
One-hundred-thousand!?  That son-of- a-bitch lied to me.
What about us?
Except I can't get you out of my head, Grace.
What was I supposed to do?
I don't know.
Don't yell at me!
There has to be!
We're going all the way.  Together.
Not me.  Us.
You could give me the gun.
What difference does it make?  You killed Jake.
Grace!
You closed it, didn't you, Grace?
And you're not one to lie, are you?
Yeah, they'll find you.  Dried up and twice dead.
Didn't much look like you were hanging drapes.
A lot that means.
Accident.
Yeah, I know.  More careful.
John Stewart.
My car overheated.  I pulled in to have it fixed.
About things.  About your wife.
About what you said this morning.
I did?
What makes you say that?
How do you put a price on murder?
Make it twenty.
And next time, next time somebody is going to get dead.
Maybe you heard old Jake's got some money stashed away and you thought you'd help yourself to a little.
And then with Jake out of the way you could borrow two-hundred dollars.  Or maybe two-thousand.  Or twenty-thousand.  Who's to stop you? Not Jake McKenna, 'cause old Jake would be dead.
You know what kind of woman Grace is.  You know how badly she wants to get the fuck out of Sierra.  What makes you think when you were planning on killing her she wasn't doing the same for you?  What's she to you, Jake; a woman who would have you dead?  Let me kill her.  All I want is two-hundred dollars to get out of here with.
I said come on!
Accident, and yeah, I got to be more careful.
She's dead.
I've had time to get over it.
I wasn't going to fight for you.  I was just going to beat the shit out of your boyfriend.
Get it through your head, little girl; I'm not going for you.  If this Toby likes you, then if I were you I'd marry him.  You're not going to get much better in this town.
Stand up.
What the hell are you doing?  Are you crazy?
You stupid punk!  You don't even know what you're fighting over!
I'm leaving.  You never have to see me again.  Just please, give me the ticket!
What happened?
I guess.
Is there a problem up the road, Sheriff?
No!
But, Senor--
Yeah, sure.  You got change?
Difference between you and me, old man, is I see the glass half full, you see it half empty.
So, we're all just floating along like twigs in a stream, so enjoy the ride.  Is that it?
Mister, I'm calling you out.
Stand up.
I'll give you a lift, son. Too hot to be walking... People die out here, y'know.
Yeah...
Yeah, I know.  More careful.
That's a solid name.
Like you don't know.
I did?
What makes you say that?
And what does that make you?
You love her, but you hate her?
I'm not your boy.  I don't like you.  I got no choice but to do business with you. Let's just call this a nasty little marriage of convenience.
No!
Damn it, Jake. There is a guy coming to kill me, and if it comes down to me or Grace, then I pick Grace.  You were going to give me thirteen-thousand.  Give me two-hundred.  I'll kill her and dump the body where no one will ever find it. She showed me the perfect place. There won't be enough left for an autopsy.  But I need the the money.  I've got to have the money.
What are you talking about!
Cause she's dead.
Oz.
For what?
What the hell are you talking about?
Get away from me!
Nope.  Darrell.
Doubt it.  He's dead.  The Look Out's a cemetery.
Yep.
Damn.  Gonna be another hot one today. Sometimes I don't even want to get out of bed. Course don't want to get out for the cold one's neither.  Then of course the clouds come in...
Darrell--
It's your radiator hose.  It's busted.
Gotta run over to the yard and see if I can find a hose like this one, or close enough. Gonna take time.
Time.
To replace a goddamn radiator hose!?
About an hour and a half, because that's all the longer I've been gone.
It might as well be fifteen-hundred dollars, because I don't have the money.
Yeah, well, I've been around the bend a bit.
I didn't tell you to replace any gasket.
What sign?
What reputation?  You're nothing but an ignorant, inbred, tumbleweed hick.
Listen you stupid fuck, I want my car.
Yeah, like Al Capone on tax day. Get the keys?
Eh?
Hablar slowly, por favor.  My ingles no es bien.
I'm just going to my car?
All over.  Chicago, Houston, Detroit.  Just lately Dallas.
I guess I've got wander in my blood.
Come here.
It tells me what every face tells me. Everybody has a past, they have a pain, and they have something they want.  What is it you want?
I have an idea.
Really?  And what game did you want to play?  You carry my box for me, and I fall into bed with you?
Maybe I like to find out about a man first. Maybe I like to know what he's made of.
Still playing?
You know what I want.
You could leave him.
Walk away.
Try me.
Jake hides it. In a safe. In the floor. In the bedroom. He counts it. He loves to sit there and count it.
At night. He just sits there and laughs and talks to himself and counts it. I heard him. My Mom told me he had a hunnert thousand dollars down there. Maybe more.
Oh yeah. There's nothing else with Jake. He don't trust banks. He keeps the money in the floor right under the bed. He loves it so much, he wouldn't think of spending any of it on me. I never seen it but I know he's got more than a hunnert thousand at least...
If the key's on him, how do we get the key?
I don't think we have anything to talk about.
Because I know you're full of shit.
Is that what changed your mind?  The money?
I ... nothing.  I just stubbed my toe on a rock.  Hurt like hell.
It should be just up ahead.  Hold on ... there!  There it is!
Can't we just dump him fast someplace?
Then will you take me on your friends' boat with you?
He was in love with you Grace. He would've done what you wanted, you could've made a deal and ...
I was just baiting him! Bobby, I had to tell him that to get his guard down. Just like you told Jake you was going to kill me!
I don't want to go to Mexico, Bobby! Please, I really want to be with you. Don't blow this. Don't you think I care about you?
And love's a funny thing.  Sometimes I don't know if I want to love you...
Harlin's.
Yeah, fell down and hit a rock. Not as bad as it looks.
Sounds like it. I wish I could help Sheriff, but I just want to get my car and get on up the road.
And that's not the half of it, Mr. Arkadin...
Where to?
But, in particular?
No.  Just plain ol' Miller. Now you can fuckin' take it or you can fuckin' leave it.
Morning Sheriff. Got my drapes.
Oh?
They look nice.
I picked them out for you, Jake.  I thought you would like the colors.
Yes, yes, hit me...beat me, please.
There's someone in the house.
Vat? I am going 5 miles an hour! I am looking town. I not even moving.
I have a lock on the door.
I don't want to drag this out too long for Jeremy.
Do you remember me getting sick?
Megan, do you ever remember me getting sick?
No that's it.
Jeremy what the hell are you doing?
My turn. What's your favorite song?
What was that?
It's finished. I won.
I don't know Megan.
The life of an idea that has lived too long in my head.
You thought he was carrying a knife?
You're skill.
It's an exaggeration of the truth. Maybe it's based on something as simple as instinct. Like being able to touch someone and tell whether they've done something wrong... Or the level of what they've done wrong.
One last question.
I never said you couldn't be killed. I never said that.
We are.
What's he look like?
Send him packing. I'm not walking all the way over there.
There's a message for you at the office. Your kid was hurt.
Just one--
No.
Okay.
...See my husband was a big football star in college and we were in an accident together. Our car flipped on an icy road. We were both injured. He couldn't play football anymore.  If that hadn't happened, we wouldn't have been together.
I believe comic books are based loosely on reality -- I believe there are real life equivalents of the heroes in those books that walk the earth -- I believe your husband is one of those individuals.
I'm not going out anymore. I'm not getting hurt again. This was the last time. I told you.
On account of they seen you was beatin' on their friend.
Innocent of what?
Thank God.
What wife? He don't have no wife.
I wouldn't point no pistol at nobody, sir.
Down the street and across. Greely's Beer Garden and Billiard parlor. Just ask for Alice and say you want a game of billiards.
Little Bill come out of Kansas an' Texas, boys. He worked them tough towns.
Didn't give us nothin' but his own name... Ned Roundtree.
On the Bar T... looking for... them.
Three days. Are you hungry?
Yeah, I guess.  There's still a payment, ain't there?
Your wife?
Oh.
I guess not, Bob. I don't like guns around.
Those cowboys messin' him up?
I... I guess I might... but like I said, I ain't armed.
N-no. I wr-wr-wr-write... I wr- wrwrite...
A book, huh?  I guess that means you can read... An' I guess you boys seen them signs about surrendering your firearms... But then, like you told old Andy there, you ain't armed, are you, Bob?
Uh... Duke.
Well, Mister Beauchamp, I was at the Blue Bottle Saloon in Wichita the night English Bob killed Corky Corcoran... an' I didn't see you there... nor no woman, nor no twogun shooters nor nothin' like that.
But he was called...
You... you mean...  English Bob killed him while...?
He will be hurryin' and he will miss. That there is as fast as I can pull an' aim an' hit anythin' more'n ten feet away... unless it's a barn.
Oh.
Wasn't nothin' said about no partner.
No.
He's my partner. He don't go, I don't.
What business?
You still think he's in there?
I can't see 'em.
Shit... I thought they was gonna get us. I was even... scared a little... just for a minute.  Was you ever scared in them days?
Yeah.
H-hell yeah. I killed the hell out of him... three shots... he was takin' a sh-sh-shit an'... an'...
Well, you don't wanna trust me too much. We'll take Ned his share together so you don't figure I run off with it.
I thought you wanted to buy spectacles an' fancy clothes an' all.
You sure you ain't armed?
Yeah.
Who was next? Clyde? Or was it...?
Eleven.
You was a... a crazy sonofabitch.
You ain't like that no more.
You ain't like that no more.
Yeah.
Naw. I bumped my head fallin' off of my horse.
Beats the hell out of me.
What he was talkin' about... how them deputies had the drop on you an' Pete...
I remember how there was three of them deputies you shot... not two.
He's dead, Bill.
Listen, Bill, I'm gonna see what's takin' The Kid so long. Must be he's gettin' an advance offa them sportin' ladies.
Ned... Is that you, Ned?  Ned, I seen... death.
Well, that's good now, ain't it, Bill? Seein' Claudia an...?
We got to kill this other one first.  Shit, Ned, if we're lucky, we could kill him by nightfall... or maybe tomorrow morning. Then we could head back, all three of us, with the money.
Tom?
Tom? Only how... how if you didn't... didn't come back in a week...  how we was to take half the money to Sally an' say you was...
Who said that?
Oh, them.  Hell, I seen them.
He's blind, for Chri...
He ain't as tough as you, Kid.
Well I guess Bill Munny wasn't no fearless killer an' bank robber like he said.
Just like that?
&lt;&lt;Are you sure?&gt;&gt;
Just forget about it.
Edie, please. I don't want to hear this right now. What did Renault and Fortier say?
No. It's never going to stop, period. It won't take more than a week before every investor in this city is walking away from us. It's finished. I'm finished.
I don't know what you came here for, but we won't have any part of it.
This whole thing was a shakedown.
So why the hell was I hauled in and cavity searched tonight?
You are a criminal.
RIGHT THERE. FREEZE.
How do I know that? How about it, pretzel-man? What's your story?
What do you care what he says?
Dig.
Can we stealth these guys?
Yeah, I was gonna tell you to shut up.
Verb - Roger, this is Edie Finneran. Edie, this is Roger Kint, he was at
Well, I'm sorry.
Maybe more.
Who's your boss?
Don't jerk me off. We all know what this is. You don't work with me if I work with you without knowing who I'm working for. Now let's cut the shit. Who's the man?
Mr. Soze will be most -
We know you can get to us, and now you know we can get to you. I'm offering you the chance to call this off.
Edie Finneran. She is upstairs in my office for an extradition deposition. I requested she be put on the case personally. She flew out yesterday.
What'the fuck is that?
Keyser Sate or not, if Keaton's alive he'll never come up again.
Waste of time.
You know damn well what I think.
He didn't have my lawyer.
He loved her.
Let me tell you something. I know Dean Keaton. I've been investigating him for three years. The guy I know is a cold-                    + blooded bastard. L.A.P.D. indicted him on three counts of murder before he was kicked off the force, so don't sell me the hooker with the heart of gold.                        +
Convince me. Tell me every last detail. 52    SCENE DELETED                                                              52 53    INT. HOSPITAL - DAY                                                  53                         + Kovash's room is now filled with people. Jack Baer stands next to DANIEL METZHEISER, a balding man in his forties. Next to him is Doctor Plumber. Across from her is Ridgly Waiters.
Keaton always said: &quot;I don't believe in God, but I'm afraid of him.&quot; Well I believe in God, and the only thing that scares me is Keyser SOZE.
So why play into his hands? We can protect you.
I don't
He used all of you to get him on that boat. He couldn't get on alone and he had to pull the trigger himself to make sure he got his man. The one man that could identify him.
Weapons. Misdemeanor one.
Abrams...
Neither does he.  That's where he loses.  This man's scared to death to go to court.  We only have to call his bluff.
Yes.
Yes.
...almost nine minutes...  causing brain damage.
And you would come here, and on a slip of memory four years ago, you'd ruin their lives.
That is correct.  I was engaged to render an opinion.
Just as you are, Sir...
Meth...Methodology and Technique...
I am seventy-four years old.
I'm on the staff of...
...one moment, Mr. Concannon...
No.
Yes.
You've just said you signed it.
Is that what a good doctor would do?  How old are you, please?
Easthampton Hospital for Women. Excuse me, what is that, a joke? Let me tell you something, Doctor, those men at Catherine Laboure. Men who are known not only in this city, but the world, were trying to save a woman's life.  They were there, and here you are, four years later, read some hospital report, and say...
Actually, yes.  It's by no means bad, I...
Well...
The Doctors were not negligent.
From what I've seen, Mr. Galvin, you have a very good case...
Yes.  I wrote it.
Yes?  Galvin, right?
Why?
Whose side are you arguing ...?  I thought that you wanted to do something.  I don't have any interest in the woman's 'estate' -- No offense, but we all know where the money's going  to ... I have an interest in the Hospital;  and I don't want those bozos working in the same shop as me.  They gave her the wrong anesthetic.  They turned the girl into a vegetable. They killed her and they killed her kid.  You caught 'em.  Now: how many others did they kill?
What are they going to do?  Not invite me to their Birthday party ...?   Look, I gotta go.  I have to be in Cambridge ...
Okay.  I'll meet you here.  Tuesday night ... I gotta go.  You going my way?
I understand.
And ask me what?
I don't owe them a goddamn thing.
You know, you're pushy, fella...
This is a complicated case, your Honor...
Thank you, your Honor, I'll continue.  Dr. Thompson.  Did you examine Deborah Ann Kaye last night at The Northern Chronic Care Facility?
What?
I understand.  Thank you, my name is Galvin.  I'll be at the following number in a half an hour.  It's urgent.
My subscription lapsed three years ago...
We get it at work.  We get the magazine at work.
My ex-husband was a lawyer.
What...?
They, uh, they got to my witness.
Dr. Gruber's not in.
He's not in, Sir.
One lousy letter eighteen months ago. . . .I try to throw a fuckin' case your way ...
You use their witness.
Read me what she said.
... You saw her?
Yes.
I, what are you talking about?  I talked to her this morning, and she said...
...everybody.  Mike says, `Pat, you mean to tell me for a buck you get a free lunch and a beer, and then you go in the back and get laid?'  `That's correct.'  Mike says, `Pat.  Have you been in this bar ?'  Pat says, `No, but my sister has ...'   Everyone.  Buy yourself one too.
Yes, the roving nurse...
We, we were rather busy...
Huh.  And why is that?
No. We have ways of digging out knowledge. But it takes longer. He is suffering from acute melancholia, together with a guilt complex. He blames himself for what happened to the woman. And we know little of the background.
San Francisco's changed. The things a that spell San Francisco to me are disappearing fast.
No, I'm all right.
No... no, thanks. A bit early in the day for spirits.  Well, I guess that about covers everything, doesn't it? I never married; I don't see much of the "old college gang"; I'm a retired detective -- and you're in the shipbuilding business.  What's on your mind, Gavin?
From whom?
I'm not making it up. I wouldn't know how. She'll be talking to me about something, nothing at all, and suddenly the words fade into silence and a cloud comes into her eyes and they go blank... and she is somewhere else, away from me... someone I don't know. I call to her and she doesn't hear. And then with a long sigh she is back, and looks at me brightly, and doesn't know she's been away... can't tell me where... or why...
I can get you a firm of private eyes to follow her for you. They're dependable, good boys --
We're going to an opening at the opera tonight. We'll dine at Ernie's first.  Which is easier?
There are things you didn't tell me.
What happened?
What for? Who are you?
Do you live here in the hotel?
Your name. And --
But you haven't lived here long.
I'll take care of you.
No, Judy, you don't understand.
No.
I just want to see you as much as I can!
Yes.
No.
Why?!
No, I don't want any clothes! I don't want anything! I want to get out of here!
No, Ernie's is fine.
I need you.
Take me away...
You can't. You're afraid!
Too late... too late... there's no bringing her back.
Oh, of course I remember that!  But then I must have had a dizzy spell, and fainted!
I will. You're terribly direct in your questions.
You're not. Merely direct. What were you doing there? At Old Fort Point?
Oh! Yes! Here!
No, I wouldn't like that. And after what happened today I should think you could call me Scottie. Or even John.
I wanted to drive you home. Are you all right?
What?
We have.
Good-bye.
Well... anywhere in particular?
Of course not! I'm a wanderer!  I'd like to go somewhere I've never been!
I don't like them.
Long ago...
I didn't jump, I fell! You told me I fell!
What?!
Yesterday.
And so explain it away?  But there is a way to explain it, you see. If I'm mad? That would explain it, wouldn't it?
But clear... so very clear... for the first time... all of it...
There was a village square, a green with trees... and an old whitewashed Spanish church with a cloister. Across the green: a big, grey, wooden house with a porch and shutters and a balcony above... a small garden, and next to it, a livery stable... with old carriages lined up inside.
Too late... there's something I must do...
It had to. We're in love. That's all that counts. Madeleine --
I won't lose you.
Please answer my question.
What is her name?
How long has she had the room?
Does she sleep here? Ever?
I saw her come in five minutes. ago.
What car?
Ah, Johnny-O...
I've never run across one like that.
What a pleasant hobby.
Three whole weeks.
Gavin? Gavin Elster? You'd think I'd would. No.
He's probably on the bum and wants to touch you for the price of a drink.
Well, who? Come on, you know everybody.
Not that kind of history. The small stuff! About people you never heard of!
Yeah.
Do you know him well?
Wandering.
What does a big old wooden house on the corner of Eddy and Gough Street have to do with her?
How?
How soon can it be altered?
Can we have it by tonight?
We're gonna get caught. I know we're gonna get caught. They were eyeballing my car.
What did you say?
First of all...
Multiple reasons.
Why?!
It's sacrilegious.
You're pathetic.
Don't you fucking threaten me - I'll fucking kill you.
You go home!
You want to hear me out?
What?
I'm calling the ambulance.
Calling the ambulance.
So I didn't fucking do it!
You don't think someone will have a problem with a body being thrown off a balcony?
Open the suitcases, unpack the body parts and reunite the limbs.
What does that mean?
At the seven-eleven.
I don't give a damn.
Don't ever stare him down.
What happened? Oh my God...
Jesus Adam, can we not get into this now please?
Yes money. Adam had a five hundred dollar Term Life Insurance Policy.
Don't sweet lip me.
I will call the police right now if I don't start getting some answers.
So who's the lucky guy?
The groom?
That's the whole point. They rarely work out. But on occasion they do. And when they do, they do big.
Give me two more.
He's fine. Okay Mikey, let's go.  You guys stay here.
Prison Communication Systems.  An acquaintance friend of mine is professionally involved with a communications outfit in Denver that I just happen to know for a fact is about to be rewarded a very large, exclusive contract to rewire every state prison in Colorado. Yes sir.
What's insane is the fact that Micheal here put a fucking girl's head through a toilet. That's insane.
Good God...Good God...
I'm calling the police.
However it goes, the point is, nobody says anything to anyone ever. Right? ...Right?
He is not cracking up.
What is the question you asked me?
Say it again.
Suck my ass.
Yeah.
Now?
I'm getting really tired of your bullshit.
You're sick.
You said one in two marriages end in divorce.
They have a president. A Benjamin Yahoo something.
The Israelis can protect themselves. They got the Mossad thing happening. Mossad's for real, man. They scalp babies.
What?
Not really, no.
You said nobody would miss her.
How about my Fatburger?
I don't think so.
Sent it.
I'm not playing around. I forgot.
Because you wanted to. You wanted this to be your wedding not your parent's.
You know how important this is to my mother. You know that.
It amazes me how organized you and your little fun bunch can be when it comes time to mobilize to Vegas.
Well it's bad timing.
David Boyd is a big sack of hot gas.
You don't like Moore? Since when?
He's weird. And I expect more from you.
It's vile!
I've seen it on television.
Problems?
So what do we do?
Honey I don't have the time...
We're leaving in three hours.
I'll call them from the road.
More than I ever imagined being able to love anyone ever.
I will.
I love you.
I'm working on it, I've made three calls.  I can't stop thinking about how much I love you.
Well I do.
I'll see you tomorrow...
Well, can you come back inside?
Can we just talk this out?
We're not canceling.
Do you love me?
At the newsstand on 3rd.
Buzzing?
Have another drink.
No. No. No. This is my doing. You see I'm gonna have my wahoo spark for my own. For Lois and the kids, for my brother, for Franco. I'm gonna turn myself in. I am all that. I'm gonna do it for sweet Lois.
How do you know she's dead.
My God...
I'm saying it's luck. All luck. You work your entire life, all the training, focus, all the dedication, all irrelevant. Where does the ball bounce? My father spent his whole life trying to start a company, practiced every day, worked like a dog, finally got enough money. He's paid the dues, he's ready, does all the market research, picks his shot - "Pup Corn."
Where?
That's what I'm thinking.
It was an accident!
Fish, I'm really sorry. I just...I owe you man.  Desert.
You'd like me to kill them?
Yes, yes.
Let me go, Don Amalio, I'll tear her apart.
What's that?
You'll think you're still at the convent.
No.
Who is she?
You are spoiling me too much. I won't know what to do with myself when you've gone.
Nothing. I didn't say anything.
How could anybody behave like that?
Then it's penance for you who are going to be a nun; and for me, who am old, it's death ...
Whatever you like.
No, it's true.  Last night when you were sleeping, I had you all to myself.
But sir, what can I say to her? And why should she pay any attention to what a servant tells her?
But what can I say to her, sir?
It's only that ... It's all very odd, sir.
Thank you; but it's missing something.
Run and get something to mop it up with, quickly.
That your cousin is more to your taste.
If you free me, you'll be a rich man ...
Where's the dough?
Are you Jorge?
I'm not like you, you have your wife.
I'm not sure yet. I've had a shock recently, and I'm only beginning to get over it. Perhaps I'll go back to the convent one day.
I'll take him to the doctor tomorrow. Come on now, sit down and go on eating. And you, look after him as if he were a sick brother. Be understanding. Now finish eating and then go to bed. Everyone in bed by eight o'clock!
Stop this!
Is anything the matter, Mr. Mayor?
Where?
I'm afraid.
This louse is looking for trouble.
But, miss ...
In any case he's asking you to come and stay with him.
The retreat will start soon. You can leave tomorrow morning.
Mother.
I've had a gutful of this.
Yes, yes, I saw you!
It's not your fault. We appreciate you trying.
Madison lives two blocks from their present location.
You already have staked your reputation.  Mayor Bennett and I have been friends a long time. Since Grimes tried to kill him, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to come to the conclusion that Sid 6.7 might go after him, too.  Bennett's Re-Election Rally is tomorrow night and we already have enough trouble on our hands with one psychotic on the loose.  The fail-safe on—line, yet?
What about them?
I've seen worse.
What she's going to do is get in my way.
Where's my gun?
Then I guess we're even.
Don't blame yourself. In your shoes, I don't think I would have told Parker, either.  So do you think Grimes has become the dominant personality?
Got it.
Call off the manhunt looking for me. I didn't kill the transport guards.
No, but I've confirmed the reelection rally is the target.  How much C-4 is missing?
I was assured the problem was corrected.
Neither will the public.  The media has caught wind of his pardon. Unless Mr. Barnes starts giving me some tangible results, I'm going to put him back in his cage.
I understand... I understand perfectly.
This is supposed to be years away.
How do you kill it?
What I need is a nymphomaniac.
Show me his physical sensory level.
Turn it down!
Talk so I can understand.
I think I understand what you have in mind...
I'm begging you...please don't kill me! Please!
I know. I was there. I saw the whole thing.  If I was your therapist, I would have advised you against putting yourself back into that kind of situation.
What was going through your mind when you killed the busboy?
I don't have to do anything except survive. And it's taking everything I've got just to do that.
He had a twin brother who was a musical child prodigy who died in an electrical accident at age eight. Lindenmeyer went into an emotional shell until was 17. All he did day and night was play the violin.
Every music school in the country rejected him and he turned to computers.  Stay here.
Hamlet.  What's David Berkowitz got to do with Sid 6.7?
Creating a whole far more dangerous than the sum of its parts.
Give me a goddam break. I'm not going to go anywhere alone.
How did you get your hand out?
Thank-you.  Her name is Karin.
This is my area of expertise.
I'm doing the best I can!
Start of what?
You like baseball?
Sid 6.7 told me after he killed the two guards. He suggested I kill you rather than him.
I told you before, Grimes liked to be obvious.
A bomb's going off tomorrow night, but I have no idea where.
You won't want to watch. Turn around.
Performing solo.  Enjoying the concert so far?
DEAD! YOU HEAR ME?
Let me put it to you this way... whether I'm here... or whether I'm not...I'm leaving an indelible mark on the world tomorrow night.
I've got some final preparations to take care of—— Checking his watch, he stops suddenly.
As long as you keep overpaying me, I'll be the first to go into production on three, and four, as well.
Mr. Wallace, I could have 10 of them ready by tomorrow.
For Schumann.
We've just found out They Have the Bomb.  We've Just Found Out They Have The <u>Bomb</u>, aaaand... No, No wait a second, no, no, wait a second, No.  The Bomb's not... it's not <u>there</u> -- because they'd have to have a rocket and that shit n'they're a buncha wogs-- it's ... it's a <u>suitcase</u> Bomb.  Ooookay.  It's a <u>suitcase</u> bomb, and it's .... in Canada!  Eh?  Albanian Terrorists have placed a suitcase Bomb in Canada, in an attempt to infiltrate the bomb into the USA.
...and he's got a <u>negative</u> rating of... 
What can it hurt is they offend me.
I need a little bit of <u>help</u>...?
Hi, How are ya?  <u>Listen</u> to this, willya...
Come on.
John Levy, Staff, and Amy Cain, Press Off....
Who's got the story? 
Well, yeah.  Now.  That's not good.  <u>Okay</u>:  <u>Okay</u>.  We'll set up the War Room <u>Here</u>...
I'm working on it.  Same time, you call Billy Scott at Joint Chiefs, and pour him onna plane <u>right now</u> to Seattle, y'got that...?  All flustered and worried. To talk to the <u>Boeing</u> people.
We don't need it to prove out.  We need it to <u>distract</u> them for two weeks til the election.
I'll be back within the hour.  Now,
Yeah, I'm gonna have to go to L.A.
Lookit, don't worry about it.  It's not a New Concept. Wake me when we touch down, will...
The American "people"?
What did they find out about the Gulf War?  One shot: one bomb, falling though the roof, building coulda been made of <u>Legos</u>.
Why <u>not</u>, what've they ever done for <u>us</u>...?  Also:  they sound... Ah, you see, this is why we have to mobilize the B-2 <u>Bomber</u>...
...you want us to go to War with Albania.
In the yellow ribbon.
<u>Hello</u>... Yes.  We'll be back...?
... they're checking the ratings...uh...
Anything at the Airport?
Knock on wood.
Yeah...what was I talking about...?
...Stanley Moss...
The War is Over.
First of all, we're locked <u>in</u> to it, <u>secondly</u>:
No.  No...Pentagon says, Army's got'em, they got'm in ..."Custody"... 
It's the Pride of a Job Well Done, Stanley, yes, but it's <u>more</u> than that.
Uh...Didn't we <u>do</u> this?
...what are we going to do...?
Well, what do you want to do about it?  What do you...
I know who you are, Mr. Ames.
ON THE MEN, IN THE ROOM, ARGUING ABOUT THE ILLEGAL ALIEN, SCHUMANN IN THE B.G.
ON BREAN, WHO IS DOODLING.
...how ya feeling, boy?
Well, let's not be too sure, why is that?
Where is he?
Well, I'm not interested in how long its "got to hold for."
I have a question for you.
...you the Press Office?
What do <u>you</u> think?  What I need from you:  I need a base of operations.  Some place in the District.  I need some clean <u>money</u> ...
Then show a little spunk.  There <u>Is</u> no B-2 Bomber, General Scott, the best of your knowledge, is not in Seattle to talk with Boeing...
You're goddamn right.  And it's got nothing to do with the B-2 Bomber. 
I'm here, Mr. Moss, because you've shown yourself a great supporter of the Party.
...holding action.  THEY'RE GOING TO TEAR THIS GUY TO <u>Shreds</u>.
That's from the ... it's got to be from the...
And <u>if</u> you never won an Oscar, How'd you like an ambassadorship... 
Well, no, well, you couldn't <u>tell</u> any...
...that's what it is.
"Freedom."
...it's a Teaser!
No, King, I need you here <u>yesterday</u>...  How long do I need him for?
The men and women of Detachment Three-O-Three, with their...
The War is Over.  Senator Nole just ended the War.
I saw it on TV.
Oh, he's gonna be Aces.
Of what?
...the Albanian Campaign.  This... this is history...
They insist they wanna go with meeting him at the airport.  I told'em they're wrong, I can't convince'em. They're concerned that the last kid had the <u>Wheat</u>. Variations include, the kid is a <u>boy</u>, the kid is <u>twins</u>, it's a little <u>dog</u> ... they rub meat on Schumann's cuff, the dog runs to him...
Yeah, well -- it's only one word difference.
Yeah, well, perhaps...  Speaking of which:  I have a <u>prescription</u> here, I'm going to give you the <u>number</u>, I need you standing by with a <u>crate</u> of the stuff.... it's ... what is it?
Leav't alone.  Wha'd television ever do to you?  Ate your <u>life</u>, ruin'd your <u>Culture</u>, but...
We're going home.  We're going home together...
"...unsure whether or not Enemy Action..."
No.  You're right.
Why are they ...
Military Special Programs... <u>Programs</u>... No, I am not Shouting at you, I'm... I'm sorry.  Anyone named <u>Shoe</u> Schumann?  <u>Schuster</u>... uh
Surest thing you know.
...they... <u>you</u> know...
...their Leopard Skin Berets....
Yes. 
...this is nothing.  This is nothing. D'you ever shoot in <u>Italy</u>?  Try three Italian starlets on Benzedrine, this is a walk in the park...
Show some compassion.
...'bout ready to Mix it Up...?
Sell it all.  What the hell, so I'll only make ten million.
Sounds like a french word, what is it?
Mr. Lynch, I swear to you, he's lying!
...takes years of genetics, pal, and a Yale education... and the right tailor.
You mean teach you how to play. Can't. Going fly fishing in Canada, big client...
Thanks, Marv, with that I might be able to qualify for welfare.
Hello, Natalie -- guess who? That's right, and you know everyday I say to myself, today could be the day... So what do you say... will you marry me? Then please can you get me through to Mr. Gekko?
Now! Tell everyone to dump!
Coulda been a contender.
Dad, it takes time. You gotta build a customer list. I'm doing it. I could make more money in one year as a broker than five years at the airline.
It's Queens, Dad and a 5% mortgage and you rent the top room--I gotta live in Manhattan to be a player, Dad. There's no nobility in poverty anymore, y'know. One day you're going to be proud of me, you'll see... 
Not in here Dad... please. Later.
How's Mom?
Sure I'm sure. Buddy, you got that mischievous look in your eyes. You used to smile just like that when you were a baby sleeping, just like that.
I met them before you were born.
No, what I see is a jealous old machinist who can't stand that his son's become more successful than himself.
That's because you never had the guts to go out into the world and stake your claim.
What are you doing here?
Stay here, I'll see what I can do.
So you say. Nice to meet you; hope you're intelligent. Like these, how'd you get these? 
...I can't even see it...
No sir, that would've been illegal...
Mr. Gekko, I don't think I can...go on.
I remember that deal. You were involved?
My firm needs your signature on these option agreements tonight, sir, otherwise we could take a real bath tomorrow.
...Gordon.
How much?
I think I got some friends that won't mind making some easy money...
I'm sorry, this can't wait.
I found out about the garage sale down at Bluestar. Why?
Tell me, Gordon--when does it all end? How many yachts can you waterski behind? How much is enough?
How much is enough Gordon?
You could have a great beach house for that.
I gather you're a decorator.
Upper West Side.
It's not me I'm worried about...You know Darien, the only reason we haven't slept together is because we both know we will -- and not knowing when was the only surprise left. You owe me, I want you, what else is there...but you, me, the world.  ...right here...make love to me...now...  Stop me if I'm going too far.
So did I, till I hit 19 and found I had all the royal habits and no throne. Mom got by but I had to go to work just like you. Only the skills I had were shopping and making friends. So...that's why I do what I do, what makes you tick, Buddy?
I'm not gonna let it happen Darien.
Why?
...how do you know? You wish...
Jesus, can't make a buck in this market, country's going to hell faster than when that sonofabitch Roosevelt was around... too much cheap money sloshing around the world. The biggest mistake we ever made was letting Nixon get off the gold standard. Putney Drug--you boys might want to have a look at it.
No, are you crazy? And I don't want him ever to know. Do you understand?...
Now tell me, why would I want to do that?
With Mark?
It's eleven forty-five let's go
About what?  About us.
I'm sorry I'm not that good at languages ok?
Hi
Hmm.
It's all rather morbid though isn't it?
Too late for that sir.  Give my love to the misses.  Get those bastards!
Hello, Mrs. Webster.  Is China there?
No?
They seemed, closing by much 
Vell.  Goodnight.
I've always wondered why someone would believe in something like that.
No I'm serious.  It's. it's just I don't know I. I'm looking for something else.
Listen Sarah, I think I know what's going on ok.  I went to the waxwork today.I met this man.
Who's is all this?
Maybe before the event, never after.
Oh! The virgin has spoken! SARAH Stop it!
It's only two hours away.
I'll come back all the time.
So much.
No.  But once I heard...
Because, I don't know, because sometimes...sometimes I forget things...and ever since Caitlin left, ever since my daughter left for school, there've been...I fainted and...  Why is this so hard?
Can't hurt.  And I think it's important you find out what she wants.
You were in an accident?
Ohhh yes.  No, no.  Just a little, you know...We're fine.
That I'll just...that one day I'll just...disappear.
Um...sure.
No.  No, I don't.
I should be going anyway.
Biology.  She wanted to be a doctor.
This is...
Good.  I'm good.
Kambucha mushroom tea...
So you'll have some later.  Notice anything...different?
Listen, I've gotta run.  I just thought I'd stop by and see if you want to take the boat out, say Thursday morning?
Please.  That's all I need.
The planchette?
Shhh.
M-E...
Mrs. Feur.  She's alive.  I met her. She's really sweet.
No.  Jody, listen to me.  You have to listen to me.  This is not something that I can do right now.  Whatever it was, it's gone.  I need it to be gone now.
I was down in Adamant...
Artsy little village down seven.  There's a guy there who sells my work.  I had just dropped off some paintings and as I got in my car...I saw Norman sitting at this little cafe.
All of us.
Like what?
We'll be quiet.  Quick and quiet.
Don't.
Genetic repair mechanisms in eukaryotic organisms.
Mmm.
I'm telling you.  There was something in her voice...
Not like this.  We were never like this.  I want to go over there.  After dinner, we can--
But what if something happens?
I'd never be able to live with mysel--
Look, I'll call Harvey Tomes in the Psych department, see what I can find out.
I'm stuck here for another couple of hours.
Unless you need me to come home...
In the house.  I was scared.
Norman, you are so funny about that.  No, I didn't.
What?
What am I looking at?
What do you mean?  Claire, we talked about it.  You didn't want Japanese, I said, Our first date since...
...since Caitlin.  You don't remember this?
What can it hurt to talk to someone?
...and I don't think I'm some lonely, middle-aged woman cracking up.
Claire, please...
No, it's fine.  I'm fine.
Good.  You sat in front...I saw you there...
...Please stop...
Why don't you shut up and fuck me, Professor.
Who?
Oh God...
And then out of nowhere, some bright young woman found me attractive...
You should have tried harder.
We don't know that for sure.
I don't know, but I am.  She was there and then she was gone.  I felt it.
Incredible.  We should take a drive before they're gone.  Spend the night at some cozy little bed and breakfast.
What?
You don't have to do that.
:No, I said, I hate what I'm doing to Darcy. Oh, boy, men are stupider, it's true.
But you've not told Michael.
Lasher is my legacy - not Michael's.   Aaron, I've seen the pain in Michael.  I can't bear to see anymore.   He's not to know.  Swear to me.
But why would they do that...?
Rowan's already called the hotel, Michael.  At the cemetery by now, I would guess.
You sound certifiable. Yon know that.
What are you talk---
You have to warn her - this second! I'm catching the next flight back!
Diedre Mayfair was your mother.
Yes.    Listen carefully, Rowan. Have your attorney contact me at once. There are matters of immediate -
Other properties as well - here and in Europe.  And vest holdings - in sugar, oil, gold, electronics.  Liquid funds over eighty million.  tmpcssible to put a figure on it all. All yours now.
Why are you doing this...?  Handing out these horrors! Why...?!!
Wind - I love you with that which is endless within me.  Bring me your eyes - your touch - your voice...
I am only what you are --- what all of you have been.   what do you think of yourself now, my love...?
Go away!  I don't want you here.
I LOVE MICHAEL.  MICHAEL!!
I don't know what you are!!!
How is your heart, Father...? Is the Timex still ticking...?
Rowan...
I guess so.  The trick is remembering how to act like one.  I'm glad you called, Mr. Curry. I wanted to see you.  Why don't we go to my office...
As far as touching things, yes. But the vision - that keeps pouring into my head-    It won't go away God - if I could just understand it.
I'll bet you say that to all the women who bring you back to life and then seduce you.
It - it feels like - like I'm being filled up. crowded out of myself.   Like I'm fading away-
And whose houses do you design...?
Just sit there and soak up the vitamin D.
Captain's orders.
Is this the part where you try and talk yourself out of how good this is...?
God knows, I'm intriguing.
What about you coming down here...?
Yes.  I love you.  Very much.
They need doctors in New Orleans too.   Michael - think what I could do with the money!
Mm-hmm...
No.    This is unreal...
A little sore.  Darm...   Finish up my section, will ya...?
A bit much.    Lucas.
What were you talking about...?
Hi.    You - you wanna get some breakfast...?  Maybe see a movie...?
You bastard!
The guy I told you about - Aaron...?  He says I can learn to control them. That I could lose the gloves at some point.
Left behind...?  This about Rowan...?
Comes running out the front door - down the walk to them. MICHAEL seems to pull inside himself. Cool.  Aloof.
Why don't you take a few weeks off - you're due some holiday time.
BRIAN...
Oh really - you must remember me from when I was a regular customer.
Yes - I have had it for years.
Yes, one and a half please.
And how many people have you killed?
You don't know?
my car  I stopped working from my car.  She could have stopped me you know - If she really wanted too. That is the difference between the confusion of humanity and the purity of the beast - If a dog attacked you - you could easily kill it without any damage to yourself - Why then do people get bitten by dogs - savaged? Why?
You know everyone accuses me of being sick - the press, the TV - but I'm not you know - they are - I don't watch it for entertainment every night - I don't sit and watch it whilst eating my dinner - they all say, how could he cut her up? She was dead - I can't hurt something dead - And all this whilst they slobber down their processed beef burgers by the dozen - I couldn't eat one of those burgers, you don't know what has gone in them! 
I don't know...
Why should I feel sorry - they're dead.
I have something I have to show you...
I am ashamed of what I have done ELLEN. When I read what you had written it made me think - look into myself - I haven't dared look into myself for a long time - I have stopped ELLEN, I can't carry on - I won't carry on. All I want is to start a new life - I want a second chance...You are good to me - you don't condescend, you're intelligent, and very beautiful...
Open it...
I am sorry...
There isn't that much - you didn't even taste it - What's wrong - don't you like my tea?
You killed my friend!
I don't know - it's your house ELLEN
And not just any novelist - a great novelist - it was an impressive piece of work ELLEN...
I'd really like it if you would come round some time - Then I could cook you a meal - what do you say...
Yes - one please.
Maybe he got promoted.
Wait a second, I thought we were hamburger guys.
Perv.
I'd call you a sick, twisted fuck. But this is different.  She wasn't your mother mother--
With a refrigerated cargo bed full of sirloin tip.
These are real, live women?
Do it?
You have changed since second grade.
Dad, please.
Remember how you struggled through that whole facts of life talk and then found out I knew more than you?
I guess we could go to Disneyland or something.
Dad, let's just say I can buy anything I want in the whole bookstore. Including the bookstore.
I don't even know if I should be doing this. It's a very expensive car.
Some of them have to be automatics.
I always knew there was more. I felt it.
Hmmm?
Before we knew it, we created the most popular men's magazine in the entire nation. The rest is history.
Everything.
You mean they knew who I was?
Well, Jay. They've been exceptionally supportive.
Why can't we have pot roast or stroganoff or even a little London broil? I mean, for god's sake, we own a grocery store!
You can't come back. That is, you can, but your things will be in the room you currently think of as mine.
I meant biologically.
Look Ted. I'm cool with everything. You've long been dissatisfied with our mediocre little town. You've always had an itch for the good life. I'm happy for you. This couldn't happen to a nicer guy.
Your article sucked.
That's not ENTIRELY true.
Interesting.
Is this an gritty exposé or a candy ass press release?
And this is not my first time on a private jet, so quit acting like I'm Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm.
I doubt it.
It's incredibly simple.
I know.
Then you won't mind covering that watermelon seed spitting contest next week...
Well? Where the hell are you?
You expected whips, chains, Merk being cattle-prodded by some dominatrix in a leather hood?
Amen to that.
My desire betrays me, like goosebumps on my flesh.
I had a Portuguese boyfriend who could read the phone book and melt me.
Not a chance.
I know, their small town mentality can be maddening.
You're quick. I like that.
I'm not going anywhere, Ted. You're the one with the champagne wishes and caviar dreams.
Very ambitious. I like that.
I know where you can find any number of naked girls who'd love to hop on board.
I graduated from college. Did great, summa cum laude and all. And I'm about to launch a brand new magazine called "EXPOSED!"  An homage to Miss Julie Conroy of Xenia, Ohio.
You better.
No cursing in this house, young man. Use the strong vocabulary God gave you.
Did you have a nice flight?  Are they taking good care of you?
Everything is lovely, Ted, but much too expensive.
Like what?
We cannot afford free speech if it excises the moral fiber of this community!
Our state has a zero tolerance policy for underage drinking.
Of course I like girls.
Indeed it is. During the day, visitors prefer to be outside, au naturel. As it were.
I was like a different person tonight.
You think we should be more open minded?
In other words, our scope is too narrow.
That's perfect.
I'm Ted Nelson. I guess you already know that part.  For two years I've been the editor of the high school paper in Xenia, Ohio. I've won some awards, made a difference. I've always had journalism in my soul. Now I know why.
It's about your parents.
I have the feeling, they got it down already.  They're a step ahead of us, Artie.
Eat a power bar.
Senior class fund-raising gig.  I told 'em they could hose down the Jeep.  Hey, come on.  It's for a good cause.
We can get blood type right away. Dental records will take longer.  You want DNA, that can take weeks.
What about the blood?
And the child...
Take your time.
Was there penetration?  Did he put himself inside you?
That's okay, Kelly.  You're doing fine.  But I have to ask you something here. When you say it hurt.  Was this the first time a man was inside you?
I... he had my wrists pinned behind me. I remember my hands were cold.'
Not at first.  He was still inside but he wasn't moving or anything...  He said we had this secret.  And that now he'd be able to help me... because we were close... Something like that.  I don't know.  It's hard to remember, exactly.
You could tell me where you were last night.
Suzie?
All I'm saying is, I think we should go slow here.
Yeah, well, Van Ryan got his.  I don't imagine he gives a shit now.
You mean Camp Sixty-Nine.
The swamp, most likely... Lombardo's a swamp rat, knows the body will never be found there.  But he's made a mistake.
Ray, you heard him...
Where's Lombardo?
The blood type on the rocks matches Suzie's.
Yeah, maybe, a little.
I think she's acting.  I think she set it up to be alone with him because she wanted him to come on to her.  I think maybe she's upset that he didn't...
What about witnesses?
And what do they say?
Get off this Ray, now.  If there is any evidence here, it's for Homicide.  You get an ID, you call me.
Yeah... okay... he did
I wanna go home now.
I said he did.
I'm sorry?
Your Honor... Please...
Hey, man, at least in study hail I could meditate.
You and Suzie used to come out here together?
Are you retarded, or just brain dead from whiffin' fumes out there in the swamp...
Curiosity, I guess.
You're out of your mind.
I'm not on your property!
Where, the mall?
Aren't  you forgetting something?  Your coupon.  We gotta have it.
About six and a half million dollars.
Stick?
Hello.
Yeah, he got her busted for possession...
Ken.  I'm in some trouble.  I need an attorney and you're the only one I know. So I figured I'd start here.
You can tie whoever did it to Sandra Van Ryan...
Not in here.  Chiropractor comes in here for lunch sometimes.
I was just thinking about where I'm gonna stay.  I lost the house.  It's like waking up from a goddamn nightmare.
Will they?
You got something against cigarettes?
That's cop bullshit.
That's right.  That was his name.
Story's the same, Detective...
In cutoffs, a wet T-shirt.
Well, shit, you're the cop, they don't teach you to disarm people, shoot them in the leg or something?  You weren't supposed to kill her for Christ's sake.
Put Kelly on too.
Are you mad at me?
The guy was history when he killed Kelly.  You knew that.
Fuck the winch.  I wanna drive.
Yeah, real funny.  You're wrong about this, I could get busted on the spot.
I'll bet.  Look, Sam.  Why don't you come by this weekend.  We'll take the boat out...
What?  Running over alligators with that silly swamp jalopy when you could be sailing a real boat...
Shit. Here we go again.
Goodbye, Sandra.
Well... it's the only one I have. It's gotten me out of quite a few tight spots...
At least the thing's not that fast. We just follow it.  Whenever it stops, we're there, waiting.
What way is that?
You'd think if Loveless is going to kill him he could at least be a prominent citizen.
That rules out Willard, Vermont; Willard, Minnesota...  Willard, New Mexico?
Relax.  We're almost there.
I adjusted it.
You said it popped out too easily. Nothing's ever good enough for you, is it?
What?  President Grant is...!
I'd love to stop him, but have you noticed the hundred armed men?
Thank you.
Where have you been?
What is this?  A whole new train?
My Lord, he was telling the truth!
Well, see, he had this little wagon when he was a kid...
I get that feeling.  You know, Mr. Tyler, I'm the kind of woman who doesn't believe men are much more than a complete waste of time. But after spying you across the room, I'm tempted to suspend my disbelief, at least for the evening.
My friend?
Of course, sir, that's why I've assigned a new man.  And he's no ordinary Marshal.  He's quite sophisticated.  Three college degrees.  A master of disguise. Speaks French...
Exactly.  Any number of nations would love to cripple our scientific growth.  And what better way to tip the scales in their favor than by killing off the greatest minds this country has produced.
On my way to Denver...
He didn't.  That's your job.  I'm taking you off that other case until you've nabbed this lunatic. Good luck.  Nice train.  But mine's nicer.
He had a pressing engagement.
So, I'm the only one here who can tell the difference between an Emperor and a murderer?
Who was this partner of his?
A glass eye?  That's who it was! One-Eyed Jack Garrison.  Otherwise known as General Garrison, Confederate Third Army.  I saw him at Dr. Loveless' party, but I couldn't place him.  He used to wear an eye-patch.
They're rounding up a posse.  Figure an hour?
Right.
He thought you were a woman, Airk!
You managed alright.
Then come with us.
No I'm not.  Have you really looked at me?  I'm short!  Even for a Nelwyn!
Not today, Willow.
If I'm not strong enough to be your apprentice, how can I do this?
I don't believe you.
Madmartigan.
As above, so below.
Are you okay?
These burns.  My arms.  Ouch...
I hate this.
I will.
Time to leave.
Because she's sick.
Madmartigan!  You saved her life!
Yes it does.  The Fairy Queen told me.
My help?  A great magician like you?  You don't need any help.
Well what did she say?
Madmartigan, you promised me you'd take care of Elora Danan like your own daughter.  She is all that matters.  Are you going to abandon her?
Daikinis are giant people who live far far away.
What a great son you are, Ranon.  I wish I could take you with me.  Now go to sleep...
That's all I ever wanted!
As below, so above.  You hold the univers, Willow, in your hand.
Burn it to a fine ash.
Me!
His will.
More!  More!
No!  I can still defeat Bavmorda!
Surrender!!
Us??  We'll never catch them.  Any- way, we're all done, Teemo.  Let's go home.
Ouch!  Let go of me!
Who is he?
No!  You let us handle this.  Come along, Rool!
Take your time.  Don't worry about the elves.  They won't come out here.
Hurry!  Queen Cherlindrea will know what to do.
How are we going to get out there?
The sorceress.
Maybe milking.
Guess I'm not used to so much.
Sorry. It's important.
Upstairs, asleep. Where'd you think?
Yes, sir.
Who'd you see?
No... I saw the man who killed him.
You don't say.
Got to, Sam. You and I are going to a courthouse together, put some people behind bars.
The Amish boy saw him, Paul. I'll make it, but Set Donahue and the Homicide Department off my back or they'll blow the whole thing.
Well, anyway, don't get crazy.  I'll do something for Zenovich's wife.
I hope you don't have any doubts about that.
Just us.
Samuel. Samuel Lapp.  But what happened here is none of his affair. My sister is expecting me... our train is leaving soon.
The problem is I don't happen to think my son should be spending all his time with a man who carried a gun under his coat and goes around whacking people.
What's a 'good' tired. Tired is tired.
Listen, I'm the cop that polices the police. I'm not in the business of protecting crooked cops.  I'll make an arrest when I know everybody involved.
Gunshot... they'll file reports... they'll find me.
Very interesting. I'm learning a lot about manure.  What's that?
Hochmut?
Anything against zippers?
Quaint? Can't imagine why.
I know what he said.
Oh?  What happened to Hochstetler?
Not long... A few days.
Where's my baggy pants?
What the hell are you talking about? What's happening.
Wrong.
He accused John of taking kickbacks. And you know – anybody who knows John – knows that's a goddamn lie!
Yes, thank you very much.
Aganishish? Yeah, that sounds like John.
You just wouldn't. It's not the Amish way.  But I think it would have done me good if I could have screamed at your brother last night.
His name is John Book.
You are acting like one!
No! They will be the judge of that! And so will I... if you shame me!
I don't think she knows.
Lady, I'm here to help you. This man is very dangerous. An armed criminal.  He's got a gun, hasn't he?
Dorothy, please!  We're trying to count! Fifty-eight--
Oh, but he doesn't do it every day -- just once or twice a week.  And he can't catch her old cat, anyway. And now she says she's gonna get the sheriff, and --
There, there, lie quiet now.  You just had a bad dream.
If she...
If any!
You'll be hist...
The Wizard - The Wizard - The Great and Powerful Wizard of Oz - Oz - Oz-Oz - Oz - Oz - Oz - Oz!
Do you presume to criticize the....
I don't believe you!
I can't come back!  I don't know how it works!
Well, gee, I try and have a heart.
That was her sister -- the Wicked Witch of the East. This is the Wicked Witch of the West.  And she's worse than the other one was.
Yes.  Say goodbye, Toto.
Then close your eyes, and tap your heels together three times.
Oh, no, I wanted to go along with you.
Well, I -- I can't quite see.  Why, she's crying.
Destroyed?  Toto?  Oh, you can't!  You mustn't! Auntie Em!  Uncle Henry!  You won't let her, will you?
Did you say something?
Oh...
Oh, see - I killed it. Oh, I killed that poor little honey bee!
Still, I wish I could remember.   But, I guess it doesn't matter anyway.  We know each other now, don't we?
What sort of an animal is that?
Oh --
Oh --  Goodbye, Lion.  You know, I know it isn't right, but I'm going to miss the way you used to holler for help before you found your courage.
Lions and tigers and bears!
You're right -- I am a coward.
Look!  He's rusted again.  Oh, give me the oil can -- quick!  Oh-oh, quick!
In another hour, I'll be King of the Forest. Long Live the King!  If....
But why?  Why?
It may be just a cricket Or a critter in the trees.
Are you gonna stand around And let 'em fill us full of horror?
I have so got brains.
Oh, Hunk, you just won't listen, that's all.
Ohhh --
They would?
You're going to see a Wizard?
Yes -- that's true.
Oh --
Oil can?  Oh -- oh, here it is!
Oh, you don't think we're going to stand by and let her get away with fireballs and bees, do you?
I don't see how.  You weren't around when I was stuffed and sewn together, were you?
Oh -- here quick -- oh! - we'll oil him up.
Looks like we came a long way for nothing.
Ohh!  OHH!  OHH!
The slippers -- yes.....the slippers!
It's too late!  There they....
I'd show him who was King of the Fores'!
Don't stand there talking!  Put me together! We've got to find Dorothy!
I -- I -- I -- I -- gotta get her outta there?
All right, I'll go in there for Dorothy -- Wicked Witch or no Wicked Witch -- guards or no guards -- I'll tear 'em apart.  I may not come out alive, but I'm going in there.  There's only one thing I want you fellows to do.
Oh - I was only trying to help. Ohhh!
This way!  Come on!
Hold still - hold still --
It's a whatzis?
I hope your tail holds out. Oh --
You don't neither --
Not nohow!
You mean she bit you?
To Oz!
Don't cry -- you'll rust yourself again!
Yes.
It's a whozis?
It makes you nervous?
But I still want one.
Help!
So who are you?
Makes her look even more innocent.
He’s going to insert the plutonium.
So isn’t it time you unwrapped your present?
The worm on the hook again.
Haven’t you heard the news?  So is she.
Perhaps Sir Robert had a word with the Man Upstairs.
It’s my father’s pin. He wore it everyday of his life.
It’s not the pin your father wore. It’s an exact duplicate. Inside is a tiny electrical detonator. We have reason to believe the assassin had an inside accomplice, someone who worked at this company.
It’s the only way out...
...you should rest.
I used my body on the guards.  It gave me control. I got to a gun and I took my chance.  I’ve never told anyone that.
He used your exact words.
He killed me! He killed me the day he refused to pay my ransom.
How does a terrorist like Renard supply his men with state-of-the-art Russian Army weapons?
You are out of your league.  She’s working with Renard.
The right kind of explosion in the right spot -- it would block the Bosphorus, cut off the Black Sea.
Please.
Someone will come.
It’s heading for the oil terminal.
Still no contact yet.
Small army, from the looks of it.  He put up one hell of a fight.
Hnnrr.  -- Like to masturbate.  Shit once a day.
God isn't there to do it.
Hello, Adrian.
We've lost a colleague.  The Comedian is dead.
Oh?  The CTU suspects a Libyan hit squad.
. . . And just how would you manage that?
Then you're sleeping with Dreiberg?
Yes, I loved you.  I left the earth when I lost you.
Because --
Please, Laurie.  Not yet.  I've got eons stretching before me, a universe to explore.  I'll be alone.  You're the last human being I'll ever see.
Us.  You mean the Watchmen.
Maybe not, but why take chances?
His . . . whatever.
Not at all.  You look very -- dashing.  Here, you pick one.
Are you kidding?  If they put him in jail he's dead.  He'll never get to trial.
I know what you're thinking.  You'd be a lot safer if I weren't around.
Will you two lovebirds keep it down?
What now?  Fly south -- hook up with Adrian?
Trying to change the past.  He said it was the only way to save the world --
Toilet clogged.  Short fat turd.  Let's get out of here.
Veidt's a fool.  Tried to warn him about new information.  Sicced his mangy cat on me.
I don't think she's coming with us.
Don't know.  Nothing I can think of --  -- outside of a nuclear blast.
He's the one.  He's been the one all along.  Stalking us.
-- What?
Oh sweetheart, just a quick one.
Isn't it true that you --
I don't know their real names!
I'll take a raincheck, Laurie.
I know.  I shouldn't be saying this.  He's happy, he's content, he's doing his work --
Edgar William Jacobi, aka William Edgar Bright, a.k.a. Moloch.
Don't know.  Ask around.  I'll be back.
Ever see one of these before?
What is that ungodly smell?
That shows me already that you don't have a clue. What's it to you, anyway?
..If you're trolling around for narcs, man, have you got the wrong guy.
You want the cheap backstory? The runaway mom, the suicide dad and the foster homes? Gimme a break. You're not interested in my past, you're interested in my future as some kind of spy.
I'm not interested. I've already got a job.
There's some folks I want to keep tabs on. Dirty, tattooed, uncivilized. Your kind of people.
If you find out what I want to know, and if I'm able to successfully use that information, you get to go back to your degenerate little life. If not, you take a bath.
What's with that "X" on the back of your head? Does that mean you're "extreme"? I've got some news for you, Mr. X, you're a three time loser. So maybe you should tattoo another couple of X's on your head.
One point two million dollars? I did not authorize you to spend one point two million dollars!
Yes it does.
Somebody else makes those decisions, not guys like you and me. You've done your job, X, head back to Prague. I'll be landing in 90 minutes. This is my operation now.
But I hate cops, remember? Except for her.
Oh yeah? Why don't we start by taking this thing off my ankle? The poison needles?
No needles, huh? What about the acid bath?
Oh, I don't know. It was an accident.
Slick graphics, huh? See these dudes? They're called "Anarchy 99", they're the bad guy bosses.
What do you get if you finish?
Yorgi asked me to.
Why are you still hanging around? Your business is finished, you should go home.
I don't know who you are or where you come from, but I don't like you. You ask too many questions.
You've got to relax, baby, you're paranoid.
Let's just say I'm freelancing and leave it at that.
Don't judge a comic book by it's cover.
The people I know want facts, the kinds of things an insider would know. They're interested in putting Anarchy 99 out of business.
It's a long story, but yeah, more or less.
When this is over, we're just gonna take off, the two of us. Take a vacation.
Perhaps he is not all he says he is.
I'd forgotten how exciting it is working together.
They come in any other styles or colors?
It's a stakeout suit. It's got food, water, recording gear, anything you need for covert spying. It's all- weather, fire retardant, and if you give this buckle a sharp pull, the whole outfit deploys into a parachute.
You run around with maniacs jumping motorcycles in the desert, you break 36 bones crashing wave runners and snowboarding off cliffs, all with no health insurance... It's insane, I can't take it anymore.
I've been on a plane for twelve hours, I think I'll stand.
This pizda? Never seen him before.
He flashed his badge to half the bar when he bought his drink.
Sorry, man, don't know what you're talking about.
Ferrari's, Lamborghini's... high end pasta rockets. Ten to start.
Of course.
Had to do what I had to do.
How you gonna do that with government and rules everywhere?
Connections and politics, it's the same everywhere.
That's alright, I'm kinda tired.
Easier than that, buddy. I'll get them to destroy each other. You kill an entire Peace conference, someone is going to have to pay. Then our friend Ahab continues down the river to the ocean and begins his world tour. London, Cairo, Beijing... Pretty soon everyone's involved. These guys bomb those guys, those guys invade these guys. Soon the whole world is like your wild West cowboy days. No rules, no law, everybody free to do what they want.
... until he found tungsten.
Into the Hudson?
I'm sorry.  I'm not strong enough.
You know, you --
I won't light the cigars - how about that?
What if they're naughty?
I can assure you, there is no such creature in my genes.
You think I care about her?  I'm the only one who's sure to walk out of here.
I'll go.
What do you want with him?
Still trying to make the world safe for our kind.  Still trying to find a way to introduce ourselves -- definitively.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN TO DO?
Herr Falkstein -- you must go at once and present Dr. Frankenstein with all the details of his inheritance.  The estate will provide for your journey.
Poppycock!
What lecture could be more important than the will of Baron Beaufort Frankenstein?
Yes, sir.
MMMmmmm.
MMmmm.
Of course.
Oh, nice.
Yes.  I am a bit tired, after all.
Of course I am.  Now come along like a good boy.
It seems fine.
Yes, this was Victor's... the Baron's medical library.
I put her in the guest room, just down the hall.
Why did you do that?
Break that old man's violin.
The old violinist -- you smashed his violin over your knee.
Saturday night then!  I'll take the train to New York and fly from there.
A piece of what?
How old are you, young man?
Hearts and kidneys are Tinker Toys! I'm talking about the Central Nervous System.
I'm sure we will.
I beg your pardon?
Was he any good?
Who are you talking to?
I didn't make a 'yummy' sound -- I just asked what it was.
... Whew!  I'm glad that's over with.
Come on, Froderick -- none of that.
That sound good, boss.
I'll bet it's a doozy.
Is everything ready?
MMMmmmmmmmm.
Diff'rent types who wear a day coat, pants with stripes and cutaway coat, perfect fits.........................
How nice.
We only arrived a few minutes ago.
Well.. I suppose it would be all right, for just a little while.
Yes, you may... but don't make any noise.
All right then, quietly!  Close your robe and stay right behind me. Don't make a sound!
Perhaps we'd better leave.
Me?  Sing?
I think so.
Good night!
I've missed you intellectually, too, Doctor.
I say, it wouldn't be fair to you... or to me.
Yes, Elizabeth has hers.
Yes, sweetie...I heard you.  So! I'm ready for you, meine Liebe.
MMMMMMmmmmmmmmm!
Why certainly.  Don't you, Frau Blucher?
Sounds like visitors.  It's all right -- Frau Blucher will show them in.
Franz!  Help!  Lunatic!
One Zulu is only one man.. ..and I'm afeared of no one man... but the Zulu, they come in the thousands.... like a black wave of death.... in the thousands.... and them assegais.... stabbing!
So attack is your defence. Well let's hope Cetshwayo will offer his Impis full destruction.
Certainly, Sin
Good ones, yes, Mr Vereker. Gentlemen who can ride and shoot
