### Author notes

I'm still in the brainstorming process. I created this repository with the intention to keep track of my work and hopefully become more motivated with this project. I don't know how much I can do in the following months because I have some exams to take care of, but I believe that I will start working consistently on this project in the summer.
If you have any ideas regarding an item in the buckerlist or think it would be cool to add another feature, please let me know!
