# Kat.ai

Kat.ai, or Kat for short, is a multi-platform chatbot with day to day capabilities that adapts while talking with you. This project aims to speed up the transition of AI into people's life by providing the user with ease of access. Kat will be able to run in any environment and, by using the ChatterBot dialog engine, speak any language.

The posibilities are endless when it comes to the customization:
* Add your own 3d or 2d models and backgrounds.
* User made themes.
* Add your own voice bank.
* Implement custom commands.
* Sculpt Kat's personality to match your own or make it the opposite.
* More to come.

## Requirements

* Python 2.7+
* Kivy 1.10.0+
* ChatterBot 0.8.1
<br> More to be added.

## Bucketlist

### Things that require immediate attention
* Build the graphical interface using kivy.
* Add Live2d or 3d models with OpenGL
* Create the deep-learning algorithm for recognizing user input and creating an eloquent answer.
* Add text-to-speech.
* Modify the weather script to get a more accurate prediction and make it much faster.

### Medium term goals
* Implement a back-up system using a cloud of user's choice.
* Find a way to use the deep learning algorithm to recognize when the user requests something.
* Add day to day capabilities like alarms, weather report, books and song recommendations, task reminder, finance, news, groceries, etc.
* Enable user to add his own 3d or 2d models.

### Long term goals
* Implement animations.
* Implement face, voice and mood recognition features.
* Add emotions and user modes that will fit different situations.
* Make Kat remember previous messages in the conversations.
* Enable real-time access on all devices, meaning that you can talk with her on your phone and see the result on your personal computer without too much delay.

### Never-ending goals
* Improve the accuarcy of the deep-learning algorithm.
* Make Kat as human-like as possible.
 
## Author notes

This will be a long journey. I created this repository with the intention to keep track of my work and hopefully become more motivated with this project. I don't know how much I can do in the following months because I have some exams to take care of, but I believe that I will start working consistently on this project after graduating this year from highschool. I'm open to new ideas and hopefully, with the experience I will gather in the next few years and with the development of open source technologies that I could use, I can bring Kat to a build that is working decently.
